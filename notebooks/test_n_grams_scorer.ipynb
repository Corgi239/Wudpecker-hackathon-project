       "       \"well, is everyone happy with if i_ you can look at what i've already started, to write up for the problem statement, mhm we can always add, and  (xx) it's right there i think one person, in, in this case you,  okay  and it's only a draft (so you know) if, sure and   mhm...    um, we hafta work on our goal, too and maybe we should do that as a group because Glenda had, the good point that it seems to presume, um, presumes that restoration, is... is a definite outcome. it's just the first sentence she doesn't like. yeah, i- but i mean, a- she_ it's not that she doesn't a- it's not that she doesn't like what we're saying it's just how we're saying it... we've got to, sort of um... put a spin on it that is more open-ended. okay mhm, yeah but (isn't it...) G- Glenda really has a problem with it? i was um let's see, what i so what i tried to do was to work from our from the problem sorta the problem statement, into a goal. and, we have a sentence in the problem statement now that says, that identifies MEANDRS' goal, mhm mhm (i mean) i think it doesn't, it doesn't a- address that, that, Glenda's concerns. yeah mhm mhm    mhm, i can't find something what are you looking for? something that i wrote. why don't we just, why don't we just define, as our goal well, i think one way to m- maybe make it easier is, in the, problem statement we defined, MEANDRS' objectives, and i and i think that's good. and i don't think we need to really rehash those in our goal. okay mhm i- i- if we just eliminate, the part of the goal, of the   okay.  so you would just say m- instead of, you know to assist them. yep mhm okay  that doesn't, look good see that was the problem i was having. when i would just try to take it out, then you would sort of lose the  yeah to the sounds good. i like it. does that sound, mhm   let me just rephrase this let's just write it up here or something so we can, take (note of it) so what is it? to evaluate existing conditions or, yeah or assess or, yeah, i think assess. you want identify? i don't know... assess kinda sounds like you're gonna, judge it yep (from future) rehabilitation effort? um n- well then that's getting into the presumption, (you know) if you say  okay  um  i came across um, i know we had problems with pros and cons before yeah okay i don't know, it was just another practical opportunities? possibilities. two Ss? uh yes (okay) so_ or maybe you know even just possibilities and limitations or, something i don't know. um yeah we're not biased now. yeah what is a feasibility study? it's... i mean i i think you can- i don't think there's any set, definition of a feasibility study but essentially you're just identifying, the limitations and, constraints, of a of a proposed, um, a you know proposed project, to determine whether or not, it_ you know and then, depending on what your_ you consider your your ultimate constraint, is it financial? is it, public acceptance? i think it's, y- you know based on your constraints, can can this project be done? i was thinking we could even maybe just cut the middle sentence out. okay mhm or you know we could, we could essentially leave, leave this out. yeah cuz yeah, i think,  what if we put in here to predict, potential changes, you know, limitations, and possibilities? i, i think, like if we're gonna do the whole like start narrow and and, and expand as we go out if we just leave it as, potential changes, um... because i think the limitations and possibilities    that's including, this? yeah. i mean that's just my take on it. okay yeah that's what i that's valid. what i think, i- is that feasibility encompasses, most of what is there you know mkay cuz i mean, the first sentence so we say the  what? i mean the first sentence is basically our goal is to like,  right identify, i don't like the word identify  (xx) uh... oh usually my English is, not, okay the problem is is that, when you get into syntax, it becomes, whoever's reading it is gonna interpret  (is to) describe, or,   but describe also also implies, mm, basically that all the information is all the things that, are laid out right, and we could come up and, describe them. what about determine? no determine's very, rigid. yeah hm examine. examine? that's kind of like it is a little bit better i would agree. more like explore how 'bout explore? what about analyze? that's very yeah that's uh explore's kinda neat. explore to me is more of a journey, it's kinda like, you're, uh, you don't know what you're gonna find, you don't know, you know and there's like sort of no defined end point to exploring it's just... examine when i think of examine i think of, someone looking under a microscope. okay okay  yeah, i don't like the last two.  you know we can also we can digest this for a little while right  yeah let's just put explore in there   yeah      mm yeah, um so uh, um... yeah, of course i have uh, my favorite word, but uh, um, i don't know, my choices are (appro-) more appropriate  okay. okay. yeah okay. so, uh, becau- not why. um the current and historical conditions, are not so clear, i think. so, um, we must, we must, search, uh what i- what, what are the current and historical conditions, so explore is more appropriate. okay, yeah okay historical conditions?  i don't know. this charac- or status, state? how 'bout oh the other thing i had written down, um yeah, that's good yeah. (xx) to use (a) watershed approach to do you hafta go? yeah. (um) yeah. (xx) okay so you'll work on the literature review stuff,  yeah, all my stuff and (then) do you need Glenda's comments? yeah cuz i think those are more_ most um applicable  i wanna s- what? d- do you guys wanna, meet, meet the three of us at all over the weekend or just wait until Monday? um i want i want to meet. okay okay, Sunday afternoon? Sunday Sunday evening? yeah Sunday, ab- Sunday at about five? what, what's your schedule on Sunday? um, Sunday,  yeah i, like last week uh i i w- i will have a r- a meeting, uh at eleven A-M.  is five o'clock good? okay no problem cuz i have a meeting at eight P-M, (xx) okay okay okay uhuh mhm  yeah yeah um okay five P-M then, yeah. um want a copy of 'em? there. (i s that Glenda's stuff?) um, actually,  oh yeah, please. do you want to just give him this one? sure okay, yeah his are um, kinda this handwriting, and Geoff's are, in there too. mine's, his are the more blocky, yeah yeah, (xx,) (these are the ones, in capitals) yeah... mine are the ones that have a lot of scribbles through them and stuff. yeah so i'll see you guys on Sunday see you okay did you do well, last night? uh, who else won? i only know that Minnesota won and that um, a- all the favorites won okay, then i did, one two  yeah.  Kentucky was the only they, yeah i fell asleep lis- Kentucky's just boring they were, they were like, winning too, easily. Kentucky was the only one (that,) U-C-L-A was losing by sixteen, at one point. they came back but they came back. so i_ that wasn't g- i picked i had, o- on one of mine i had um, i had Iowa State, (xx) one i had U-C-L-A they came back, and (xx,) it was, like to the last second did you watch that game? yeah what time did it get over? like at nine. it was so, weird. they were up by, they were up by, by, two, right? U-C-L-A? U-C-L-A. yeah with, like, four seconds left, (xx) and then, um, they fouled somebody th- Iowa State (just like) fouled somebody, so they went, they went (xx) missed one two U-C-L-A guys, got the rebound, and they were fighting for the ball,  to Iowa? to Iowa State with four seconds down one. so they inbound from, from the um, okay, i think so we'll talk ab- we can talk about it. okay? okay yeah um, physical tasks, are missing. mhm um, well let's, let's work on getting the the methods, mhm mhm    mhm. this is actually this was Pat. uhuh... green, green writing is? is Geoff. Geoff, okay i had an idea, for this, um that (cord's) kind of a hazard. does it come out?     i i can there's one behind you there. oh Hiro? hm? okay this_ now Martin can trip over it. (xx) Martin um... to predict, potential changes that may result from rehabilitation... or that could,  to or and? i think and (xx) (entities)   yeah. does that sound good? mhm Hiro, do you like that? yeah okay is that written down somewhere  (could put) it in i can put th- i'll put that in... actually should   yeah i like the beginning, yeah what put watershed-based,  i've heard it like so many different ways, i think it's    yeah i mean i've heard it used, watershed-based watershed approach,   do you wanna get together y- just like you and i, on, Monday morning and, sorta, like we did last week and just sort of put everything together? yeah we could do that um,  yeah. yeah, i think you are th- you and i are the only ones   okay pull it together, and then any extra time we have we can,  okay Geoff? yes? um, before pre- predict yeah no i don't think it is necessary, because we're not, to would mean, um, well i was, having  i was trying to get rid of some of the tos yeah,    mhm yeah uhuh okay. uhuh okay.   Hiro, it's one of the finer points, of grammar   it's, it's  okay    i think that would be it is by, by by using  yeah, to explore the goal is by,  okay right well that's one rea- that's_ you could put it here and then, say, a goal, the goal is to explore the current and  oh  yeah uhuh mhm i think with you have this to here, and this to here, i think that, makes it okay. okay uhuh, yeah  do you understand? yeah  mhm okay... yeah i've_ actually, i need to, get some stuff so i've got about half an hour left, okay okay what was that Martin? um, do we wanna, go over the objectives? um, or figure out who's gonna work on, which part, or we kinda work on our own parts i guess but... um  and we also say the Dowagiac river   okay because, you know we took out um okay yeah okay i think we can b- we can bring this into our problem statement and our objectives and (like,) and just make it clear up front and also wa- we wanted to also bring in water, water, quality, cuz Glenda po- pi- mhm water, i think, can i put it there? (oh yeah) (on the) water quality yeah, okay, so, i guess our objectives are still to... determine how, rehabilitation okay you wanna w- ca- let's work off  yeah. there's a... yeah okay (xx) i'm using green. we should all (like) pick a color. that, sorta stands out oh okay um, you can use blue. um, so, with this goal in mind... do we wanna add in a an objective to, explore to explore, the current and historical characteristics, and then... um, and have that as a goal, or an objective, and then, to lead on from that, okay okay mhm, (xx) okay um, determine how determine  yeah. now, i- Pat was concerned that objective two and j- objective three, three mhm, right or the, why don't we, since they are_ they_ i mean there's a fine point between, sort of identifying things, and judging them. yeah we could either combine 'em or i just simply put in, you know we could say instead of identify quanta- you know i- quantifying, it's kinda hard, it kinda depends how, you define, mhm right in the big picture, (or,) you know, that's    right, okay  right okay. to, maybe, um establish?  uh, e- evaluate? evaluate right i uh, i uh think that's what we wanna say. yeah, so let's try evaluate there. and, let's just leave it really, really simple (it)   (xx) this is,  okay, identify, we can change that again, to change it to explore, or um, identify okay... examine possible, effects of restoration... cuz that's, examine's like, okay, okay okay, well okay take take it out. okay this is the same it's the same thing we were just doing. right i don't think explore quite works there though. no. mm, maybe list? (xx) mhm um, isn't, evaluate appropriate? um,  mhm  mhm  uhuh okay  like ba- just, so i remember those words based on our research and, knowledge (xx...) and (xx) of the system, (xx?) yeah, just, leave it there in case we wanna stick something like that in there. okay. um... can you predict, possible effects of restoration? that's more, see that's more the next, right this is, or, this is  yeah, so i was thinking here predict possible effects. okay. i don't know i just took it from down there. yeah, okay, no that's sounds good predict... is that what we used up there? yeah... predict, p- or potential, possible? predict possible effects of restoration on the social, socioeconomic well, okay predict possible, let's just put it in there predict possible changes that could, result from rehabilitation, that's where we'll put, that's where we'll put,   yeah yeah okay, yeah okay hm? no no no, this is, this is, this is pros and cons. yeah, but so is this one this is_ i just changed the (page.) (xx) right. isn't practical  uh i was thinking of using that as a, a synonym for pros and cons. possibilities and limitations. oh okay. but... now what were you saying? that's fine. no i see what you're saying.  sh- b- yeah just just throw it in there with our other words, yeah i like limitations but i don't like possibilities      correct yeah   it's sort of_ it's got a cross over between ecology and social,  yeah right. mhm   yeah. mhm  mhm yeah. that sounds good... so i think Glenda just saw it sort of floating out there, yeah  especially since there wasn't anything underneath it. right.  i think so as opposed to bullets. yeah. bullets_ they kind of said task circle which  yeah right... okay. oh i i guess we should a- maybe we should fill in Hiro a little bit on, mhm uhuh...  uhuh mhm  right. so, the way that they_ we sort of all of us, decided that the methods are more conceptual, mhm okay. uhuh okay. mhm  mhm      okay,  uhuh  mhm  uhuh   okay. and what we were gonna_ we're gonna focus on, objectives, predominantly objectives, and then methods, and we'll worry about tasks, mhm  okay, okay, i see. and then time line and budget, after we've done the tasks... okay thanks. yeah. sorry i forgot to yeah no uh'uh. yeah um, i i am uh i can_ i could imagine uh from Glenda's comment. okay. mhm. okay.   we didn't get into that and  right. mhm  right  mhm okay mhm. okay... and uh, Glenda m- m- mentioned, our li- our literature re- review, mhm mhm right.  uhuh about halfway down  in quotes   okay. not so much specific articles, mhm,  yeah. mhm the effects of agricultural runoff, yeah  um, so  mhm  okay. okay. mm so she told us uh to choose uh our interest topic?  okay. um, she, i think what she said was, we just had, a list,  mhm okay i (see.) mhm  she wants to know where we're going with the literature, okay.  mhm   mhm yes. okay. it's like what information we intend to get out of  i see. (easy.) um, okay so that was objective six was was pretty good mm (you have to go?) uh couple_ i could_ like, ten minutes. okay... why don't we um... what was your ins- it's kinda hard_ i still think like in a sense maybe just Pat doesn't know yet, how he feels about it, but that, you don't really have to have, a a scientific hypothesis, right mhm yeah and then mhm right.  yes. okay. you know maybe would restoring MEANDRS to the Dowagiac system be a feasible method for rehabilitating? ins- as opposed to will restoring? yeah. okay... yeah ye- yes. and then that's not as, definite that it's gonna happen. or reha- we gotta get rehabilitation    of the Dowagiac, river system, be a feasible,  approach... (xx,) for... for MEANDRS. cuz we're we're just, you know we're trying to answer_ their question is, is... is rehabilitation, the way to go? yeah... for MEANDRS, to, pursue.  to reach their goal? i don't think that necessarily to reach it just to  goal of, and then go back to our problem statement. rehabilitating and preserving the integrity of the watershed? how about improving or how about um, enhancing, protecting, improving, of yeah...  (xx) economic, agricultural, um isn't it needs isn't that the end? needs... of the  (xx.) alright let's... um, changes resulting from, rehabilitation... Glenda had a comment on that one.  i think he took it but i've got a copy. (xx) no i think it was just a specific comment  oh. okay. okay. mm okay... and then i think this one's okay okay okay, um, methods yeah. yes. yeah for what? restoration options scenarios type oh um... um  now, um, Glenda indicate indicates you don't discuss possible alternatives, mhm we talked about that. yeah uhuh  what what we decided Hiro, um... Pa- Pat seemed to think it was really important to look at it as a system, mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm okay mhm yeah,   mhm, mhm okay.  okay... mhm  okay does that make sense? okay... um... so i think with these, we need to, save all of this, and we can use that in a in the task (yep) yeah well yeah   like baseline information on river flow, and, um, it it's sort of it's sorta the same stuff but without um (xx)   review maps, review maps, um, talk to people look at photographs, yep. yeah. again sort of, what we um, how we attend how we intend to uh, to, to meet our objectives... okay mhm mhm (xx) mhm  mhm mhm... okay  um a question. how uh ho- how we will, how will we_ how will we, um answer our research questions?  we have an extra, objective in here too.   okay  um, we, created a new objective mhm mhm  um yes current and historical, characteristics okay... the_ i i was just going through what we talked about yesterday. mhm okay. okay.  okay. so, what we're gonna do okay and ano- Hiro, and the other way that it was phrased was, a conceptual discussion of the approach, that you'll take. mhm okay... okay... yeah. yeah. okay, that helps... um... okay actually i'm gonna hafta go, okay uhuh. okay. lemme just write down... objectives (that we need) let me just (xx) (fix up)  i think that's okay cuz, okay okay okay. okay. um, do you wanna meet at like eight thirty on Monday? yeah. or i- what's the_ when do you usually get in? and i'll just it, depends eight thirty's, okay i didn't know whether you were there actually earlier um, i mean sh- i can be, probably not then. okay. that's okay.  Monday morning okay. okay. (cool) (can i) meet you at NUBS again? okay. okay... and uh, um, for Monday, uh, when w- will we meet uh for (later) class? four o'clock? four thirty.  we have class on Monday at four thirty. oh it's a master's (xx)   they're gonna talk about presentations uhuh okay. okay... do you guys know yet when you'll be presenting? um i sent  yeah on the thirty-first. (xx) mhm... but that hasn't been confirmed yet. if that's when we, i'm just thinking more people probably want to go later than early. i don't think we'll have a problem yeah... okay... um, Geoff um mor- um sorry. Ma- Martin? yes. may i keep this? yeah i need to make a copy of that. okay okay  okay. okay... okay well thanks a lot for, working on this, this weekend too. mhm  wanna take my snowshoes?  got your waders? yep those too. okay. (excuse me) (xx) (your way,) okay i'll see you    yeah you too. bye so do you want to come over with me while i make a copy of that and then i'll give it to you or do you want me to leave it in your  which is easier? oh, thanks. which is would you wanna_ me to leave it in your mail folder or do you wanna just come with me? um yeah i wi- i will go with  \",\n",
       "       \"my name's Tom Lehker and i'm a staff member at the Career Planning and Placement office. uh this is a program we hav- as far as i know we have never done before, um we're co-sponsoring it with Rackham, um uh the idea of sort of what it means to be a faculty member as a panel really came from students at some of the other events that we had, um as we would collect our student evaluations which i'll have you fill out at the end of this program. one of the events that students talked about having was something that really, gave faculty a chance to talk about. issues of of faculty culture or faculty roles, um expectations of junior faculty and how those expectations might, um change as a faculty member, uh progresses through a career, um, maybe some of the myths, um myths and or realities that graduate students had, i'm hearing from a lot of graduate students they just didn't hear much from, uh their advisors and other faculty members about what it really did mean to be a faculty member. so we uh decided to do this type of panel to start to address some of those kind of issues. partly knowing that many of these issues are very specific to the individual student or also possibly very discipline-specific. so i think that's one of the limitations that we acknowledge going into something like this, is that we're hoping that the panelists um can speak sort of as generally as possible but also knowing that they will always speak, from the framework of their own, um process that they went through. um, let me just say a couple things sort of administratively before we get started, and one is to say up front that we were supposed to have three panelists today. but i got a call from Professor Rose from the history department literally about an hour ago, she could hardly speak, and said she was too ill to attend. uh but we're left uh with two uh very fine panelists, we'll have um, Farnam Ja- Jahanian, um from the EECS department up in engineering, and also Professor Dickerso- um, Glenda Dickerson, who's also, in the theater department and also an associate dean here at Rackham. and is making her stage entrance (it's very nice) on cue. we're just getting started. good. um, and so the idea of this panel will be that um um, both of the panelists will speak for some amount of time, ten fifteen minutes uh potentially longer if you like given that we're we're short one panelist today, um i gave them some questions that they might want to think about along the lines as i was outlining earlier but then also hoping that question and answer which i always think is is always very helpful in this type of setting. um and so in just a minute i will turn it over to them, i am gonna pass out a couple things, the first is, program evaluation if you could take just a couple of minutes at the end of the program and fill that out. um again it's the evaluations in past years that have led to events like this so we really do take, your feedback seriously. the other, is just a clipboard, if you could also, sign in. uh, we like to, keep a record of who attends these programs it helps us to, justify our, existence, uh for things like this. so i think that was all, i wanted to say i think maybe if the panelists wanna come up now we haven't talked about an order for who would like to go first so you can, flip a coin or could i ask a question before we get started? sure. i was just wondering if you could raise your hands if you're, here because you're not sure if you wanna be a faculty member that you might be interested in a nonacademic career... okay, thank you. so, would you like to start, Mrs Dickerson? well i could i  okay (xx) graduate students (xx) uh again my name is Glenda, um Dickerson, and i wanted to ask how many of you if any of you are artists? wha- what department are you in? i'm in English. and what kind of art do you practice? direct plays and write poetry. fabulous. okay so is i- what's your name? Andrew. Andrew. is Andrew the only one then? if we like to dance does that count? yes that counts okay and what about_ is there anyone else here who's in English? who writes, or directs or, paints or... so what are you all thinkers? economics mhm, and you?  mechanical. and you? chemistry chemistry and you on the floor? pharmaceutics uhuh and you in the blue shirt and the glasses? (public accounting) uhuh and, you? chemistry okay. um, one more. b- all the way back there the back in the beige, cable-knit sweater. i'm in material science and engineering in materials okay so, my discipline is theater as you may have heard. i write plays i direct plays i um, make, i make plays i make projects i make big community projects out of, nondramatic sources and i make them into dramatic events. so you would say well, our interests, couldn't be farther apart. political thinker writer, um, commentator can you tell me something that he wrote? um, Giovanni's Room, um  (xx) um Amiri Baraka, formerly known as LeRoi Jones was another um, black writer a poet um, poet essayist, thinker yeah he was a and a revolutionary thinker yeah yeah yeah noninteractive teaching huh? noninteractive teaching.  Dunry Dunry? mhm so it's easy for me to say well Dunry what do you think about what i just said? but i don't care what she thinks. um i'd like to to start with a question to um Professor Dickerson. um, i know that you, taught at Spelman before coming to University of Michigan i was wondering if you could, comment on the differences of teaching, ah right, well. um... i started out at Howard University, which is a small African-A_ well it's not so small it's a it's a university but it's small compared to here it's an African-American institution that was kinda my first job, and then i spent the rest of my career at I- at the State University of New York, which is a large institution at the State University of New Jersey which is a large institution, and i went from those places, to Spelman College. which is a small African-American women's college in Atlanta Georgia. uh the president was Jeanette Cole who some of you may even have have seen or know of you know they call her America's Sister President she was a remarkable woman. and she took Spelman from this little colored girls college you know missionary college, to this major institution that was known all over the world and it was just, remarkable how in ten years she transformed the face of that institution but, it was so small... a- and there were no graduate, ps- you know classes there were no graduate students and so, the difference is that when you're talking about interdisciplinarity at Spelman, you're talking about about two people. yes some questions for you i have sure sorry i don't remember your name Farnam Farnam? yes number one, can you talk more about what your evenings are like? sure number two, and weekends mm oh yeah. i i can i can whip 'em out believe it or not. no actually it takes longer than that. uh, i- i- i- it often, i was hoping it wouldn't  mhm  my, uh it's called geoscience and remote sensing it's a combination of, the electrical mm mhm so it has to do i- with uh applying the information gathered by satellites that are orbiting the earth, mhm mhm  for example i mean i i need to write a a a paper for an upcoming conference mhm sure   ohh mhm   excuse me well i think too that there's also another way to think about structuring a day and a week. a day doesn't have to be divided up into hours and and and two-hour slots and i think, are other people interested in this question or or sh- yeah often though when i'm m- i had a lot m- n- numerous hours on my schedule that said meeting with research students, what i found out is that unless we're working on a paper for example. often an hour is a reasonable amount of time, to to give feedback and essentially find out what's going on and work through some of the details. um, one of the things that we attempt to do in my group is essentially to avoid having, long-drawn meetings mhm mhm mhm did you have your hand up? yeah, i'm in environmental education and i wanna teach, worse than anything in the world and maybe it's just a perception problem on my part but i, have a real hard time kinda with, with that kind of a snapshot of a day. i'd really like to have my days pretty much the other way around that, like all the time that you get to spend mentoring i wouldn't mind being in the classroom, or maybe, mentoring small projects or whatever even for undergrads. but the research meetings, and th- the amount that if you are going to actually get tenured and actually mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah that's right that's right. well you know one of the things that i wanted to say in my remarks and i didn't say is you know one the most important pieces of advice i could give you as a, young, faculty, m- uh, per- perspective faculty member is, to try to attach yourself to an institution that has a mentoring, system in place. and that, that will, that the department even, a- a- formally, pairs you, with a senior, faculty member who will mentor you. through some of those very tricky questions because, i think, you know this is this is one of the more supportive envir- um institutions that i've worked in you know i've worked in a lot of institutions where you're really just thrown out there you just really on your own. and that's when junior faculty member are really at risk, you know they can't win for losing. just as you're saying, you know you've got to, yeah you've gotta get your research done, you've gotta keep publishing you know, you have to s- sublimate sometimes your real interest which is to extend what you are doing out into the community. so i would say two things to you i would say one is the match, you know, find the right institution, for you. but, once you find that institution that you like, you must have a senior, faculty member to mentor you because there is a way to balance all those things and there is a way, to have value placed on some of these nontraditional things, not even really nontraditional but what, you know that you value there's a way to have them weighted and and valued and so you know_ because you can imagine with me coming through i didn't have a Phd you know i didn't publish you know, my, creative work was my research. but i was in a state university and they didn't know what that meant. i was way back there when we had to fight, not to have to publish. in order to get tenure you know, so, i know what that battle looks like, and i know that there's been a lot of progress made, and i i just think, you can have, the academic life that you want. i know that you can. it's finding, the right match. uh i don't know if you're, tenured or are you? yes, oh yeah okay, i i'm not sure when you when you were up for tenure maybe uh the transition was easier for you cuz you worked in  sure, a a, so uh what did my schedule look like when i was, before tenure? um mhm mhm mhm mhm  but could we keep uh keep the dialogue going? we have another question sure sure i have a it's uh, shifting to a different topic actually. please mhm  um, i'm in the Department of Health Management Policy in the School of Public Health. and why is it that you don't have the opportunity to teach? they don't, um, they don't have T-A positions for, most it's a master_ it's a professional school most of the courses are taught, by the professors and, graded and evaluated, students are graded and evaluated by the professors, rather than by T-As. mhm mhm try Psychology, they're always looking for T-As (xx) do you have any, thoughts on that? it was naive go ahead  i've also, just (i could say) i worked with students who have also taught (xx) courses at four-year colleges. i worked with a student who taught a summer course at at Kalamazoo College for example so i think community college is one that wouldn't have to be limited to that either i think mhm mhm yeah uh (in) my case i i don't wanna have a tenure-track position or something. i want to stay here, after i get my PhD degree, for like two years or something just to have the experience and then go back to my country which  mhm  i'm in, computer information system in the business school. okay C-I-S C-I-S mhm mhm in a in generally, you know gen- generally speaking? yeah um, i wanna look at the first part of your question, you said that your preference would be to stay here at the university for another couple of years,   oh stay in this country yes yeah yeah yeah mhm uh you're on your own Glenda i just heard about it today, that's why it's fresh on my mind, because i have to sit on a, a committee i found out to evaluate, um applications for the distinguished fellow. distinguished dissertation but this is a College of Fell- it's like a post-doc and and and and p- and uh students come from all over, and there're twelve of them i think each, i think she said there were twelve of them, each year. they're twelve continuing ones so i guess there're more all the time. cuz they can come, every year. but you know i mean that's right here you might look into that that's a Rackham_ has something to do with Rac- i think it's_ i'm pretty sure it's called, the College of Fellows you can speak with Glenda Haskell... yeah? i was wondering if you could talk about, a little bit about, the sort of politics of teaching and, uh how you have to, balance between, personal issues. agendas uh, kind of departmental, issues um especially when developing course content or, mhm yes yes yeah it's really it's a it's a real, challenge. and th- the first challenge is that you know teaching is so hard this is what i really, you know so many graduate students are just kind of thrown out there and you know put on tenure-track lines or whatever and expected to be teachers. you know where do you learn that? you know you learn through observation and if you don't observe a good teacher then you ain't_ there's no reason that you're going to be a good teacher. so that's the first challenge you're trying to find your way you're trying to find your style you're trying to, you know get your courage up and not be intimidated you know by these thirty open faces looking you know looking to you to know everything. um, so, you have to balance you know like like all of that stuff so i think um, i think... in terms of the politics of the situation, here's one good thing about the academy. even though we tell all of these horrible, you know these horror stories about you know the poor untenured faculty you know the junior faculty and they're so at risk, you know which is true of course. but you know the other side of that is that you really are someplace, where it is really hard for you to lose your job for holding an unpopular, opinion. you know it's not like the corporate world in that sense you know they really do take, the f- you know your first amendment rights seriously so that you know if you are um, if you are, if you are prepared if you can, you know support what you are doing in the classroom and if you believe in the style which you have, uh built up, you know for yourself, then i don't think that you have to you know_ but now here's what they do in one department i know which i won't mention any names, but there's a real split between, th- the practical, faculty and the, scholars. there's a real split. that's fine you know they don't agree on anything. you know that's you know that's okay but what happens is that there's all this bitching and backbiting and nastiness that goes on in the classroom where these people b- use their students as pawns to get their point of vie- you know that was just, so bad what that person did and which i think is just reprehensible and that's i mean a- a- and you know you're gonna find that i don't know what you can do about that all i can say is that you have to just navigate your way through like you are walking through a landmine u- u-well i think um, going back to what i said about intellectual freedom that's absolutely true. i think in companies if if you have an unpopular position they probably promote you to get you out of that department. mhm mhm yes yes that's right mhm mhm mhm mhm right mhm mhm mhm mhm  hm and you don't have to go to a research institution either. not at on- one of my students is actually, is just doing what you're interested in doing bear with me for a minute i'll share you with you a story. sh- she came to me and said you know, i love doing research but i don't wanna do_ spend hundred percent of my time essentially worrying about research which at most research universities, overwhelming majority of our time is spent worrying about research. and mentoring graduate students she said that's not what i wanna do i wanna go to a place and i wanna do teaching. and what we did was we sat down and we went through a list of, and the job market for computer scientists is pretty good so we went through a list of you know, probably a hundred universities that had, positions open. and i just essentially helped her eliminate, majority of universities that i thought had the culture that did not suit her interest. mhm mhm mhm yes one or two for more questions? yes uh this is really an extension of the last comment but i was wondering if you could, uh speak a little more to the pitfalls that, await junior faculty, members and mistakes that junior faculty members, tend to make especially coming from a large research institution like this one and maybe only having been in that environment and moving to a different, kind of institution say a smaller, mhm mhm mhm you know what the biggest mistake i think junior faculty make is not understanding the climate of the department that they are entering. because junior faculty are always piled up with a lot of work they're always spinning their wheels and always overworked and, and under-rested, but you might be putting your energy to the wrong thing and not even know it. and so i think the, most important thing, the biggest pitfall i think to avoid, is, not to be spending, you know expending all of your energy working for the department because that's all of_ always you know you get all the, you know the, committee assignments that nobody else wants you know and you you know you're directing two plays in your first semester you know in in my world and uh, you know you have, you know you're asked to take on the overload would you mind you know teaching four classes and you say oh yes yes yes yes yes yes trying to be, you know accommodating you know, and then you find out when you get your first three-year, evaluation, if you're, in the tenure stream if you're on your way to tenure then you get, then you find out that, this isn't weighted you know as much as you thought it was and this doesn't count at all and this is really not valued what he really should have been doing, is this this and this and this. and so i would say, really get a clear understanding get it in writing if you can from your chair when you begin a tenure-track position as to really what the department's expectations of you are in your first year. and get a clear understanding that, at your three-year review if there is such a thing if there isn't such a thing, can i in fact have an informal three-year review. where we sit down together, and we look back over the three years and you tell me what my strengths are, from the department's point of view, and what my weaknesses are what you'd like to see me strengthen what you'd like to see me improve in my next three years. then you have some protection, if you're denied tenure. you have some protection by_ because you have this document that says these were the things that i was told to work on and i did and this is how you document, you kno- i i published five articles. i have my book coming out, i you know sat on three you know, scholarly journals or you know o- or you know whatever. so tha- i that's what i would think. that clear understanding of what the expectations are and don't let yourself get overworked, if it's not going to directly, enhance your tenure, um portfolio. if it's something you wanna do, that is not valued, find a way to get it valued. you know find a way to get it and get f- it in writing. i think the biggest pitfall for junior faculty members is that, you have to be careful. you wanna be a good citizen but don't overdo it. mhm mhm mhm mhm  yep how do you say no? oh you just draw the line. and what you do is a good department, when you approach them, we do this in in E-E-C-S. with, first of all junior faculty members the first two years are given no official service req- assignment. mhm mhm mhm  mhm mhm mhm right  swamped  we have a last quick, relatively quick question? yeah? how many people don't get tenure? you know i was very shocked i don't know what your experience with it i was really shocked when i find out how many people go all the way up through those seven years and they do not get tenured. i mean i was really shocked when i began, and you can't see why. you know it's like you just simply cannot please, some institutions you know you can't they've done everything they've published and then, but they're p- you know it's just not seen good enough and it's not prestigious enough and it's just not fit, enough. so i would say i don't know any statistics maybe, maybe some of my colleagues do but i would say a lot. we- is that a third question to ask a search committee? what percent of   (yeah) actually ask ask the uh j- not just the search committee ask various faculty members ask the dean. and here's the reason you should ask it. in fact a lot of universities when you go for an interview, they tell you that wow we are a very tough place   mhm yes mhm mhm   don't  and that's what   yeah yeah  right  that's right  right mhm mhm mm mm mhm mhm mhm mhm that's right it's very important that the institution that you apply to at a_ finally align yourself with is a nurturing, institution. because there are a lot of institutions, who, have the attitude that my colleague says, well we'll hire you, you know and you're out there on your own no guidance and if you can get through us then you deserve tenure and if you can't you know so what. and nobody can, succeed in that situation and nobody should have to and nobody should want to. so the important thing is to ask the right per- i think a great workshop, would be questions, to ask, on your interviews. when you're going to interview for your first tenure-track,  oh there there there're people who've put stuff like this together my students have tracked 'em down. and there's stuff that that're available that, it's maybe particular to engineering (xx) discipline, i'm not sure. but i know uh, my student was telling me because i go over a list of questions that they should be asking us all, and she had a list of like a hundred questions she had come up with, that she found on-line. search for it if you can't find it send me email i- i'll find it for you. actually there was a workshop like that   oh i was wondering about that i do wanna thank the panelists again for coming out thank you all good job if you would take a couple of minutes to fill out those evaluations i would appreciate it you didn't tell us that we were gonna be  \",\n",
       "       \"far you got in the readings and what, readings you did. uh i read the first uh just up to transparency on phenomenal illusions and, (actually) finished reading  yeah. yeah finished reading the one from    how far'd you get   no i haven't read Tye okay so we don't have any overlap alright um  yeah. yeah. those are the sort of the cases that (we) presented on the, first, day, right the the case of the, two trees (with) the two trees we already talked about that? first day   alright. okay. so we talked about, and also y- y- y- you've raised it in another thing that you wrote uh, talking about the, um... i forget exactly exactly how you'd how you worked it out but we did talk about some. okay then um, then, i i i i figured with the shorter, shortened week we might be like this so i, brought some stuff to... to do. not so we weren't driven just by your questions. um, but if you have stuff you wanna raise about what you read i_ what i would do, left to my own devices is to, tell you what i'm trying to do in this, phenomenal illusions paper. summary form and stuff like that. um, if you have questions about Tye, u- i- if you say we'd already discussed it then it might not be (hard) if you... if you  yeah this this was just the very beginning. that, uh talks about, uh uh Sartre's contention, uh that, we are under the illusion, that we have an image. uh, uh the the statement on on on this account, uh I'll read the sentence before this  no. the illusion of eminence. you see from like the first page or second page (or so) this is the only quote. yeah. right right. whatever. you may (have) right okay. the illusion of eminence. (but) it doesn't matter the words (you use) uhuh. it's, what what what's puzzling me about is that is that suppose i have an image in my mind of a, of a red fire truck, that's what he says that's what i think too that's what almost, everyone thinks but, you know, does that surprise you? w- you know that there's nothing (red)   alright. right yeah you don't an experience made of red, um  okay. so   okay. (alright.) okay. um uh alright so um, what i'm trying to do, is, is a is a bunch of things at once, um i- one of_ that paper that we did last time i'm trying to argue for the inner perception model from, a priori considerations right? mhm mhm. are the two mistakes of thinking that you have, through the the red that's out there, on the the transparency or the, diaphanous of  yeah the the the the the, the two illusions one, i should start calling it the likeness illusion rather than the image illusion but the the one, is roughly_ i'm gonna, hafta modify this later but roughly, the one illusion the image illusion is that you have, mental objects, with nonmental properties. um, so, a thing in your head a an image, a visual image that's_ has shape. uh um or, color, or size (something) motion, or uh um, or a uh, or a sound in your head a song in your head, uh kinda sound rhythm pitch and so forth. when there's nothing in your head (with) a- any of that stuff. um or in your mind or soul or whatever. um, so that's mental objects with nonmental properties and nicely (sort of) the transparency illusion is that there's nonmental objects, environmental objects bodily objects, nonben- nonmental objects with, mental properties some kind of, uh uh weird, dependent on your mind properties so, so um, the idea that, um... that uh um, you know the wall there not only has, um, uh shape, location, um, uh, mass, reflectance but also has, um, uh, a particular kinda shape look that can vary as you move or, or or reflectance look that can vary, according to, your sense organs, some some or or o- o- o- um, uh, the, the transparency illusion's harder to make out but it's but, the the best kind of examples i have is when you have a, shapes a, curved shape. and you, a- a- s- and mathematically or physically there's a, a a a be some account of curvature, and that's a property i'm not saying there's an illusion there, (xx) nonmental object really has that nonmental property, but, in perception it seems like it's got more properties than that, shape-related property so not only does it s- so you, you look at, you can you can be sensitive to the look of a, curve or the feel of a curve a blind person could. like you detect the feel of a curve. and, and uh a curve, look and a curve feel, the chair also seems to have the those properties, stuck on it, objectively it doesn't seem even though, even though... what a curve looks like and what a curve feels like are different from one another, and they're but even though they're detecting the same feature, they um curvature, uh they, um, uh, a- uh, and those differences, so i i we try to argue, do most likely depend on, the constitution of your sense organs, and, brain and so forth. uh uh uh um it doesn't seem like they do it doesn't seem like you help create, the look of the chair or the curve or or the feel of it it seems like you just passively discover it, um, and, so that's the sense in which a property, feature that really is, dependent on you seems not to be. and that's the transparency illusion. uh but, but, so so   right.   'm'm no alright but yeah i discuss that too (xx) that's a good question i'll keep it (xx) h- sorry how would you classify uh, these properties that Tye uses in the paper to talk about the illusions like looking,  oh looking bigger from here you should (xx) yeah. there is one little c- self-contained, section of my paper where i talk about, i talk about that and what he says is so weird, yeah. yeah. (xx) it's not long after this here's Peacock's case abbreviated and and this is, ah right. yeah that's it (xx) yes. yeah. right sure.    (mhm) i mean wh- look okay f- now do something do_ that doesn't involve do do auditory imagining, task that doesn't involve, or needn't involve, visual imagination. just, i'll be quiet and you, um you know sing to yourself some song you like some happy birthday or whatever right? uh um, do it.  yeah i was doing it fast. the end might be different.    you're bli-dih-dih-dih-dih-dih-duh  (okay.) okay. well that_ well then then don't imagine you singing a song imagine um um, imagine Elvis singing imagine just sort of listening to Elvis. alright and suppose you don't have any delusions right of uh, you know, or so not hav(ing to imagine) you know. some, body you have no chance of imitating like uh Barbra Streisand or someone. yeah. (xx) still. uh um, uh uh... uh okay well, all that was an aside it was kinda fun but it's just an aside the, the um, the, i wanna say both what seems weird about, (wait a minute) what seems weird about, alleged images but also um uh, uh certain kinds of, uh (xx) feelings and bodily sensations and so forth is that, is that um... is that the objects_ there see- there seem to be objects. but they seem to be, private (xx) one one, one perceiver and one modality in that perceiver. um, uh in the transparency case, which is more like normal perception case... (xx) it's usually no question of the objects you're seeing, or objects you're perceiving, can be, you can perceive in, in a number of ways and others can perceive, uh um but... um um um (xx) let me ask a ask a sorta (xx) related question oh you (xx) mhm mhm (xx) well an explosion, all around you, is just gonna be, loc- hard to locate it's gonna seem like, you're gonna be, when you try to imagine it. uh imagine especially if you imagine shards entering your body from all directions or you're imagining it all around you. (i don't know if,) it would be quite right to say, although how it might be tempting to say, that you were, visually imagining it, from all directions cuz you know your visual field doesn't, go all around your, body your head. but,  so, particularly your_ you were there in a car or something and the windshield  yeah. we- because it's a memory of a_ an episodic memory of a specific event? or...  i i i, yeah it it it might be that this, conjecture, that, uh, that monomodality captures what seems ghostly, about... alleged phenomenal objects like images, is wrong. that could be that could be said that could be that could be right. uh um, but um, um, (the,) the uh, i don't mean (it's) yet shown to be right by a particular, case like this because, um, because, um, um the question... see yeah? yeah. in the in the original car going by going zoom case i was just asking you to think about, where is the, car image where is the visual car image and where is the auditory car image and are they in the same place? that's a crude way to ask what really matters which is, does the visual does the picture of the car seem loud? um uh um does the ca- does the alleged car image seem to be making noise? uh uh uh and this this question about where they are is just proxy because if the sound is completely somewhere else it_ you know that would be good enough but even if they converge by coincidence or especially in the case where because both are big. right. right. right right.   can i just say yeah.  no no. the, when what's (cuz) regular old, perception case regular old perception case. (alright.)  right.  y- you could you can be aware that you're having the experience of green. right. right right right  in a perceptual case what this book's saying is that, the only f- when you_ when you try to introspect the normal case of perception you, only detect the two_ the following two kinds of features. um, either features that, um um seem, stuck on objects. they seem to be uh independent of your, perception and not sort of floating, in the air between you and the object you're focusing on, and they seem to be something you don't uh, you you don't create or participate in in any way. (it seems) to be ou- ou- outside, so you detect you detect those kind of, features and you detect, the property uh that you have of representing them. okay? uh and that's it. so when people say, you know when when when people say, if you, like Peacock maybe if you, if you attend to your visual experience you will notice it has certain, intrinsic features or something like that that's, what they say doesn't happen. uh the two_ maybe you (already) mentioned before the blurriness. we're not tempted to attribute the blurriness to the object. right. there was a joke once o- on David Letterman did a a, monologue joke once where he says you know uh uh this, new reports from NASA about the Hubble telescope you know say that you know what they've discovered is that space is really blurry. so, um our best telescopes confirm right. so it wasn't a waste of money. um okay the, the, yeah um so are people willing to grant that that say clarity or doubled a double image or, or blurriness that,  s- s- so what what's being represented when you when you s- s- i mean there's the  right. yeah but no i did- i didn't say you, see   okay. uh uh um y- y- i- you cross your eyes, or something and y- and uh, and and uh the watch seems to have a certain relation to you- tip of your nose be on the left of_ be on the left of your nose, and it seems to be on the right of your nose. you may pick one or one may dominate but you have these, but you, but you have these two yeah. i- i- i- and not be fooled inter- interesting case al- along that line is the the the sweatshirts, that are intentionally printed, so it looks like, it's blurred. and you_ sort of (if) you look at it and your first te- your first (attempt) is (to) sort of squint to get it right, and then you then you then you realize no it's printed, to look uh to look uh blurry. mhm he's incredibly ingenious did you did you go to his talk,  yeah cuz i mean... i don't remember all the details but, uh you have, objections from (xx) saying things like well, exactly this kind of thing can't can't_ it's, (childish) saying that Tye can't, re, capture, the apparent difference between, having a, blurry vision of a clear object and a clear image a clear vision of a blurry object or something and (Tye) said well you know i do (xx) i don't remember his (xx) but yeah that's relevant and it, and it may come up in the, i gave you a whole stack of Tye stuff last time. mhm earlier i diverted the conversations to say a little bit about, transparency and you were gonna talk about, uh image. if you wanna go back   right well, right well i'm glad it doesn't seem plausible to you but i don't know if that would be a good response. i mean... well what seems seems least plausible (xx) when you talk about uh, the loud oscilloscope, uh reading uh, uh, there i- it's when we, when we draw our attention to the oscilloscope we're not tempted to say that it itself is loud. but if we draw our attention to  right. yeah (that's) so, that's why, i think, what's going on is really, an illusion case. mkay. i um  uh, um... it's not built into the notion of illusion that it's phenomenal. no uh uh uh um um all i i- and i don't_ actually you don't, even care whether the appearance is false and uh that's for the larger aim of arguing for, inner perception you're gonna need inner perception even if there really are red images, uh in your head. um you wouldn't be able to see them so you'd hafta ( have inner) but um um, but uh, and there's also some funny stuff about calling it an illusion rather than a hallucination properly speaking it's_ these are hallucinations, on the same view it's not that there's, it's not like where where the hallucination, like an oasis case there's nothing there dominantly responsible for the experience right  oh oh um um, uh... i i, i'm happy to say there could be subliminal illusions uh uh uh um or that a robot can suffer from illusion i mean i- i- i- if there was a robot or a pigeon or something that some_ suppose we somehow knew it didn't have, phenomenal consciousness. it could still be under an illusion that there- the Mueller Lire illusion and so forth. uh uh uh or so in one sense of it being being under an illusion is  but part again there there there are illusions, i mean part of what's, okay if illusion can sometimes be used (to mean) (xx) you're you're mistaken you thought something was the case but it wasn't the case, um, but um there is another sense of what i- visual illusion. something seems to you to be, something or to be some way it's not in fact. um, the, the usual way (in which) you talk about that is the things out there aren't the way in which they seem to us. you think you see water and it's in fact, the the the heat rising off the the desert that gives this, uh illusion to you of of water. there's something outside which is giving giving rise to it but you're, you're you're misinterpreting it. um but in that case you still have the the phenomenal_ there's a phenomenal experience. yeah yeah   yeah (right) suppose (xx) apart from whether or not you can have non-phenon- nonphenomenal uh, sorta perceptual, uh when when i think of the uh, uh uh i imagine a red fire truck or a red object a red ball or something like that um, uh the, to say that it's an illusion that it's red, um uh, the... i mean regardless of whether there's anything red it's not a matter of my, being wrong about whether there was something red. if i thought there was something red in my head that would be an illusion in the, in the sort of objective reference, sense. but to say, it didn't_ it wasn't, really red it just seemed red, seems to be a- an impossible turn of speech. that, if it if it seems red than it seems red and i may be mistaken about, uh it referring to anything. but, if it i- at least there's a there's a a prima facie uh i think needs to be overthrown that in fact uh when you seem to uh have an ex- an inner experience of uh a red image a red ball, uh if it seems red, the the phenomenal part of it, isn't just an illusion. i mean you really did have, in other words you you're not mistaken that you did have that phenomenal experience. uh you're mistaken if you thought that it applied some objective, object out there that actually had, the the property of being red such that someone looked at it, uh they would see something red. um i didn't follow all that are you saying there's a certain, um common sense view that you you you are daring to argue out of? okay i accept the dare. what's the, i i i i imagine i'll i'll stick with this this example for a while the claim is just mhm i say you don't have this_ i i i i don't put it like that i would say cuz cuz uh uh y- that wouldn't be an image illusion. to say that, um, it's true that you have an experience of a red ball. okay in thinking of red image there we're talking about image in terms of a physical image? or, uh a mental yeah. yeah.  the point of this is the point of this is yeah uh uh i i i'm i'm gonna say there's no such thing as, mental images there's no such thing as, mental likenesses generally so there's no, uh pain objects that are sharp, you know and and that are are burning or throbbing, there are no, orgasms, there are no um, sounds uh mental sounds uh uh um i- j- but there are, states, that say there are, those things. uh uh uh those kind of objects it it feels to you like there's a pain in your tooth. it feels to you it seems to you it looks to you (really) like there's an image in your mind. duh duh duh duh. when you really are in those states of, misrepresenting that there are these, mental likenesses.   i agree there's this initial appearance and then i would say it lasts until you die. you know you wanna say i guess you can get rid of it. i don't think you get rid of it by thinking about it and i d- y- i don't think you get r- i don't think you get rid of that appearance, by but  maybe it's flat or something (right) yeah (mkay) i- i- i- i'm not saying much different than what Smart is saying about the images. the the uh i, i didn't underst- i heard and underst- i think i understood, your, where you started saying (like) i'm not, and maybe you said much i don't remember i'm not much tempted to, think that was your word, that there's a red picture. yeah i'm not at all. uhuh uhuh uhuh physical images of some sort. physical what are you calling a physical i_  no  right okay right.   yeah the the subjective state is real  it does seem that there is a uh uh a reality to the subjective experience that i have. that means it does seem that the experience exists. the experience exists  all i wanna know is does the experience seem red? does the experience seem red. all you've told me so far about this experience is that it exists. does it seem to have any other features? like having a color?  but if you say it's an experience of s- red you gotta suppose it's an experience of a red patch or something. i mean you don't have to suppose that there really is a patch but it's but all i want is that you got an experience, and according to that experience there is something red.  even yeah that's all i'm saying. but there's nothing red there really so it's an illusion. well there's nothing physically red. i don't understand nonphysically red what do you mean physically red.  um um what's the conclusion? again? or the conclusion is that the the fact that, it seems a certain way sort of Thomas Nagel's uh there's a fact of subjective experience which is a, fact about the real world and how we incorporate it into, uh into our metaphysical scheme. uh that's another question but he contends and it it seems undeniable to me that there are facts of subjective experience that i have a the the there's a fact about my experience that it seems to be of a red, sphere when i form the image. okay i don't know what you're_ if that's your conclusion we we_ if that if that really is your conclusion we don't disagree, because all i'm saying is, uhuh (is)    it seems to you like there's something red that's the same. so far. uh the which seems to pick out something else. which then has it.  it's a property of my experience it's not a property,    okay. uh uh uh um i, i d- i don't even know what a phenomenal property is i'm talking about redness shape if if if redness is is confusing here talk about curvature. um two claims. uh well there is there are things curved in my head but_ m- my brains and   here here? they're_ these are both judgments, these are both these are both just propositions right but this state you're asking (isn't this) a judgment? i i'm neutral i don't care it was whatever, it it's that thing you were calling experience. okay right okay alright i think i'm very much inclined to say that there is something straight in my mind. alright alright   well then where is this thing that's straight. is, isn't what's behind that, some kind of a property-sharing view of representation? (that) you got it right so you have genuine properties of of of of,      part part part of the (xx) when you say nothing straight in my head uh uh the, when you have a a say a curved wire and you twist it around so you can't see the curvature, it will look straight.   and i would wanna say that when i c- when i when i turn the curved wire so that i can't see the the bend in it, mhm  well it's not really an image of a straight thing cuz i know that if i turn it it's not really straight. an image as of    what does phenomenally straight mean? it looks straight. the image looks straight. that's just to say this. i g- now now you're back you've come down here. to say, you're confusing something being straight with something being represented as straight.  yeah?     yeah what what's confus- what's unintelligible to me is uhuh yeah i didn't say it seems to you like you imagine a straight  yeah you don't think you could be mistaken about that, is what you're saying. it seems to me that there is a a prima facie, uh uh uh claim, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   an image  saying that there is wh- when i when i uh imagine a straight, when i have a straight line in my head. okay    alright  yeah now X i just did as a shorthand but i, i, we  i just meant X to mean something is straight. but it's actually true that something is straight in the universe i mean, that i am exp- that... uh uh uh and and uh, but roughly i mean that you know that uh, i, have an image in h- you know in here that is straight. that's what i really mean for X. so i have a visual internal state, affirming i have an image,  or that there is some straight in here. yeah i- i- i- i- it, the i is probably also misleading it should be you know, uh an image is straight or something like that. okay so there is a state, which, uh uh is affirming that there is, a straight image. yeah that's what i think's going on even when there is no straight image. yeah and it seems that what's happened there is that the phenomena has the phenomenal, uh feel one might say has dropped out. well that's your theory but i'm gonna claim that this explains phenomenal. uh uh uh um (i'm sorry) if you think see, if you think that this has to be, tru- tell me whe- at what poi- um i'm gonna point to things you tell me at what point has the, has_ have i denied that there's phenomenality. here? it can't be that already right here i've denied that, there's phenome-  all i've said is that there is a state there could be an- there could be any number of other things, in addition. let let's start here. certainly this claim is compatible, with there being phenomenal consciousness. i'm imagining straightness that that doesn't deny yet. add this claim. it just says a little more about this it doesn't say what there isn't, it's down here where i s- or up here where i say where, wh- that there isn't something. so if you're gonna say that it's this part this denial of this that says, cuz see this pa- this claim here doesn't say that this state is false or anything. it's this part that together with this says the state is false. so now wh- when i'm down here i'm starting to deny stuff. if you think that this, denial means denying that there's phenomenality then you're thinking that phenomenality requires images with these kind of features. and you're_ and then s- so there's your arg- you can do a_ you can write your own book other than Chalmer- like to the same effect as Chalmers and get, from taking phenomenal consciousness seriously straight to dualism. yeah it's it's the there is a_ there is a visual internal state... that affirms a proposition inste- the proposition, uh it doesn't gonna have any phenomenal quality in that brackets is there? or does it get snuck in in the brackets that you have, visual state affirms, (xx) okay yeah but the state doesn't deny that there's something it just says there's this.  no but i can i can say affirm that there is a uh red spherical ball, and uh do it quickly enough or in a way in which i don't form an image, of a red spherical ball. and it seems as though all that statement is saying is there's an internal state that's affirming, the proposition of a red spherical ball, which doesn't seem to include, the phenomenal character of what in fact is going on and what i'm imagining. okay i i i i hear that claim. uhuh right right  yeah  this state says something is straight in my brain or mind or soul or body.  yeah and you you're suggesting that that constitutes phenomenality. i haven't argued for that yet, right  what? where? where? (this) one this is shape this means shape man. uh uh um and i know nothing_ i- o- if we we could we could we could, i can demonstrate some straight things to you but i'm not making a distinction between phenomenal and nonphenomenal physical and nonphysical straightness. straight means you know, an edge that lies along the shortest path between two points and so forth you know. um that's one thing yeah i- i- i- (an extent)  okay then then, give me my words straight if you want me to choose a different noise for that feature i will. all i care about is that it seems to you like there's something with that feature. but there's nothing with that feature. if you wanna, take every word i use and give it a second meaning and deny the claims in those other meanings fine but y- then we're not arguing. uh uh uh um okay? so, so um um i mean that was sorta the whole point of trying to do_ go to this, to stick with shape was that it was something we could, hold fixed if you switch to color then you're swapping between too easily betwe- reflectance and disposition and you know th- it's up in the air what the word red means what sh- part of the world it carves. that's why i wanna stick w- part of why i wanted to stick with shape talk. um and and yeah yeah absolutely i mean these two words to mean the same thing in the two claims. so you know there's another word i mean if i'm gay then you know there's some- if i'm if i'm i'm sorry if i'm heterosexual then there's something you know straight about me but that's just a pun right? and in the same way some kind of phenomenal straightness or whatever you wanna say is also just a pun... well pa- pa- part of what makes it makes it hard to to say that there's something straight is that is that straight it's it's it's, it's a boundary to some area uh uh so you (measure) black and white with a straight sort of line between so you go from from one to the next or y- you can imagine sort of a black line in a white space uh uh those those kinds of things. uh uh, but if you try to have straight just by itself i mean it have to has_ you have to ha- have some width to the line to be able to imagine it so it's... that's alright but, uhuh  yeah when i when i have_ when i when i imagine_ close my eyes and imagine a black line uh with some red to it okay? the entire but did you mean th- th- that it captures or you want it to capture in any way, the phenomenal? no no no no right so  yeah yeah. yeah yeah. if you could, w- w- rewind just a couple sentences? okay    no no no that's not that's not it? that's not that's not a problem. any thing is a thing. no now you're really reaching cuz it_ see the the the okay if a if if if if a mental picture or a m- mental image is a thing   okay when i close my eyes uhuh  uhuh you create an object which is a mental, picture. you create  and now tell me_ now what more can you tell me about this mental picture. like can you tell me where it is? can you tell me what it's made out of? no it's not it's not a thing in the world it it's a it's now is your mind something in the world or is your mind somewhere else? yeah my mind is in the world. your mind's in the world and th- and this thing is in your mind but this thing is not in the world. no the the the thing the thing the thing is in the world and it's being in my mind but it's it's it_ what one one needs i think one one needs to, uh needs to uh, what i wa- wanna say is that the the mind-slash-brain is able to generate mental images which have a reality to them. which are  physical world? okay okay, mhm you you you are_ okay so when you say the word w- when you say the word world, or when you say the word thing or something you tell me if you are meaning just whatever you're meaning by the physical world or physical thing. um or say explicitly physical world physical thing. okay and now, i got_ i kinda understand you to be saying, see before you want to say the mental picture, you say sometimes it has a reality to it i don't know how to understand that other than, it exists. uh uh um but if you mean something different, (xx) yeah, yeah. no i wanna say it exists in the world but i wanna say that it's not a physically existent thing namely something that  right right  no   the content of it... includes a straight_ s- something straight yes. the content of it includes something     right right yes. we- literally, uh yes it- it's it is straight. it is straight. okay.  there you wanna know where in terms of the space.  uhuh  right. okay so so that's why in this case they_ because you, it's because you believe they're straight that you believe, the word straight a- correctly applies, okay. so so now Peter we're at this point where you wanna say, uh there's these mental-picture parts, that are straight in the spatial sense, s- th- that is  oh okay alright. uh uh um but now, um analogies are cheap. so you know uh uh there are plenty mental analogues of space are all of them gonna be, susceptible in terms of straight curved and so forth? all_ anything that's analogous in any sense to space? yeah yeah  it's straight it's w- no no  mental space is not some extra-physical space that's not in,  most of it_ i i i'm not offering that either i'm saying w- i would say there could be, there could be multiple spaces that aren't spatially related to one another. that would be fine i can even imagine that. uh uh uh um so so whereas a fold would be at a particular point of place, a- and not elsewhere it would be spatially related to the nonfolded part but, if if what you you_ take your pick you can have it i'll give you this much, if you wanna say there's, that all this is a demonstration from you know from this from the intuit- from introspection that you know there must be a uh an extra, realm of, space that's, if if if this is the way you wanna go not, neither here nor there, yeah it s- seems that you you're  oh i no i don't resist the idea that there is this mental analogue i insist that there are just way too many mental analogues you know uh uh um so i mean any three-dimensional if you're talking about three-dimensional space any three-dimensional, mental, any three mental dimensions so you know how much i love someone how much how how how uh how confident i am in their in in in their, you know in their reliability you know how how much i think they owe me you know will be analogous to physical space. not very analogous.   because i don't wanna create some sort of mystery space there that's off in some then then then then, do you wa- but you do wanna create straightness there and not  yeah   i understand that that's why you're complaining bu- bu- that that's, that that's why you're complaining but that complaint is really misplaced because i wasn't at this state of the argument, trying to say, if you have and in fact i don't believe, that i would that if this is true, there is consciousness. i'm i- i- i- i wasn't trying to say that all i was trying to establish was we have a certain illusion. and it seems that you could grant that. uh uh uh cuz i'm not saying you know, consciousness is an illusion yeah yeah yeah no i know you're_ what you wanna a- ad- add some stuff by you know the the the the paper we were looking at last time the add enough things into it then none of the parts have any phenomenal character when you put 'em all together right uhuh uhuh uhuh okay you're objecting to uh   it's alright i just have  go ahead oh   thanks yeah just yeah   okay okay see ya right uhhh um okay i offered to give you the last word... no well    well, right   yeah i think that that's you know uh uh what are you holding out for?  it's bizarre for me to be reaching for some physical th- phy- physical uh uh line in my head yeah and i'd i would say it's bizarre to be claiming to (be) reaching for something straight or n- almost straight,  in your sou- yeah in your soul but i'm not gonna say soul, it could make myself into a dualism but in my experience. in your mind yeah. in my mind. and you_ but you want there to be s- i mean you would like it you'd be happy  if if if i can be given if i can be given a uh uh an account of it, in nonphenomenal terms s- sort of the the the     namely? the, the, the character of my experience was, uh now characters can be straight. character_ wh- not the character in a personal sense like the was the experience straight? you've only told me it's a_ you've t- there's a page there's a mark on the page there's you there's an experience. you haven't  your experience had a straight part? right.   uhuh wow in a conscious way. more and more bizarre. yeah yeah my experience has a m- m- my my experience poof.    right right yeah yeah yeah the the strange thing about to say the experience is straight is usually when we talk about the experience we've stepped back from it, and we're talking uh sort of uh uh secondhand about uh, uh something that's going on in someone else's mind. and there   this part of the experience l- l- n- i i don't understand quite part of exp- what that means you'd hafta tell me but, one guess is i- sometimes i have complex experiences and i have experiences as parts of those complex experiences so i i experienced the Gulf War, part of it was experiencing you know landing in Kuwait or  uhuh so can we just dispense with, shouldn't we just talk about the visual field? you said your visual field part of your visual field was straight? is that better you'd rather go that way? pa- i wanna say part of the the the content_ well it's not m- my my visual field, cuz when i'm having an experience i'm not having a a_ i mean there is there is this sense in which it is like the the visual field i'm looking at the piece of paper i don't have uh imagine a three-hundred-sixty degree uh, uh so that there there there're constraints, put on it you you you're telling my part of an experience is straight. you liken that to something i (am) equally befuddled by yeah i a line. either a line or how- yeah well no, there it's it's analogous to the kind of characteristics of when something uh uh looking something in a salient and it and it and it's and it's far away. uh   that my mind could extend? uh i d- i d- why you would find that silly but not the earlier stuff silly i i haven't yeah it's because it's because whenever i think of the spatial characteristics of of my uh uh of my, uh image, it's not_ there's not literal uh uh spatial in the images it's not it's not but straightness is a literal spatial property, what are you saying? i'm saying that the experience that i have uh when i'm imagining is the same experience i have when i'm looking at the line on the the piece of paper and that the uh, i'm enough of a physicalist to think that what's taking place is really taking place in my brain and that somehow i project, and through some projection have this this, this sense that the line is out there when i'm looking at the line on the piece of paper. but you're not enough of a physicalist to, to conc- you're let- you let beliefs you have about the brain, talk you out of the idea that if you've ever (were attended) to it, that part of your experience is far away. but you don't let facts_ beliefs you have about the brain, talk you out of the idea that part of experience is say straight. or purple. or, polka-dotted or whatever. but you make this decision. that the brain is equally_ i- the brain is as un-polka-dotted and as unstraight as it is un-far-away. yeah, right. well their not right if that's what's at the root of all this then i, really suggest you, consider uh trying to find a way to believe in qualia without believing that straightness has to be a (qualae.) that's a good challenge to end on i think. alright, alright... yeah yeah i mean i believe in qualia but i think they are features other than, distance away straightness reflectance and so forth they're just some other features. uh, uh, okay. whoo.  yeah mhm    well it's not c- cr- (xx) not only logic there's also the empirical, bad luck that there's nothing straight in the brain. you coulda lucked out. eh if there were straight things in my brain that wouldn't help me.  yeah so it's, it's (just) mysterious why that would be at all tempting to, to go that way. when i think about what actually goes on in my brain i- it seems to me that that uh uh, uh it's conceivable we could be recording the information in our brain in zeros and ones or (xx) not really but,  mhm  uh i have to- t- represents is w- we'll wrestle  yeah yeah yeah you want something in-between representing straightness and having straightness. yeah actually i'm i- enough of of what Searle says about information and ref- re- referring, uh that i'm not sure something really ref- one thing refers to another, um uh without there being some, uh referring for a subject or bringing in in in the \",\n",
       "       \"Hall's talk today, i put a sign up on the old room, and so some of you i hope got to hear it, or at least part of it it was still going along when i left so, i (had to) sort of sneak out. alright. we'll come back we may talk about, the acta- African Burial Grounds in New York later on in the course there are all sorts of, really interesting, things associated with the social and political things associated with it, also the_ Professor Hall didn't get a chance to talk about but we will be discussing things later on. i wanna start off today, just to say a couple of words simply because some of you have talked to me, about stuff that you're feeling confused with, and things that you feel a little uncomfortable about, (i wanna talk) for a minute about historicism, and for those of you who are anthropologists, or cultural anthropologists for sure, it won't be difficult for you to, relate to this. because the concept of cultural relativism, is, an extremely important thing in anthropology. this is the idea that when you study another culture, or when you are exposed to another culture, or simply to understand another culture, you need to understand it, from the perspective of that culture itself. you can't understand how somebody thinks, in ano- in another society in another culture without understanding the context of that thought. the same thing applies to history. the same thing applies to the history of racism, and it applies to the history of science. so when we look at people in the past now a large part of this class is looking at the history of science and the history of racism. you have to remember, to try to put yourself into the context, in which these people were living and thinking. they come from a different place and a different time. so sometimes virtually everybody that we'll be looking at historically, by the standards of today would be considered a racist. but in the context of their time, some were and some were not. and these are things that we need to consider. another thing you have to think about also and i think that for some of you guys, you might not be thinking about this because you don't think historically. um, in terms of biology, one of the th- you have to think of the relationship_ think about the way that people were thinking, in biology, a hundred years ago. a lot of the things that we take for granted, in terms of our understandings of genetics, our understandings of the relationships between genetics and evolution, are incredibly recent discoveries. very very very recent. realize that Gregor Mendel, who we talked about, was writing, in the, later nineteenth century. he was ar- his work was around at the same time as Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin never knew it. you know why? because, Gregor Mendel was Czech. and he was writing in German. and there was an enormous amount of, of um, almost not really nationalism but a certain amount of ethnocentrism, in science which exists today. There th- the work in some countries is not paid as much attention to, as the work in other countries. and Darwin and other English workers, were not really paying much attention to what was going on in the German world. and in the German literature. so this is something, to think about also nobody, was reading Mendel. very few people paid any attention to him at all and it wasn't really until, this century or not this century, the one we just left, the nineteenth, the the twentieth century, that people started to pay attention to genetics at all. and it really, Mendelian genetics really took off in the nineteen twenties. but what did people know about genes then? genes were, theories. no one saw a gene. no one knew what a gene looked like, nobody knew what D-N-A was. when did, when did Watson and Crick live? anybody know? fifties. in the fifties. when was it really established and when was it really permeating, the academic communities? in the sixties. when did people act- when were people actually able, to sequence D-N-A? the last fifteen years. fifteen twenty years we're looking at really recent stuff. and for a large portion of, the history of biology, a lot of things, were based on inference which is fine because, that's really how most science is done. many of the things that we consider to be scientific facts, are actually theories and we will talk about that, in the beginning of next week. but in terms of genetic observations these are incredibly recent things and th- y- you need to keep these things in mind, when we talk about the history of the field and when we talk about things that seem, so crazy and strange, when we talk about them in the past, we need to keep in mind, that these are based on the knowledge that was available at the time and they actually made a lot of sense. they weren't silly things, necessarily. but they weren't particularly silly things there are things we need to keep in mind in terms of the history, of anthr- of of biology. so for much of the history of biology genes, were not observed. that's a very very recent thing. and that's added to our knowledge enormously. so what are the big questions? the big questions, that people had, from the very beginning of biology, are still being asked today. and i sort of jotted down what are some of these big questions? what are, how does the body know how to develop? how does the body_ how come all humans develop the same way? how does the body know how to develop? those were big questions then. how are traits transmitted? and we we know an awful lot about transmission genetics. how does the body know how to develop that first question? that is ontogeny, the idea that we were talking about last time. ontogeny is the development of the individual. and the study of that development is called ontogeny. actually let me just put up where we were last time... (xx) just leave it there (for me) better what's the difference in the geologic time (scales?) i'm sorry? how how much difference in time scales (is there?) in time scale? between the, punctuated equilibrium oh. the time scale doesn't hafta really vary that much at all. the idea is, basically, here the idea is that the branch- that the process between form A and form B is a gradual one. it's just an accumulation of changes. what he would argue here, is that the process of transformation, is very fast. and it depends on the species. w- but, in the case of something with long generations like us it could be, you know within maybe even a hundred thousand years. which is a drop in the bucket when we think about, when we think about big time. which, is a different, way of thinking about time. but we'll get into (it) in (on that) another_ which we'll get into in another time. that when we think about, evolutionary time and geological time, with long lived organisms like we are, we're really looking, at what seems to us, a very very long long long period of time. but, in terms of the history of the earth and in terms of the history of our species, they're actually rather short periods of time. so, yeah? so punctuated equilibrium requires like a, massive dying off, (the) that's how they would explain that, exactly. that there would be a dying off of species A. it_ i'll come back to this in a second when we talk about speciation models, because it really is derived, from a model of Ernst Mayr, called, that he talks about s- i suspect in that article, i get those articles mu- muddled up, called peripatric speciation. and this is generally, agreed it's most most people agree that this is how speciation generally occurs. when one species splits into two... imagine you have a species, not like humans cuz humans are weird because we live everywhere. but imagine you have a species that lives happily in some, location. in some general area. and there are lots and lots of populations all these little circles are populations, (xx) they can't interbreed? they can't interbreed exactly. because they really are, essential categories. the ways that most people define species these days, is based on interfertility. members of a species can interbreed. and members of a, separate species cannot. and so that's why species, probably of all the taxomonic te- taxonomic categories, really, is in a sense a very typological thing so it really conforms, to the mindset, of, people in the field... but all of the categories, were treated, all of Linneas's categories were treated, in the same way that species were. they were types. they couldn't be transcended. they were fixed types. that he had described that were a part of nature. that couldn't be transcended. and the species was almost always the foremost and most, strong of these things. after Darwin there was an attempt to evolutionize the taxonomy. what were these taxonomies based on? (think about this) Linneas based it on morphology right? he based it on how things looked. things that looked more similar, were things that had similar embryologies, were things that, resembled each other he thought, should be grouped into the same group so if he was looking for a number of species, to put into a genus, he did it basically based on what they looked like. and what people have tried to do since, Darwin since Darwin, is try to evolutionize the taxonomies that Linneas created. sometimes it works. because morphology, peop- animals tend to look a lot alike if they're more closely related to each other. so often these taxonomies, really do reflect evolutionary relationships. but sometimes they don't... sometimes they don't. it was want- people_ when you evolutionize taxonomy you want to have taxonomy represent phylogeny. okay? you want the taxonomy to represent evolutionary relationships. let me give you an example of how it doesn't work. sometimes. perfect example is us, as human beings... we're traditionally considered to be a part of a superfamily, called the hominoidea. right. the hominoidea is a superfamily, this is a great example. i was just wondering if the classification of superfamily comes before or after family? it comes above family. so after  it doesn't set us apart pardon? it doesn't set us  oops how do you determine the structure of the cladogram? like    mm no (xx) my question is, who determines that, there was one shoot here and then two_ re- regardless of who you f- finally assign those groups  oh just why is it determined like a triangle like that? yeah or however you wanna, however you wanna visualize it. well because wheth- it's always m- it uh it's always basically no matter how big your cladogram becomes, at its core it is always resolved in trichotomies. so there's always three. so two have to be closer together than a third, and this is just how it's drawn out as a convention. so what you're doing is sh- showing the relationship of two things here, and a more distant one there. the idea being that this would be the dif- the common ancestor, of these two, right? and then this would be, the common ancestor of all three. does this make sense...? cuz you're looking at three and you're really looking at the, you're looking at the um, at the, just at at_ you're really trying to just it's just a relative thing, which of the two are more closely related to the third. time is not an issue on a cladogram. but would the possibility for instance that, all three of them diverged at the same time? like (if)  that, that has a lot to do with how, Mayr talks about how mhm right... and, the other thing also is to- because_ and you gotta think about it also in terms of monophyletic groups. let's talk about monophyletic groups so we can come back to this again. because, if there's a triple branch, there's not_ we're not gonna have monophyly. and and let's, talk about this in just a second. a monophyletic group is an ancestor of all its descendents right? so down here this all this whole thing could be considered, if this is all the descendents. if these are all the descendents that are possible, this down here, could be considered mono- the whole f- cluster could be a monophyletic group. because there would be the ancestor and here are all the descendents. this actually isn't because there're actually other descendents as well. but, in certain certainly in circumstances it could. each branch though here, is a monophyletic group you have the ancestor of all the orangutans not at the node but just beyond the node, basically (here,) of al- this ancestor and all its descendents, all orangutans all_ everything along this clade, is a result of this one ancestor. this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor and all of its descendents. and this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor of all of its descendents. and so all of these, sticks, are considered to be monophyletic groups and for cladistics to work, they need to be monophyletic groups. Rachel hm sure, yeah? i have a question of what uh, what would a non-monophyletic group look like? a non-monophyletic group_ let's_ okay... it's assumed for instance that all of these higher categories are not monophyletic. recently, it's been argued, that in fact, reptiles are not monophyletic. because, these are all_ reptiles are, a class, and so are birds, and so for that, you you would expect that a mon- monophyletic group would include an ancestor and all of its descendents. but birds, are among the an- are the among the descendents of reptiles. it's now pretty well understood that birds evolved from reptiles. and so that if you had the ancestor of all reptiles, you would have to include birds as well within it. if you include all its descendents. and so reptiles now would not be considered a monophyletic group. therefore that taxonomy, is not a good evolutionary taxonomy, according to these systematics. birds however, within the reptiles, would be a monophyletic group. and so it would be a single ancestor of all the birds, and then all its descendents. another example of a non-monophyletic group would be if there were multiple, would be some hypotheses that we'll be talking about in terms of race. all the polygenic theories, of race would be non-monophyletic theories. because then you'd have multiple ancestors, and multiple descendents. s- any category below the species level, in addition, is not a monophyletic group. certainly in humans, it is not a monophyletic group. there is no such thing, as a pure race (okay) and that's what (it would) imply. but a lot of people model races, as monophyletic groups and we'll be coming to that. there's no such thing, as an ancestor of all, members of a single race, and all it's descendents. because there's gene flow, between members of different racial groups. yeah? i mean an- (xx) so that would be another example of a non-monophyletic group. so if races are treated like this, and this is what we'll be coming to, if races are treated like this, it's an inappropriate application, of cladistics, because races are not monophyletic. there's gene flow between, the branches. and it's probably not fair to even model races this way as branches at all. because whenever you're modeling things as branches, you're assuming, monophyly. an ancestor and all its descendents... okay. the steps of cladistics i was s- what time is it? oh we've got time. um no \"],\n",
