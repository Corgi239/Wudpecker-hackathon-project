       "       \"okay you feel th- as though you're in a lab or,  (i don't know) mm, it wasn't too much it didn't take me too long to just, use the same word i just, i'd say the hardest part yeah was changing the sentences. trying to make 'em all fit again. okay okay. but the rhythm seemed to work right and, mhm     okay. now, part of part of what you need to do is to look back at the beginning of this and say, w- how are you using the word elegy? and how can poetry be a   i was figuring i mean, it's a form of it cuz i mean it represents it, because it is, i mean it's not a short story it's not a novel, right mkay, but but again if by definition an elegy is a kind of poem, then it can't then poetry can't be a   mkay oh okay where's that?    mhm mhm because the while would make it, need more, (kind of, the) okay the wh- the while makes it dependent. yeah just poetry (xx) again huh? right. now th- that's perfectly alright. because, because what you've done is to make this dependent this part, is is dependent and the comma here makes a difference, but, when you say while poems are used to release this pain, they can also be used for paying respect to the dead. um, you can you can imagine, some people work uh, with the principle that's called sentence combining. when they want to when they want to get students to learn how to, to get variety into their, language and into their sentences they do sentence combining which will, give them the opportunity to reshape sentences almost endlessly. and so you could reshape this one but this is a this is a fine sentence because, you've you've said while this is true, this is also true. um, that's that's not a difficult (xx) mhm  mhm mm  it's just um, taken away not as much emphasized on, if the reader could really make uh, i mean if the writer could really make the reader feel what they saying. okay, uh can you think of another way of saying that? can you think of another word, a single word that would do that? taken away by the writer's ability t- okay taken away by  mm, hmm,   okay yeah okay mm, because i, i took it as_ i mean he was using, just grass but, it was mainly about horses and i figure horses eat the grass so, mhm but but what do you mean by connotation...?  mhm yeah i mean that's what i was thinking a implied meaning right? mhm  mhm, okay hm? from grass? i didn't get that. okay,  i mainly just got the animals eat the grass, that's what i was thinking so, okay okay. okay. um... and here where, where you're talking about the simile and you see that as the major figure, then i would, then i would put the quotation in there and, okay   mkay yeah, that's fine. i mean that that really does break that down otherwise it'd just_ so that if you if you put the colon in there, and say this is what i mean by what i've just said. it just sharpens it. it gets you, it seems like there's a point. whereas the sentence that you had before just drags on. and we can't really see where the where the point is is coming. um  what um, what (xx) do you need? right. uh, or he's given a scenario that doesn't require much, in, in the way of, extensive analysis. i mean jus- get it that that short. because that's the point that, that you're making. okay. i think when i be, trying to stretch the paper, uhuh oh okay right, right. and the way_ it seems to me that that the one thing that this paper lacks, that where you could've lengthened it without any kind of padding at all, would would have been through the use of quotations. that there're there're places here where, i'm sort of looking for the example you've given me the general description,  okay. is that is that helpful at all? (xx) yeah concrete detail. out of the text pretty much huh? right and and then just, that that, connection between, poetry and THE elegy or the relation between poetry and elegiac poetry, is the one that just needs to be clear, all the way all the way through. mkay okay  mhm. yeah. this must of been the hardest i worked on a paper, in a while. is it? yeah  good. mhm. English two-thirty-nine, we had like a ten page paper i got a B-plus on it. in Chinese we had about a six page paper i got a, B-plus A-minus. okay so, mm,  mhm   okay. yeah because i don't think i don't think i'm coming down, terribly hard on this paper, uh and in fact i'm worrying about myself that i'm that i'm being too lenient a grader mm      yeah i think it would help. okay a review session. okay. alright, well... work away and uh, we'll see how how things go on the final. but i but i just wanted to, let you know in a more explicit way what i was, troubled with here, and why i wasn't, why the grade wasn't, maybe where you would want it to be. okay, what i could try this again? if you'd like that'd be great. okay    okay okay. good. would you have um, any suggestion on how i can make this better? mhm right... and you were reading this, back in this section on sounds? um, yep... same type of thing. (mm) i think i can find it this way. mhm   okay wonderful. thanks for having me. should we listen to ourselves? okay. (xx) okay, uh, the paper that i redid was the self-analysis, right right and this is the, that's the    the one that you_ that i turned back the other day. that that's it right here. okay how 'bout the one on,  the elegy. was that the most recent paper? mhm okay good. yeah okay. um you mean from like high school? no,  well where did you go to high school? i went to uh_ are you familiar with the area? mhm okay   who was the instructor? the instruc- it was a G-S-I uh i, don't remember her name. she was, Romanian i don't know if that really rings a bell. i don't know. no yeah i didn't think it would but uh, it was a it was like a night class so like uh it was it was_ i just liked it it was a good class. and then uh, i needed to take uh, like in my requirement for art and design you need to take six credits of English. so right now i'm taking American Lit Intro to American Lit, and Intro to Poetry. okay  and how are you doing in that other course? uh  okay okay  uh it's uh, it's um, Boeching or how do you s- Beechum Beechum that's it. okay okay. alright and in this class, things aren't going quite that well. right, yeah,  okay okay   i think that's true. i i also wonder, because i don't usually work with a text like this so this is a bit of a surprise to me  mhm  right yeah     okay yeah right to make sense  right i i i'm i'm  right you'd more or less  okay. one of the great helps of understanding, Acquainted with the Night was, the time we spent discussing symbolism. uhuh  yeah, do you sure and almost anytime you do that you you're going to be less clear than     mkay    okay right mhm   mhm yeah. i could've easily just said the rhyme scheme_ are you talking about this one right here? mhm okay.  get that out of there right right. you could put due to her um, yeah avoid due to   okay most of, someone once, pointed out that that almost all of Emily Dickinson's poems can be, um, can be, uh sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas. that that the rhyme scheme is is does duplicate itself so much, that that you could just, sing it to that tu- sing all of them to that tune. um, okay um, it, it's not logical to say that something is both unique and almost nonexistent. uh right? when you_ if if it's unique we're going to remark on it and it's gonna be significant enough that it clearly is gonna have, an existe- if you look if you look at her rhyme scheme, it is pretty regular,     mhm  oh yeah i i understand. okay well, i wouldn't i wouldn't mind your sharpening, the Dickinson and Hopkins and maybe rather than redo it i'd, i'm not a, uh i think that much of the time when we ask students to go back and and do something over again um, they would be better off moving forward. mhm  mkay    yeah, that  nice.    okay. yeah. what time is it? how are you coming with that Larkin poem?    we'll see where where we  i think it's a_ the first time i heard that poem i heard a friend of mine read it, in a in a reading that i had arranged at the uh, at the A-P,     uhuh  it's it's a, it's an unusual move and you don't know whether he's trying to, to finesse the whole question   no i no i i actually found uh, i found a ton of poetry online from him. okay right no (well i) he's pretty direct in, (yeah)    no he's talking to you, yeah yeah you can definitely make some sense out of it so good thanks  get yourself a drink of water before you so the um, just just to remind_ like the the final is the twenty-fifth right? right okay just i think in the afternoon  good so what are we gonna talk about? i was hoping maybe um we could talk about, maybe you said you might have those sheets ready today? oh that's right and you're not gonna be here. i'm not gonna be here on um, on Tuesday i'm going to Florida. okay  yeah. okay, if you go_  prank call. i hope they're not starting to solicit here i mean i get enough of those at home. three-seventy-two (next page,) it's down at the bottom of the page. doo doo doo, sonnet_ which one? seventy-three. mkay. three-eighty-seven To His Coy Mistress, which we haven't read.

Among Schoolchildren page four-thirty-three. it's the top of the next page. mm mm two-seventy-nine. Dov- i'm gonna answer this one more time Dover Beach on two-twenty-five. two-twenty-five  i need to get a new pen. here's one thank you um, i'll ask you to respond to some some short questions. um they may be questions drawn from the the textbook part of Western Wind, uh where i where i might say, identify, um the synecdoche in the following lines. uh, identify um, the the the guiding metaphor in this stanza. identify some other kind of poetic feature um, where i'm just asking you to, to demonstrate to me that you've got something like a critical vocabulary that you've picked up during the course (of things.) those aren't aren't usually very uh, very difficult. uh, i might even give you some lines, of poetry and ask you to identify them. but i wouldn't i wouldn't ask you to identify them ju- with no context. and the context might be, match, the following line, from the poem from which it's taken. or here are some here are some cl- here are the closing lines of five poems and, wh- match them with poems in the column to the right. where you just have to do some some recall. that's not a difficult part of what we do and it's it's not really central to to this. then i probably would would give you um, one or two short essays, that will be based on, either the poems that that we've read here or, one of those poems set over against a poem that you haven't seen, seen before. uh i might i might say, um, here's a poem by Hopkins that you haven't that you haven't seen before what are the qualities that you find in this poem that are also apparent in The Windhover? which is one of the poems i'll have asked you to review. so that so that you might have some things ready to say about almost any poem that we've we've done. then my typical, final question is an hour long essay where i give you two poems and i ask you to to, in some way bring those poems together. they might be poems, about a similar subject, uh they might be poems uh from the beginning and the end of a of a particular writer's career, uh they might be poems that that are, in the same form, but use that form differently or with greater or less success. i might_ i can imagine even saying here are, here are two sonnets uh, given what you know about the sonnet and how it can, can be used to create an argument, which of these poems is more successful in achieving in achieving_ that's a pretty narrow question it's a lot narrower than one i would, than one i would ask. um, it is much more likely to be a kind of thematic um, thematic question. kay and then_ i don't know when you're coming back but when, when you come back you should check with Laura and see when i'm doing the review session. alright  okay. mhm so it's likely that i might do the review session on the twenty-third. alright. and with the um the beginning with the short response (at the end with,) the um you know the given the i_ lines to identify and match do you think it's gonna be uh, with the checked poems or those gonna be with different poems  okay  alright. well that's, that's good to know. i don't think so. i think that that_ so long you know you've been keeping up, right along and, doing the work as we've we've moved through it, so there shouldn't be any surprises. there shouldn't be any surprises in in terms of the kinds of things i'm, i'm looking for. if you imagine yourself, conducting one of these discussions and conducting it in, in the way that seem has seemed most successful to you, then that's where (we'll be.) okay   sure   the humor mm no i actually i um, i actually did a performance at the um museum, it was like uh, this last weekend and this was actually a part of like my performance  okay  oh okay, okay (more than anything) and who taught that course? it was uh Olabayo Olaniyi a, traveling artist from Nigeria. oh okay sure. yeah, oh that's good. yeah it was   through the Art  yeah yeah, i'm not sure where it's gonna go but okay. happy to do it. yeah well you have a nice weekend a good happy Easter. yes thank you. oh i should_ well (xx) should i have you fill out a, an evaluation form? we'll skip  and i'll (xx) i'll do it later. alright alright thank you. good \",\n",
       "       \"pleasure uh to welcome Jerry Schneewind here to Michigan again, um, i've been, learning history of ethics from Jerry for, more years than i, wanna count, since first year in graduate school, i think probably the first course you ever, taught Kant at least that that's what you said at the time, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah well s- yeah that was, not meant to be a, temporal RESTRICTED you mean Kant wasn't first? RESTRICTED let's take our divinely decreed canonical break RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i'll just ask it. um... so, uh, we were saying in the break um, you discussed this letter, uh from, from Hume to Hutcheson uh that's, talking about similar aspects of Hutcheson's views and whether, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED pla- ple- it did plague people RESTRICTED well i- m- m- it's e- it's a little different than voluntarism right, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED no but that's the point for for RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED the uh voluntarist position you attributed i think to Law, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and is that because they assume that God not only has power but has, rationality? RESTRICTED i thought it was interesting, how you placed the um, the, Hume section on, um sentiments uh moral sentiments not being derived from reason, um in the context of deism. or, what are these arguments about voluntarism and i was wondering if you could extend that into that, um small passage at the end where Hume's law, figures in, i was wondering specifically whether you, you would say that the, his is ought distinction there might have been a thinly veiled argument against, uh similar to Euthrypo uh -phro argument, uh against the idea that since God wills it it is good. RESTRICTED actually on on this point i mean i, i wonder if, uh the point you're making about, in particular about sort of constitutes- constitutional arguments RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uh, i have a, picture of Hume which may not be the right picture RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED oh no i was saying you weren't RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uhuh i guess if you were a subjectivist about uh moral sense and thought that uh, things we disapproved of were, wrong because we disapproved of them and you thought that we disapproved of them because, God decided to get us to disapprove of them, then then you would, have God uh, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED um, i w- i was just gonna say okay so you're reading him in in denying rationalism. he's uh, he's primarily trying to deny that there's any sort of like like truth that would be binding on both us, and on God RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah i mean i guess what i'm thinking is i mean like, you know Kant's gonna say, you know is gonna, parse categorical as, binding on all beings insofar as they're rational. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah uh i guess i'm not uh very clear, i don't know much about this history anyway but, i'm not very clear about, w- how to construe the rationalists. okay now, suppose somebody, reads uh Calvin or uh Luther and so forth but uh, that he thinks this uh voluntarism is uh, is uh terrible in some way. and it makes God into a tyrant and uh arbitrary and all this kind of stuff okay so that can't be the right story. about uh God and morality. uh so what's an alternative? well he happens to think one alternative is, uh there are some rational necessary truths about morality, you could RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah. well you say there could there could be the rationalists who do- who doesn't say, uh, who doesn't think that the rationality you might say of these, a priori RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah that that that's right. now if you thought that the only alternative to, to voluntarism was r- some kind of rationalism, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it it's gonna be your faith that God cannot be a voluntarist, supporter RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED um i was just curious about the uh rationalist, explanation of revelation RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED w- now they weren't saying the the rationalists we're talking about weren't saying s- revelation is, necessary to salvation would you say? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uh uh i wonder if you think that uh the voluntarists would be vulnerable to the following kind of argument. uh i mean it it does seem to me that, uh, there is a very strong strand of voluntarism in the scriptural tradition, that they're coming out of. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED every other semester. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED um, so this view, uh that you mentioned that um, in fact, if you haven't heard about the Christian revelation um then you're okay but once you hear it if you reject it then now you're in trouble. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED ah well. RESTRICTED um this is um, um right s- so, so, the way it works if i have it right Hume says look if you want, morality with your, religion you get, sort of uh a voluntarism. only option. right? now... um, can can other aspects of Hume's attack on religion be read as um, sort of two pronged attack here so you got this voluntarism and now you've got ah uh now you've got to rely on things like miracles. and and then on miracles it's, so. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED Neither of them have got a statue put up to him, nicely in Paris. RESTRICTED um, in regards to the genesis, of this voluntarism, was there, any sort of, scepticism, on the side of the voluntarists, against the very idea of there being something like a moral fact? \",\n",

(yeah.) i have a question. okay the effect of tolerance was just, you can act- you can think of both of these, this and this as just being, two ways, where you, form some manipulation that causes receptors, five-H-T-two-A receptors to down-regulate, so you have fewer of them, or you have more of them. okay so with tolerance, if you give L-S-D repeatedly, what happens, is if you go in and look and measure just assay with a binding assay the number of five-H-T-two receptors, in animals that have been made tolerant, given repeated injection of L-S-D, you get, down-regulation you get fewer five-H-T-two-A receptors. and, you get behavioral tolerance. that is, the behavioral syndrome that you get in the animal, is decreased. so if receptors go down, behavior goes down. and then there's the loose connection to humans cuz you know with humans, n- when you you you get good tolerance as well. with the other one with the denervation supersensitivity you do the lesions, receptor populations go up, and behavioral potency goes up, they show, greater potency. so as, you man- as you manipulate the receptor population up or down, the behavior follows. i have a question  yeah. i actually haven't given you this hypothesis yet. i'm just giving you the data so far. but i'll, i'll state it very clearly in a couple slides. but, yeah. that's gonna be the difference. the previous one was that it was acting, the previous, hypothesis was it was acting at this receptor, the presynaptic, mechanism. and i'm obviously leading up to it's acting at these guys. and that_ not only that but, these guys, are, five-H-T-two-A receptors specifically. and th- this kind of data suggests that. so if you do this kind of a correlation with other types of serotonin receptors, it doesn't work, o- out as well. and i'll give you another, another piece of evidence i mean, i told you there are fourteen different kinds of serotonin receptors so you should be asking, how do you know it's the five-H-T-two-A one, specifically? cuz there's lots of other serotonin receptors we've, found postsynaptically. and i haven't actually given you good evidence for that yet but that's coming. yeah? um, you said that the, effect of the antagonist was to, decrease the effects of L-S-D, yeah no it doesn't have any effect on the cell firing. so, if you give a five-H-T-two receptor antagonist, you have an electrode in an animal, cuz you can record serotonin cell firing, okay? uh, and you give L-S-D, cell firing goes down, and the animal show these hallucinatory behavior. now you can experiment where you, in your experimental group, you give 'em the five-H-T-two receptor antagonist, and do the same experiment, now give 'em L-S-D what happens? cell firing still goes down, that's not changed, but they don't hallucinate, they don't show this hallucinatory behavior anymore. it's another dissociation between cell firing. presumably, this is not, t- five-H-T-two-A antagonist, is antagonizing the action of serotonin, justify these two A receptors there's fourteen other ones there. presumably, this is not a five-H-T-two-A receptor. but, some other one is. and it's, probably postsynaptic. cuz with this there are presynaptic receptors. um, if like someone reported to an emergency room, with a, bad acid trip would they give him a, a compound to pull him out of it? no. they they, couldn't do anything, you know could- in that setting could they try? put him in a safe place, talk to him nicely and, could that be a setting where they could try the, serotonin antagonist? well these are not yet, the- these compounds have, lots of other effects, they're not the kind of things that, that you would do, to antagonize uh, a bad trip. okay, exam on Tuesday, don't forget. \",\n",
       "       \"good evening... my name is Sidonie Smith, and i am the Director of Women's Studies, on behalf of the Women's Studies Program, the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, and the Michigan Initiative, in Women's Health, i want to welcome you, to this, the second annual, Vivian R Shaw, lecture. the Vivian R Shaw lecture series, has been made possible, by a generous gift from Ellen Agress, a nineteen sixty-eight graduate of the College of Literature Science and the Arts, who is currently Senior Vice President and Deputy General Council, for Communications for News America Publishing, Incorporated. Ellen donated her gift to the Women's Studies Program, and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, in honor of her mother, Vivian R Shaw, who died of breast cancer, at age fifty, when Ellen was a junior here at Michigan. to honor her mother, Ellen specifically wanted this lecture series to bring to campus scholars, and public figures, who would address a real issue, afi- a real-life issue, affecting the lives of women and girls. it is especially appropriate then, that this year the Vivian R Shaw lecture, is part of a yearlong series, of public lectures, on women's health, historical perspectives, and policy dilemmas. this series of public lectures has been made possible by a broad coalition, of co-sponsors, bringing diverse campus units together to support discussion of women's health in historical perspectives, and in its policy implications, and, uh you may want to refer to the back of the um program, it lists the um co-sponsors of the series itself... at the inaugural Vivian R Shaw lecture last year, Ellen's daughter Emily was present to introduce her mother. tonight Emily, now a senior here at Michigan, double-majoring in musical theor- theater and in psychology, returns once again, to honor her grandmother, by introducing, her mother. please join me in welcoming the granddaughter of Vivian R Shaw, Emily Vivian Agress. thank you very much. hello. i have been given the incredible honor for the second year in a row, to introduce the woman who has made this entire event possible, my mother and mentor Ellen Agress. my mother, uh my mother never ceases to amaze me. uh she, all_ though she managed to, fulfill a full-time executive career, she also was able to be a full-time mother to both my brother and i. she is by far the smartest person i know. i'll confess i still send her my papers to proofread. um i hope you all have the opportunity to uh, endow a lecture series so that perhaps one of your children can, well it's my turn. i'm Abby Stewart Director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, and i'm delighted to welcome this wonderful family, um, back to Ann Arbor, and uh my special, job, and pleasure, is to welcome Joan Brumberg to Ann Arbor and to tell you a little bit about her before she, tells us about, The Body Project. um... the range and breadth of Professor Brumberg's knowledge and expertise will i think be made clear to you by many things, but one indicator is the fact that she is currently the Steven Weiss Presidential Fellow and Professor of, History, Human Development, and Women's Studies, at Cornell University, and that's a very unusual package, to be a professor of all three of those things, uh and her books, make obvious, how much_ how deep and wide is her knowledge in these different fields and others, like medicine. she's taught at Cornell, since completing her education at the University of Rochester, Boston College, and the University of Virginia. most of us in this room know Professor Brumberg as the author of The Body Project, An Intimate History of American Girls, and um we do have it here courtesy of Shaman Drum and you're invited to uh meet with, Professor Brumberg after the lecture, uh if you'd like to have her sign your book or talk to her a little bit more. many of you probably also know that she's the author of Fasting Girls, the Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa As a Modern Disease, and Mission for Life, the Judson Family, an American Evangelical Culture. she has truly distinguished herself, as an authority both on the experience of adolescence among girls and the particular developmental v- vulnerabilities girls face. the hallmark of her work is the combination of rich psychological insight, acute social analysis, and creative historical research, all delivered in the books, with a beautiful writing style. in her recent work, she is clearly interested in the ordinary vicissitudes, of adolescence for girls in contemporary America as well as in the past. she retains, though a concern about the potential for the deeper trouble, that some girls end up in, as she was uh exploring in Fasting Girls and anorexia. Professor Brumberg has been recognized with teaching awards from her institution, as well as by a Guggenheim Fellowship, grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and Rockefeller Foundation, as well as the MacDowell Colony Residency. she's worked on a number of public history projects, i think part of her commitment to, the broader issues of citizenship that, some, academics are concerned about. she's consulted on a film project on the history of the Girl Scouts, an exhibit on the history of asylums in New York state, and historical site interpretation for museum educators. she's currently working on a project on girls diaries, which doesn't surprise me at all because she used girls diaries in the pr- Body Project with great success. so i know i'm looking forward to her new work. meanwhile i'm eager as i'm sure you are to hear what she has to say tonight, because i know many people have shared my own experience of having read the Body Project, and having found that Linda Kerber was correct when she wrote on the book jacket, that i'm, delighted to be in Arb- in Ann Arbor. i always feel that there are connections between Michigan and Cornell, um having admitted women about the same time, um, and delighted to see how strong and vital your, um, opportunities are here for the study of gender, uh at both the Center and in Women's Studies so, it's been_ it's really nice for me. and i wanna thank also, um, uh, i i'm delighted to be part of the Vivian Shaw, lecture series. so lemme start what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna talk for a while, and then i'm gonna show some slides and then i'm gonna come back and, talk a little bit more, just to give you a a road map. um, a century ago, American women were lacing themselves into corsets, and teaching their adolescent daughters to do the same thing. but today's teens, some with rings in their eyebrows and noses, shop for thong bikinis on their own and their middle class parents are likely to be uninvolved, until the moment when the credit card bill arrives in the mail. now this this transition in the experience of young women tells us a great deal about what's happened, to female adolescents in the contemporary world. it's also kind of a useful imaginative backdrop for my remarks to you this evening which are based on, The Body Project, an Intimate History of American Girls. a little bit of intellectual biography, first. in nineteen eighty-eight when i published Fasting Girls which was a book about the history of anorexia nervosa, i was already thinking about the relationship between American culture, and adolescent female bodies. those who've read the book know that cultural imperatives, particularly the link in the twentieth century between slimness, and female perfection, are an important part of my explanation of the increasing incidence of eating disorders. however although my work is very much in the social constructionist vein, i never argued, that anorexia nervosa was caused by culture alone. there clearly are some intervening personal, psychological and familial variables, that explain the etiology of anorexia nervosa, as well as other eating disorders. but in the years since the publication of Fasting Girls, i gave a great deal of thought to what it is about American culture, that makes female adolescence so difficult. important work by Carol Gilligan Mary Heifer Peggy Orenstein, the (Satfers) i'm sure some of you have read this material. it all sounds a clear alarm, for American girls more so than boys adolescence is a time of declining confidence, silence, and danger. and many of you in the audience may also be familiar with the unsettling fact, that, uh studies show that until puberty, women really are the healthier sex, by all measures. mental health measures as well as, biomedical measures. now because so much contemporary social science literature suggests, that the body is a serious problematic for girls, beginning in puberty, i decided to focus my attention, on the adolescent female body, to give it a history, and to map the ways in which the inevitable physical transformations, of this stage of life, have been negotiated in different generations, of American girls. so instead of writing a history of bulimia, which some people expected me to do, i moved away from pathology, to normative experience. my new book rests on the assumption, that the female adolescent body has a history. maybe a distinctly American one. and that what happens to girls, in the process of physical and emotional development changes, to some extent, over time. i say to some extent because i want to acknowledge the tension, between, what is hard-wired into the organism, and into the developmental process, and what is culturally constructed. unlike other history books, i begin with a biological event and that event is menarche, the first period. and the narrative then moves through a profoundly important sequence of physical developments, such as the appearance of breasts the eruptions of acne, the emergence of sexuality. body parts usually don't appear in works in history, unless they're lost on the battlefield, but they're circle pins what? oh my god \"],\n",
