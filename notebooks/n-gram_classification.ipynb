       "array([\"if everyone's here, um, my name is Dale Jerome, and i'm a volunteer docent, is the word we use here, but it really means tour guide, i i have a question yes you said if the second floor was dedicated to the art  i assume it was alumni offices. uh, it was office space and, i- i don't know, exactly what was in the office space but since it's called Alumni Memorial Hall, oh okay Garden of Eden. okay, the Garden of Eden... now that's more of a, a concept but of course we're looking, at a t- fruit tree here of some sort, um, a figure. this, animal coiled around here and it's all taking place, in a l- in a garden. anything that i've missed? how do we know it's a garden? there's plants. yeah. there are plants. um, anything else i may have missed? the fruit tree? the fruit tree,  the water. the water. if you look way beyond, what is the land here, you'll see that these hues of blue these uh these shades of blue, vary a little bit in the background, and if you look very closely, you'll see fingers of green or brown that come out into that blue, which i interpret as land, um you you may not you may have some other ideas and i'd like to hear that... so_ and then we have a river of course, um that's coming through the garden, and so uh i think that we can fairly say that this is, then a river a body of wat- a, lake or ocean or whatever, that um, is the- this river empties into. well then let's think about, what, signs how has, the artist used for instance um, color or space or, um, i- the way he's drawn the forms, what things give you the idea that this is the Garden of Edian- Eden? or is it the arrangement of things any ideas?   yeah okay we're yeah. and these are all very familiar, to us of a Western European tradition, or Christian tradition, we recognize those immediately. now we'll see a piece later in the tour, from the Senufo culture in Africa, where we can't really touch, the iconography that we see. um, but here it's very familiar to us. you see the snake, and my s- the snake is, the most favorite part for me because he looks so evil, in these Renaissance, with these, you know bar- well he doesn't have barred teeth he's looking rather chagrined i guess here at Eve. innocent. yeah curious. curious, innocent. and she's not, totally aware of what she's buying into here, it doesn't look like. um, she has these long flowing curls and it has been said that, such figures as these may be the prototypes for, or come from the pictures of the Virgin that would follow, though uh if you_ there're lots of pictures of the Virgin in here, and if you look around you will see that you don't often see the Virgin, s- shown with long flowing hair it's usually covered by a, habit-looking cloak. um, you can see that the artist has, tried to give you some idea of spatial recession. now this isn't very sophisticated. uh, because it took us a long time to find the ocean and the water right? do you know anything about the choice of, the frame in the picture?   who conserv- who_ do you have conservationists here that_ (i don't-) actually this_ we send most of our things to Oberlin College we don't have_ um actually i shouldn't say that. in the_ in Asian art, we have one of the foremost conservation laboratories in the nation, um but, i think that most of the oils have gone, to Oberlin if i'm not mistaken i know that large one over there did. when you were talking about conservation earlier you ment- something mentioned something about ultraviolet mhm they can put_ i think it's ultraviolet i'm almost positive it's ultraviolet they put it under a light and they're able to see, the sketches or the underpainting, of whatever was done, if the artist uh painted out something. uh, and there're very few pieces that, a museum would own, where you have the backup sketches so it's sort of neat to be able to see how the thing developed, and, if our s- supposition is right and they did paint, these brambles in later, it's sort of interesting to think well, why was this so important? flowers. flowers. okay and here we see flowers... anything else maybe lots of trees and animals trees, animals, so lots of,  something secluded like, nature in the raw or something  is that the shrinkwrap? uh, shrinkwrap. it isn't shrinkwrap it might, sorta look like it though. i'm not sure how i feel about this because this is an installation which is, sort of a new, new type of art that, different media allows us to use we're no longer confor- fined to painting within a frame, feel free to walk around it, you're meant to walk around it and get different views of it... h- how do you define an installation? what do you_ what does it exactly mean? well it- an installation is an, art piece it doesn't necessarily have to be three-dimensional but it's made for a specific, site. oh are these all sculpted? well, um, these are not, sculpted. this is a very interesting process, and i think it really, um shows, how, broadening, possibilities as far as media is concerned, uh has broadened the possibilities for art. can you all hear me? okay. um, what Miss Ferrari did, was, use, fetal pigs, as um they come in a box and they're called, piglets it is labelled, and um so she's used these, to make, the castings from, she used a resin, and plaster casting, from a latex mold and the latex, evidently mold allows one to capture great detail. um the snakes, oddly enough, came from a tax- taxidermist. and evidently i didn't realize this people bring in their snakes to have mounted as trophies and so they take the skin off it, a- and then put another, you know substance inside. and so she's working in the same way she could get these snake skins, from uh the taxidermist and then, proceeded from there but again, using this um, latex material, f- to make the mold, and therefore capturing such detail. um, well what ideas do you get from this? she's called this piece Garden... what are some, any of you, offer, how do you feel about looking at it is there any message that... why do you think she might have called it Garden?... irony? irony? okay. can you, expand that a little bit? well because it doesn't seem to be, a collection of things that have been fostered for life it seems like a collection of things that have been killed. okay. let- i'm gonna repeat that just so you_ did you all hear that? no okay. uh it was pointed out, that it doesn't look as if these things, have been, nurtured for life but rather that they're in a, that they've been killed that they're in a dead state. so that irony. any other, ideas that come to mind? a snake might eat a piglet. okay. that's one idea. um, let me tell it to you a little bit from the point of view of the artist. i hav- i have to ask you not to touch it unfortunately. though, i think that this is very very tactile i mean i wanna just slide over the top of it. i don't. um, the, i had a chance actually i was very fortunate to talk to the artist, who's from Detroit, um for about a half an hour day before yesterday, and um, she sees this as being quite a benign thing, and called it Garden, because, she sees sort of this as being the beginning of life, sort of the haphazard arrangement, that might be attached to sort of the, um, primordial mess th- out of which came life, and she also looks at it as, death so she she se- seeing seeing things more as the life cycle here. um... how does she come to this? well what about the color. what does the color, mean to you. flesh. flesh. okay. is it healthy flesh or, dead flesh or young healthy flesh. young healthy flesh. mhm. um, she painted can you imagine, each one of these with a high gloss paint individually she also, cast each one of these individually so, uh you can imagine that this was, there's lots of little dead piglets lying around. what makes you think they're dead? they look dead. why do they look dead? i'm gonna push you a little bit they're lying around they're just lying around. they're just lying around. there's no mother.  um there's so many of them. there's so many of them. so it doesn't, they s- do they seem lifeless? they're sleeping they're lying around they don't look sleeping it looks like a dumping ground for little piglets. now... she would dispute this. that, death is what, o- one carries away from this. she sees a lot more life attached to this. a quite even balance between life and death. and, part of it she pointed out was the color, um, but that these are piglets sleeping she's not slashed them open in any way she's not damaged them in any way. and, in addition, you know the label on the box says piglets it doesn't say dead pigs sort of thing. i think it's the ears.  they  jellied piglets. it could be, that you and i who have all dissected piglets, bring this association. she claims that when small children who don't have this association at all, have seen it, they're looking at more as if the pigs are sleeping on each other there's a lot more feeling of, connectedness, to this. and sort of, well i don't know whether the right word is community but, living together in harmony, sort of thing. what about the snakes though, yeah  the snakes are, alive. the snakes are alive. right and and i guess you could say that that's part of this life process two different stages that she's showing here. um, and i don't know maybe we could say then there is, maybe that's what gives me the idea, me personally that there is some sort of competition between the snake and the piglet and, one's, preying upon the other or whatever... um, we_ well what gives you the idea of, death here? wha- visually what what, what techniques has she used to, show the end of life? or maybe we've already gone on, ni- into that. none of the pigs have their heads raised in contrast to the snakes and, even though they're surrounded by, snakes which potentially could be predators they're not, not a single one of the thousands of pigs, here is,  yeah right, okay. they're pretty limp looking. yeah they're sort of, flaccid and so, the p- snakes i think, many are saying have a lot more animation to them than the pigs do that are just sort of, lying there limp. one of you mentioned the number of things, and, this you can see she's repeated, the snake and the pig motif over and over and over again. now there're two things that we could think about that repetition does. one is, it sort of, vivifies, the, message. i mean if you see um... a mass grave...   that was the first thing i thought of. i mean it seems sort of sad if she, has created something that evokes such a strong association and reaction in people that is exactly, not what she wanted. well, she may wanna work with this piece more. um, she did point out to me, and i think this is very true, that oftentimes we look for art always to be uplifting, and as if that were the artistic tradition when in reality they were doing things, such as Eve in there with these horrible little demons who were making saints be, dying and so there's a lotta horror in, Medieval and Renaissance, art that we sort of, forget about in the, getting the truth and beauty end of things. so um, there is a tradition for this. so what again was it that she_ that besides the color, that, evokes life for her? i think she's just looking at the sort of, disorder there's a lot of movement in here i think maybe you could say, um... that this is sort of the beginning of life. hm' are the pieces that_ on there are they attached, to you know i don't know that. i don't know that. it comes down in about a day so. either she's gonna go out with a lotta boxes like the art fair, it looks like this is panelled. this is i think some sort of, i w- used to think it's Styrofoam but i think it's some sort of fiberboard. hm. um, i have a couple of other things to show you upstairs. if y- i see that we have, one woman, pregnant so maybe you'd like a chair  if you_ we don't have chairs per se but we do have some stools over there which are portable if you want to pick one up as we go upstairs feel free to do so. and, uh we're going up to the head of the stairs here if you wanna follow me. how's our time going? thirty-six minutes... i'm notorious for, i haven't been up here in a long time. maybe we should stop here and i should go back to sort of just orienting people as to where they are.  would you say uh these figures are bisexual? because um it is what? a bisexual figure. um, because you said the horn is a, male   um, this figure is the male. now evidently they, they usually sh- show, the male and female together yeah mhm mhm is there anything, extraordinary about this in terms of abstraction? i mean isn't it, sort of surprising the, the way it's done, just artistically? well... i think that, two things come to my mind. one is that most of these pieces are made out of a single piece of wood. so when you think of the medium, and you think of all the possibilities for instance, with latex molds that, Ferrari had downstairs, and then you think of a th- single piece of wood and rather woo- rude carving materials, that puts considerable constraints on what you see. um, as far as finishing the wood, um, a lot of that is done with natural finishes and just use actually. um but it's very well balanced i mean there's, tha- i'm sure these people have fingers and there's no, there's no hands and, i mean it's it's linear it's a lot like um, i mean, a lot of modern painters, you know (xx)  it could be an entrance or an exit. okay... the frame (of the first two) kind of (xx) okay, that's another, uh, good deduction to make that i hadn't thought of. are there any, other, of_ others of you who see relationships with the things we, saw before?... i'm just thinking of the door that we_ i mean this obviously doesn't have a door but it definitely, is_ or i shouldn't say definitely is_ to me, it is an entrance. what makes you think that? what visually, makes you, think of that. let's s- sort of take it apart... the space in the middle. (xx) okay. there's a void in the middle and a very intentional void. so it really now, becomes a part of the design. and this is different, from earlier sculpture you would've seen. um, if you go downstairs and i think they're still where they used to be, look at the neoclassical, uh two marble sculptures on either side of that central presitio- partition as you come in. there aren't very many voids there, you're more focused as you're looking at it, on the woman, whose dress is being blown by the wind and leaning over with her staff etcetera etcetera. you're not looking at the voids to tell you part of the story. and here you have to. this is more and more, usual i think, as um, you, you come up into the Modern Era Contemporary Era of art. um... and i won't go into it deeply here but if_ i was trying to think of other pieces in this room that might, beg for this sort of analysis the one right behind you i think does, which doesn't say much, just on a two-dimensional, basis, but, if you think of voids and, the relationship of spaces there, i think you'll find that it's quite rich. also with the Giacometti sculpture over here, um, though it's quite dense, in terms of material because of its shape, this very long thin elongated shape, you sort of need to see this, space around it. um in order to get the full impact of it and the Hepworth back there is another way of looking at things i'll get into too much of that but, i think that that's a fun way, to to look at art in a gallery is to take an idea like that, and then look at how artists are playing with that. so, we've talked about the voids and the, positive spaces here. what else makes you think it is a, entrance exit? well the curves up above the lintel the, the one that's farthest from you is, seems to be the most, massive or it, it could imply that it's attached to the mass mhm mhm. is there an architectural form it reminds you of? an arch an arch, right. and um, well i guess it's on here, Arch Margarita this is a whole series that she did and i was tempted to bring you pieces of other, things in the series so you could see, how she changed each, piece a little bit. but one of the ways it was, is in the lintel, and some of it is, some of the pieces are quite a bit heavier, up here on top, than this is. this seems to be very graceful to me at the top in fact that's why i love it. there's such a lightness, to those lines up there, even though they are, you know, well this one is rather, thin but otherwise you've got, you know you've got a big, expanse of bronze there. so we have the, lintel and post construction of a door, and um, very reminiscent of the arch, and i i'm sure that many of you read here on the label that that's actually what she was getting, um her, her uh inspiration from is some, ruins in Greece of Greek architecture. Linberg um, i've had the pleasure and, honor of meeting her a couple of times, and um, a very personable woman, um, but she lives in Detroit has her studio i believe in Bloomfield Hills and she sho- she has a gallery in, Birmingham and also in New York. she's included in a lot of collections, um, often, she, seems to take this architectural, uh approach to things, and she's made another series, which is a series of columns that are_ that have sort of f- very, simple, figures, but elegant, female figures embedded in them, that are, very solid so that it gives one the impression, that a w- a woman is standing there almost as a column. the facial expressions are so simplified as to resemble in many ways the Senufo that we just, saw. so, i think it's interesting, that architecture, is her inspiration so much. probably another good reason why i like it so much cuz i like architecture. um   exactly. and this is where it all came from. i mean the, welded seams, everything, i i think the technique on this is just impeccable to me. and the other thing i think is interesting is what it does with shadows. yeah oh wow um, i would love to have this piece in my house. mhm mhm thank you. so is everything in the museum right now, in the collection or there are_ is there a tra- there are, travelling exhibits right now or   it's part of the permanent collection? yeah. and they just sort of rotate stuff? yeah because the collection is_ i don't know exactly how many pieces but it's quite, extensive. wow.  it's such a great painting. and we have a lot of very good Picasso prints. so we we have a fairly good overall, look at his, mhm that's pretty abstract. yeah. but, see now you could even look at the Joanie Mitchell over there as a garden. that was an imagined landscape for her, hm'  yep. hm'   thanks. thank you. okay. thanks again. \",\n",
       "       \"okay on focus? alright? i've discovered you guys are all much more sensitive to that than i am so, uh okay, we've been talking about uh formal structural models of the retirement process. uh, we did the Gustman and Steinmeier, model last class and today, um, guess we'll spend all the time on so-called option value models Lumsdaine, Stock and Wise, although we'll get a small head start in thinking about uh, dynamic programming models as well because part of what they do is compare their preferred model, to one that is still the more elaborate. uh... basically the the, theme of the paper, um is to compare, three models of increasing complexity, using exactly the same data. and, just as a general... point about doing research, bu- on the same data, is a really nice feature of this paper. because normally what happens when you try to teach a course like this, is that you have, researchers and models, and data, and you hope that the differences and conclusions are  today we we have no... handout? oh i'm sorry, (xx) handouts. thanks but that's a problem because it's like, when they will model_ i don't know the model but when they will model their choice of going into retirement, people who retire don't think of_ just about that but about missing opportunities. th- that's particularly important for the application that they're going to have. so the_ yeah the i mean um, well lemme, yes th- part of what the paper is about, is about retirement in normal times. okay? um and once you make a kind of_ one can have a discussion within oneself about whether, partial retirement jobs or omitting partial retirement jobs or not modeling partial retirement jobs is an important flaw in that context. um they're going to apply it to an early-out window. okay? which is, a deliberate attempt to get people who are not really ready to retire, to retire to leave... okay? and so the early retirement window is going to induce people who otherwise wouldn't be retiring, to leave early, and the question of what they do after they leave is is kind of doubly important. okay? so for the the group of workers that that that they would be studying um, normally uh the issue of what happens to them after leaving the firm is potentially important. for the group of workers who are be- whose departure is being accelerated by the early-out window, uh the issue of what they do afterwards is doubly important. and and you know what this reflects is just the fact that, uh you know we started out saying here's a model, here're all the things we would like to fix about that model, and now we're gonna watch the papers try to fix them one or two at a time. okay, so this is one that as you'll see is going to not do a very good job, uh with_ is not going to do anything really about modeling what happens after you leave the firm, um but it does a very good job with other things and, so it's a it's a,  so so what, what this, what these uh, nineteen eighty-two  so what but they are the same mhm um  yeah it depends also on the learning process. so let let me come back to that and you'll_ i'll give you sort of a simple example of where they would be striking error. but one of the things it's going to depend on is, um, sort of how, uh h- how the error terms line up over time. whether you can learn_ whether observing today's error term tells you something important about tomorrow's error term. because then there's some gain from waiting until you can observe today's error term. w- w- we'll come back to that. and we'll actually t- talk i think more about it on Thursday as well. okay? um  well no it's not through the discount factor so much right because this cou- this is sort of present versus future and this is just a matter of do i have to work for the money or not? yeah but, that will be the same thing it's like because that would mean that you would more heavily discount the, that's actually very similar to saying that you, more heavily discount the future after you start you start retirement... ah  he notes though, you have a (sine N) there so do you really need an expectation T there? i mean you know that, right? no i don't know how happy i'm gonna be right cuz i don't know what the (xx) yeah but i'm talking about in time T, the for the second part of that. um, wouldn't you  okay, alright thanks what's K-T of (xx) yeah? okay  like if you have like (a rash) uh, adaptive expectation they should be the same. uhh no. or very similar,  wait where they would be the same?  well maybe there's some information that like you know like you know is coming some, renegotiation or well okay gimme a_ well there's a particular      mm you kept going though you didn't stop. well i meant it to include things not just graduate school alright? ah no   so from the firm's perspective why would they offer higher bonuses to people who are closer to sixty-five? uh probably because they desperately wanna get those people out. i mean i- in the optimal design of these things is actually quite complicated um, it depends so, how does this, comply with the critical focus because it said that when you this i don't know this seems like very, problematic for me from the Lucas point of view, in which he said that when you change the the policy like when you change the policy so people change their, expectations so we should not expect the uh rationally not expect that, anything would happen. okay well well so far we're still talking about the, kind of normal policy. okay so nineteen eighty, was a normal year not the year of the early retirement window. okay so i think that's, where you more have the Lucas problem is um what happens once they offer the window and how does that change people's expectations. okay? the story line that they're going to want you to accept i believe, um which i think is probably okay in this application and maybe not as okay in other applications, is that this was really seen where the window was really seen as a once and for all, experience. and so, it really didn't, change people's expectations a- although i'll talk about a subtle way in which it might have even if it were a one off. l- let me come back to that i- i'll i won't answer it fully but i i'll at least, touch on that issue, um the way in which that would where you_ i wouldn't have called it the Lucas critique but actually you'll you'll see it in in the next slide. okay? so for predicting who retires in nineteen eighty which is normal times all of the models do about equally well. um but for predicting the response to the window, um the two more sophisticated models do much better. okay? and why is that? well we kind of, let the cat out of the bag a couple slides ago right? we said that, if you're a probit person and they offer you six months' pay to leave now, and you think about do i wanna leave now or work another year, then you wanna leave now. right? but if you're a, option value or a stochastic dynamic programming person you say well if i leave now i won't be able to work till sixty-five like i was planning to do. so i'll compare that six months' of pay, against, not just working one more year where it clearly wouldn't make sense to do so but, whole bunches of future years. and if i think about it that way it's a much less attractive option. okay so basically the option value and the stochastic dynamic programming models get right the idea that the window is not very attractive to people who were planning on staying a good while longer. and the probit model doesn't get that and so the probit model basically predicts that everybody will wanna leave. okay? and i'm slightly exaggerating. but basically it will overpredict how many people'll want to leave. and so what i think that the the paper clearly does, is it shows that the kinds of sophistication that are in the option value or the stochastic dynamic program models, are really quite important uh for problems where the incentives become, sharply nonlinear at one point in time as they do, obviously with an early-out window. i mean to be honest i'm surprised given the early retirement, accrual spike um that the probit does as well as it does. okay that is i would have thought that the probit would have had problems uh predicting that people would retire the year before_ two years before early retirement. uh whereas the option value and the S-D-P would tend to get that right too. um so i'm actually surprised the probit does as well as it does. um, but but that's what they find. so but would that would mean would actually, retire from that firm even earlier...  okay so so but can you say something is like when they_ to what extent like i could expect that K should be, less not not more? um i'm not sure which parameter it would bias. i mean o- one of the, problems with these nonlinear models is that as soon as you notice something wrong, you're kind of, you don't have the intuition that you have in a linear model, about which parameter it would likely bias. um, mkay just to wrap up cuz we're running out of time, uh, the zero mean innovations to the error term. okay? um this is the idea that the marginal utility of leisure increases with age. what's kind of strikingly missing from the paper is, age or time as an independent determiner of retirement. okay so we don't have health in there we let health be in the error term. but the error term's a zero mean. taken literally that means that if the error term reflects health i'm not getting sicker as i get older. and while we would like that to be true we kinda suspect it's not. okay so there's nothing in the model that's capturing the intuition that as people get older, on average it gets harder for them to show up for work... um this gets now to Mato's point. even if i think that the window offer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, okay which is actually probably how these workers saw it, there's still the issue of how does that policy change by the firm change the expectation of the workers. and i think you could reasonably expect that the window offers would even if it did nothing else even if it didn't lead workers to expect another window offer in a year, it probably should revise their forecasts about their earnings. i mean a booming vibrant firm does not say hey guys, wouldn't you like to retire? alright a firm that says, hey guys wouldn't you like to retire is probably a firm that's having trouble. if the firm is in some sense that desperate is it likely to be giving ten percent wage increases to the people that stay next year? right after having, asked me politely would i like to leave in exchange for a small, subsidy, this year, are they likely to offer me the big bucks as a raise next year if i stay? well probably not. okay so the model assumes that this firm is a stable and stodgy enough large employer that if you know your earnings at fifty-five you can pretty well guess your earnings at sixty-five. and whatever the reliability of that assumption in normal times, you would think that, people might change their expectations about, future retirement. in some sense what would get you to retire in response to the window, is a combination of the dreck financial incentive which is modeled, and the implicit bad news about your career prospects at this firm, which are not modeled, okay? so suppose somebody didn't respond to the financial incentive of the window offer at all, but said hey, this likely means that, my remaining years at this firm are not going to be as but if you're comparing_ if you're just trying to compare the option value to the probit, and the probit said that too many people le- th- this would, this would mean that pe- more people would leave than would otherwise here,  (xx) (you know) next week we we don't have (time) let's try for Friday and then with the option to cancel how's that? i i would feel  oh Friday doesn't work okay (xx) so it's like not the best, time (to meet) fine um because i the trouble is i ca- i can't, now (xx) come to the point uh be on uh s- be stuck with the empirical question. okay well uh, let's see what would would work Monday on Monday it's from one to two thirty or, or how about two o'clock, would that two two-thirty does that work for you? yeah that's fine. did you leave entire bag (xx) it was i- it was on purpose, i had to go to the_ see  that's not the problem because, i have done at least some examples (xx.) \",\n",
       "       \"duh, well, i ain't so sure what we're gonna do today... to (straighten) up my horror of course is, the idea that i talk like other professors. surely that's not the case, tell me that's not the case. um, we have a little housekeeping business to, attend to today uh, i have the first uh, set of papers to give back to, a handful of you who uh wrote on, uh this topic. i'll do that in just a second. uh but let me make a couple of points to you, uh about these writing assignments. first um i don't want you to rely on me to, give you the assignment if you're absent from class. uh partly that's simply a practical matter and that is i only check my email about every third day because i forget i have it so uh uh y- uh you're much more than likely to, uh get no answer from me out of sheer, inadvertence. but also i don't wanna do that uh e- b- even by choice. so what i suggest is that you, think summer camp, did you all go to summer camp? you get a buddy, uh you know you look out for each other so that if you're drowning you have a buddy that'll say hey he's drowning um, so if you miss class and want to find out if there was a writing assignment then i suggest, you not email me, much less call me, but email your buddy. maybe that uh Nick where did Nick go? Nick? he may uh uh, be softhearted, and answer for you but, i'm not going to. so that's my suggestion to you find somebody in the class who'll, who'll uh, do that for you. now secondly i'm about to take up the writing assignments that you did last time, but let me remind you if you have uh, elevated this writing assignment to be one of your formal ones that you want it graded, again designate that with a big uh, uh W at the top, which stands for, writing or, woe is me or will this never end or whatever some W though so that, Nick will know that's, uh, your paper. um, let me then, hand back these this first set Nick did you wanna say anything about these uh? no they were they were look good so far. um, don't be afraid to use the i, um and ha- students are though aren't they? yeah i don't know i sh- i- i remember being taught that  yeah go ahead and use the first person. and you can assume, that your reader has um, is familiar with the text. i mean again with a with a three-page, response there's no real need to get, to get too um, ah expositional with uh, your explanations about plot or, or you know sort of the action, the narrative action of the story so you can just assume straight off the bat that, um your reader has read, the text and yeah it's uh knows who the characters are,  yeah right uh Gail Chadwick? here Mary Jaralin? uh Lillian Heffner? and Shelly Zimford. do y'all remember that that, did you see the story on the news there was some professor i think over at uh Macomb Community College, uh and he was getting in all sorts of trouble for using such profane language an English professor of course, using such profane language so i'm tempted to do that today just riddle my speech with you know all of this profanity and see if they would, give us an X rating. uh okay, uh i had asked you to uh give me your opinion today on a particular topic, um having to do with Christopher Newman's disposition of the letter that uh, comes into his possession from the, the old Marquis... and i wanna take those up now, uh but i also wanted to uh pose one, fact question, for you to answer my, daily factoid, on the same sheet, it's this. uh when Christopher Newman, uh last sees, Noemie Nioche, in London, uh with whom is she walking? huh mhm i thought the passage where um Mrs Bread is talking about the ribbon that she kept like all her life, i mean i thought there must be something going on there, between the two of them between the two of 'em, i mean even if it wasn't, official,  well i thought that, that there was no choice like, as far as his character goes for him to do anything else but burn the letter. because like, he's so, noble, like he's presented as such a noble figure that like, even as i read the last few chapters i'm like yeah right he's not gonna use the letter  yeah  yeah  and he didn't. he was too, what? he was too noble  yeah uh um, maybe he was sort of you know he was, set up there's a scene in which, he meets the Marquis and her son i, can never remember the title, yeah yeah the yeah the young, the young Marquis? yeah the young Marquis, in which um each recognized, the uh talents of the other or the the ingrained nobleness, of the other. well h- he feels that way more about the mother i think doesn't he? he says to the Ma- the the the the titles here are hard, Marquis is the feminine and i guess Marquises is the plural, (jumping in) um and he says to the Marquis uh i would have been your greatest admirer. uh, he in fact he sees some, kinship i think between himself and her, uh that they are you know in the way they're both sort of daring, bold, uh the son is kind of a, a factotum isn't he? kind of a wimp uh yeah his mother's always saying do something he says what? uh you know and he's not he's not a great, figure in the novel i think, but but, Newman does see a kind of_ you wonder if the Marquis had if the roles were reversed and she had a letter she could use on Newman, not too much question she'd have, stuck it in him and twisted it is there? i mean she i- she's a pretty ruthless figure. i mean anybody who would kill their husband over a, question of who shall our daughter marry, and if they disagree, she poisons him uh i mean you know, and, (uh you know) i think in some way, uh James is meaning for us to see her as this great, the, as the French would say um i guess, i thought that, in a way i kinda hoped that he would, tell everybody about it, just because, they were so mean that, you kinda didn't want them to get away with it. that they deserved it. yeah. yeah. um, any of you feel that way? maybe i should have put it in this way if you'd been in Newman's place what would you have done with the letter? uh i think that, throughout the novel, Newman was so built up, to be this noble and great person just in order to, have a shot, at even at even  that, at the end of the novel he c- he had to burn the letter in order, because that was in his character.  okay. okay that- that- he is so good and you know this is what Mrs Tristram says to him right at the end, the Bellegardes never really feared you very much. and that's the reason why mhm? that's that's what i think is so interesting cuz how i read the end was that, after you know, Mrs Tristram says, you know you're a great person they were never (scared at the beginning,) he kinda he looks back that's right  um i also think that, part of it is at the end of the story he's tired. you know? he's, he's endured so much um, action and so much, like injustice, that at the end he comes he only has his himself and his character to draw upon, his past, um and he realizes i think that, um, to act, to disgrace the Bellegarde's name would also be, um to hurt those that he's come to, to love most.    not so much. i mean the- a- a- are you are you saying that that uh, there's still a certain amount of calculation, in what Newman is doing where he says, well, if i did that i would hurt, s- these people or i would hurt myself in this way, rather than it just being this completely, generous, disinterested, which i hope you know doesn't mean uninterested, action on his part? and i think part of it is, a big part of it is calculated just like in the story, even his affections for Claire part of it was calculated. part of it was genuine i think, you know that he actually  yeah yeah, that's right okay l-  i think there was some nobility in uh when he goes to the older lady, um Madame d' Outreville the duchess well he thinks she's just simply being, um, how shall we say it, uh, super subtle, rather cunning. uh le- let me take this up with you just for a second, uh this is in the stage where he still wants to expose the Bellegardes. he's got that letter in his pocket and he's going around, this is the the beginning he thinks of, showing them up for what they are and the first person that he goes to is is is the old duchess, the supposedly the most uh what? venerated figure in, aristocratic France. and he doesn't do it, he doesn't show her the letter. is it because, h- her, the nobility of her character dissuades him...? his own view of this is wh- what do you recall...? she would have believed it. he had no, he didn't doubt that, that she would've believed him. but uh, she would in a sense have closed ranks, with the Bellegardes. she might even later, who knows this is, pure speculation, she might even later have, in some way criticized them. but not to him, not publicly, not to an outsider you see. so that he saw suddenly that he's dealing with uh, people who even if he divulged this information they might indeed think much less of the Bellegardes, but it would always be, contained, within those, private walls of the, of the Saint-Germaine. does that make sense? and he realized in a way, i don't know that_ i don't know how this affects our idea of his nobleness, but he realizes in a way, what's he gonna do with these letters, if not burn them...? was there no, National Enquirer in Paris then? no Hard Copy? no gossip columnist that you know, couldn't you do something with this letter? it's it's, partly it seems as if Newman doesn't have an avenue for his, if he_ although i don't think, that's what James wanted us to conclude. you see, that he didn't expose them because he simply had no means to do it i don't think James wanted us to view it in those terms, but rather to see it as this act of great, magnanimity. there's another problem with this that i wanted to raise with you although in a way it's an illegitimate, consideration, uh, i've always thought, th- tha- that Newman did the wrong thing by burning the letters, because i thought he owed something to the old Marquis. the old Marquis uh gave the letter to Mrs Bread and said uh, uh on page four-fourteen, uh, i think like not only that but i think Valentin wanted him to expose them too cuz he knew      and maybe she wouldn't. but it was that, was it Newman's judgment to make? in other words isn't he burning evidence of a crime, uh purely for his own, moral self-satisfact- as i say i think this is an illegitimate, consideration i've injected here because James doesn't make that really part of the calculus of the novel. but still when i was reading the novel i thought, hey wait a minute you know, mhm there's that conversation about slinging mud, which i thought was really interesting, and there really is no way i mean it's still true today there's no way to sling mud without getting your hands dirty. and so i mean  mhm.   well all i can say is if i were in Newman's place i'd've gone to the police and said um i just actually had a quick question about that scene with the duchess. um, i'm l- trying to, find the page number so, i'm gonna keep talking as i look for it. but like, it seems like, in that s- in that like that scene, the point of view changes like really quick like to her point of view when she says she's gonna act charming, and then like she won't like speak to him again is that like, is that just our imagination- or is that like       well i i think he's, he's uh that that's uh you're right that is an interesting stylistic device because, it's he's gonna give us the motive and then he kind of indicates, Newman wasn't quite sure why he did it. is that the-  therefore she would be charming, uh but she would never see him again. okay yeah you're you're right for a minute at least we are in the duchess's mind. i'll see him i'll see what he w- i'll see what he wants, i'll be charming to him, uh but he's not... he doesn't matter to me i you know i've always wondered if he pulled out the letter and read it what would have been her reaction? i'm always wanting to rewrite people's books for them, terrible fault, um, uh, but when he tries to broach anything she always has ways of what deflecting it, yes um could the end also be a contrast? because it seems like, throughout the majority of the novel, um Newman's built up, you know like his character's built up and you know, he's so persistent and so strong and so invincible, that, maybe at the end, he's presenting a contrast? like i remember reading on four-thirty-eight um, you know, he's talking about h- he had no desire to make acquaintances and, you know, he thought a great deal of Madame de Cintre, he lived over and over again the happiest hours he had known, um he starts to think yes, yes oh he is,  i see your point yeah. no  well perhaps also um, Newman's aggressiveness always came from his self-interest. he always has something to gain by his, solving problems and in this case, he really has nothing left to gain from the situation, that's right.  i'm just you know i- i'm for the noblemen though.  she does  and they talk about that right at the end where he says to her, why did you ever, start this in the first place? was it just, curiosity on your part? and she says uh what? do you remember this? uh, can we get it's very very near the end uh, it's an interesting passage uh, four-twenty-eight. he says to her it kinda seemed like she did it for like her own like entertainment. yeah. yeah. exactly. i don't think (xx) that's what she means by curiosity i just wanted to see what would happen. i don't think that's a good enough reason. yeah. James, the James's fiction is full of people like this. uh i think the greatest of all James novels although, obviously (xx) is Portrait of a Lady. and in it uh, a young man, Ralph Tuchett, manages for his cousin Isabel Archer to inherit a lot of money, a great deal of money, because he says he wanted to see what would happen, to her, in the world if she had, wings to fly anywhere. this money's gonna free her he thinks. give her all this money, i just wanna see what would happen to her. do you do you remember that old show, the the Millionaire? not Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, it used to be, the guy who would go around and give people a million dollars. someone would show up and knock on your door millionaire and say Jean what Tipton Thomas something Ja- well anyway. uh he and, because he just wanted to see, what would this person do if you said they had a million dollars what would this person do? and of course a lot of times the stories were terrible. tha- you know awful things would happen. but they were just satisfying their curios- so Ralph Tuchett in Portrait of a Lady, just wants to see, what will happen to my cousin, if she's suddenly made extremely wealthy? you see, and, pretty awful things happen to her, uh and to some degree that's what's true of Mrs Tristram here. i just wanna see. you remember when he goes to her and tells her about the party he's planning she says uh it's uh what's her first word? odious. it's delicious. you see? it's a terrible party to give. i love it. you you so you know her kind of character don't you? she just likes to see, in a way she likes to cause trouble or you know just, uh, throw the golden apple in the midst of all the people and see how they're gonna fight over it. so yeah i think that she's a she's a fascinating character as a kind of a obser- and if you wanna make it psychological you could say she's bored, you know her husband's a dimwit, she has nothing else to do, so why not just, arrange people's lives, meddle a little, see if i can't cause some, excitement hm? uh uh James says as i say this often, catalyst sort of character who looks and says let's see what will happen if we do such and such. Jean did you have a? i don't know i i was just trying to i wish i could've found the spot then, i mean i, i sorta wanna discount her now, when she talks about how aristocratic it was for the Bellegardes to, you know g- get rid of him in  mhm but was it you know, there was a comment made that she maybe she did she do this, well he was getting at revenge but, wasn't the final straw where she had to escort him    yeah  mine, yours. okay, very good very good. \",\n",
