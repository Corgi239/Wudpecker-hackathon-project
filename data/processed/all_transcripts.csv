LEL175JU154.json	(xx) could i have your attention please? Dr Hammerman do we have any announcements about the exam online or anything like that? uhuh uhuh yeah so practice exam two is on the web and i will put the answers on um, i guess this Friday or Saturday. uh and you know that the, your next exam is Monday from six to eight and it will be in the same room as it was before which i think was fourteen hundred Chem or, wherever it was i'll i'll take a look and, know for sure. and i am trying to get a room for a review session which will be six to eight P-M Sunday evening. um that_ so essentially twenty-four hours before the exam. it will either be here or somewhere else in Chemistry i just don't have that room yet so, just try and keep Sunday evening open for review and Monday evening open for the exam. and try your hand at the practice exam. okay. um also remember that, yesterday's set of lectures are the last ones that are going to be on this second exam. so starting today everything is, else is on the last exam. i also just want to explain what this set-up over here is. i'm i'm not exactly sure how to explain it. i'm being recorded as part of a research project, it has nothing to do with what i'm saying it's because i'm a female and, a lecturer in the, in the sciences. in the sciences. and they collect spoken word. the spoken word. so, it has nothing to do with our class you don't have to worry about it they're not, trying to take your names and addresses or they're_ it's part of a research project it's science. so um, and actually this, this group um recorded a lot of my biochemistry students as they were giving (their) presentations this year so that's how (we) came to be part of this. um i think we, finished up everything yesterday that i wanted to talk about about Mendelian genetics. i did have a couple of questions at the end of class and, one person asked me about eye color genes and i can't remember exactly, who that was but i have some stuff for you, that i can give you later. okay but i didn't know the answer completely and this is what i've got for you. um and i think with that we're gonna go on and we're gonna start talking about, evolution and we're gonna start talking about it in a historical context we're gonna talk about, Darwin and how he came to the ideas that became known as the theory of, evolution by natural selection. and so, the first part of today's two lectures is kind of a historical story about how these ideas all came together. and once again, like when we were talking about Mendel you have to give these guys credit they didn't know any of the stuff that we now know about how genes work. and so all the things that they came up with were quite amazing, in terms of, the complexity and the thoroughness of their ideas. and so, appreciate them from the historical context if you can. um i just s- started out with some pictures here, to just remind you, of the incredible diversity of life, on this planet and, the diversity, of life that has since disappeared. all the things that have gone extinct. i just wanted to give you just a real, quick view and i'll go back to some of those pictures of all the different organisms and, and how, how can we make sense about all these incredibly different organisms? the ones that we've seen the ones that we can't see because they're too small, the ones that we haven't seen yet because we haven't traveled to Australia yet. things like that i i just want you to get, to think about that. because it is as the organizing concept of biology that evolution is so important. nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution one famous evolutionary biologist said. because without this idea of how things change over time and how everything is descended, from, an original organism essentially, without that concept you can't possibly begin to figure out how all this diversity came about. so that's one of the big things about, why evolution is such an important concept and why, it's, it's taught wherever they let us teach it. um, it's also a wonderful illustration of the scientific method, um Darwin's Origin of the Species his book, represented the, one of the first consistent uses of, the standard scientific method. i talked yesterday about how Mendel was also using it as well and Darwin and Mendel were going on about the same time. and so, the question being asked after a pattern is seen, observations made data collected, experiments done, a revision of the original hypothesis, that whole, method of making the hypothesis and then looking, with experiments at what happens and then making new hypotheses all that, was something that Darwin rigidly used in order to come up with his ideas. and as an intellectual revolution, it was also incredibly important and, i do have to preface this by saying that, most of this history i'm gonna be talking to you about is Western histo- history. because it were it was Western ideas that influenced Darwin. um but, coming to the idea of common descent with modification which i'll get to in a minute, was a replacement of all sorts of other ideas that had been going on. and what it means is that we're all part an- of an immense evolutionary tree. we're all part of the same biological story and that was a brand new idea. and it also means that our world is not fixed it is changing all the time and therefore we fit into that world because we are changing all the time and all other organisms are changing. so, those three things about evolution is, is why it's just such a big deal and why you really need to understand it. i'm gonna really briefly touch on some evolutionary thinking before Darwin, um starting very early on. there was a fellow named Thales, and he said that, things had a cause and things had an effect. and that we should be able to explain natural phenomena, things going on in the natural world, um by natural causes. he said there was no need to bring up_ into the story, um sup- supernatural causes, that there were natural causes and natural effects. and, his ideas should have led to Darwin's ideas of, natural selection, but um he was overridden by a much more powerful and popular philosopher at the time, Plato. and Plato is one of these two guys, the other one's Aristotle and i can't remember which one is which. but, you can see them talking about heavy things. and Plato was a huge impediment to the idea, to the development of ideas about natural selection. he was the most influential philosopher of his time and his idea was that every individual thing has an essence, an whoa okay folks. i think i'm gonna, bring us back now. um, so i wanna talk now about micro-evolution, which is usually defined as the mechanism of evolution. um i first wanna make clear a couple of things. um first of all what is it exactly that evolves? i mean we've all talked about how our ideas are evolving or our, our um, our relationships evolve but as biological beings, we individuals, individual organisms do not evolve. in terms of the idea of biological evolution, populations of organisms, are the smallest units that evolve. and the definition of a population, for our use right now and we'll expand it a little when we talk about the ecology of populations but our definition for now of a population is members of a species which we're going to temporarily define a species as interbreeding individuals and their offspring. so members of a species that occupy the same geographic, area. so, a more simple way of putting it is that a population is the same species in the same place and at the same time. okay they have to be able to interbreed for us to talk about (a you know a) situation. so, organisms individual organisms do not evolve but populations do. and we need to think about the fact that while, natural selection works on phenotypes what we're really looking at in terms of the raw material of evolution are genes. um in a population where like let's say primates and one group disperses more than another would there be more genetic variation?    whatever you say Marcie. yeah   	1
LEL295JU035.json	let me ask a question. no yeah the font's too big. yeah but if the font's s- smaller then you can't read it easily. okay this'll do. (work) uh you got something (xx) that wasn't much of a guess. what if you write uh one hundred and seven A B C (xx) tell me what you want? one hundred and seven A B C. one hundred and seven A B C that's actually a good question. what's it gonna do? what if it was, one-oh-A-seven? i'm sorry? one-oh-A-seven? hang on on that one cuz it did something interesting. okay i told you it would do a hundred and seven and it did, hundred and seven is prime, and then it said input a positive integer where was it it was right here, and then suddenly it quit i didn't type anything. (xx) again. hundred and... make it exactly the same hundred and seven A B C. i will hit enter once, it'll tell you a hundred and seven is prime and quit. what did it do? well it saw tho- the digits one zero seven, then it saw something that wasn't a digit but took a hundred and seven as a number, everything was cool, then it went back to read more information. well that A B C doesn't disappear. that A B C was w- sitting there waiting to be read in. it started trying to read a number, immediately got A and it said, this isn't a number, can't read a number. and it stops. okay...? sorry yours was one-oh-A-seven one-oh-capital-A-seven. any predictions? can we go back to the C code (issue) (xx) sure  we need two of these that's what we need. here's the deal... scan-F what if you type a space, between one of those? hang on a second. um, so the point is that scan-F returns a value and this whole bit of text right here, scan-F double-quote percent-I comma ampersand num close-parens that whole thing evaluates to, zero cuz it didn't read anything. one is not equal to zero. that's a true statement so, i get out. something bad happened. i was just asked what if i do this one twenty-three space A B C. any predictions? put in another (xx) (xx) yeah  what? try a decimal. alright. one last test for those who wanna stay. 	1
STP560JG118.json	computer to work. um first we'd like to start with a little activity a little class participation, um, what i want you to do is to, build since our directions aren't on the computer, i'll read them to you. um take your pixie sticks and your marshmallows, to create the best structure possible. use your imagination and be creative. do not trade your supplies.  (you guys get) one more minute thirty seconds guys okay, okay... now, since none of you guys, um realized the fact that you could defy us and collaborate cuz collaborating is    i'm out of a job now you have thirty s- thirty seconds to see what you can do collaborating with your,  really quick okay okay.   nah time's up so. (it's sad) (we will defy you) okay what, what did you guys notice from doing this little activity? we didn't all have the same amount of   you didn't have the same amount of material you had lots of legs we had no time you had no time. some people had all Pixie Sticks and no marshmallows. some people didn't wanna share, their resources. um some people didn't (xx) what this was meant to represent, was, um, with the more resources that you have the stronger, your collaborations can be and the stronger your structures can be. um, pooling with others t- who share similar resources which you all had pixie sh- sticks and marshmallows can lead okay. you guys can eat your food now. so (xx.) we don't have power in the computer right so we don't have our audiovisual presentations for y'alls but, you'll just hafta, hafta go with it, um, so the, with the example of resources and structure, that you're supposed to be using what you have to build your life and that sometimes you know you don't have appropriate materials or you don't have a means of interacting with other people who can help you build that structure for yourself, so we started at a really, um national level about students in the United States cuz our topic is about, women in multiple roles ma- mostly students who are parents. and so in the United States, thirty-two percent of undergrads enrolled across the nation label themselves as independent with dependents, so that's not even counting graduate students that's undergrads alone. twenty-six percent of those students are considered low-income, and fifty-nine percent of those are undergr- are_ of the undergrads are single parents. wow okay. um surprisingly with all of these figures, um, there are r- there's really not a no- a network of support at the University of Michigan. um there are programs that target graduate students but really nothing exists with the exception of a lesbian moms network, um for undergraduates at all. so understanding the environment is pretty critical to um, do we have it now? just about okay. understanding the environment is very critical to our um, our needs assessment of the community, and as Izumi pointed out a few weeks ago, the University of Michigan is a very politicized environment so, we really have to, um, get a good ex- assessment of the major players and their roles of power and all those other things. one of the main people or organizations that we're working with is the Rackham, School. they actually house a lot of the different programs or there is information there available for parents, who are also students. um, it's an umbrella organization that acts as headquarters for many of the graduate programs on campus, and um some of the programs that are available are kids care at home, which provides service for, kids who are sick at home for, um, a fee. family housing, family care resources program. and our contact there is Jane Landow. Jane is the parent advocate for graduate students. and she essentially, serves as a voice for the needs of, students who are also parents. um she's been very very helpful and is very excited about, our findings and really wants to know um, wants to hear our feedback on what the University is doing. our other contact at Rackham is Damon Forthman, Damon is the president of the graduate student government, and just this weekend he sent out an email, trying to um gauge interest for, parents who are also students for like a social, network so people can feel like they belong to the community. the other organization we're working with at the University is the Center for Education, of Women. um, C-E-W provides funding and counseling and support to women students on campus. together C-E-W and Rackham have, recently formed a task force for student parents. their first meeting was actually last week, and this comes out of a study that was done over the last two years, um, on grad student parents and they explored funding accessibility curriculum etcetera. um the results of this study, were basically that parents really want more money they need more money and more resources, and also they feel very isolated from the community, um whether it's within their programs or just the University in general. the last organization we're working with is actually the Women's Center of America. the Women's Center is a new organization as of January two thousand, and they're very willing to implement new programs, which makes this really great for us, um, they're very very flexible about this they're adding new programs currently, and um, so this way we're not forcing any of our ideas upon them they're ready to receive them. and we also wanted to look at issues of community and organizational diversity within the women student parents on campus. and although this particular community shares a common experience of being both student and parent, a wide range of diversity issues come into play. uh for example student mothers at the University of Michigan come from all different racial ethnic religious cultural backgrounds, um as well as socioeconomic levels, and, uh also as well as that they are single parents or two parent if they have family in-state out-of-state what their just personal support systems are in their family. we initially looked at women in multiple roles that included, wife or mother, partner, uh students and employee and we narrowed it down to just, parent and student because it was too broad of a_ too many roles to look at for this time period. and um, the variance of roles in the community of student mothers demonstrates the need for both multicultural organizing as well as diversity among the facilitators of the program. uh the facilitators must consider, these roles that come into play whether this is just a student, and a parent, or whether this is a student an employee, a partner a parent, you need to look at those things. and also you need to be aware of your own status, um, as well i- as the facilitator are you a student parent? are you going to be somebody coming into this group, who has no idea what these kind of role constraints can be? and then, adapt yourself and your presentation to be, there as strictly a facilitator and not somebody to say, i'm in, you know the same boat as you tell me how you're feeling oh that's that's terrible that's too much. um, it's also important to examine the cultural and religious beliefs of the particular group of student mothers that you are working with. for example, um, African women maybe international students who come there, a lot of African cultures women carry their babies constantly even up to like two years old on their chests or back, and how you need to be aware of that and say well maybe you wouldn't be so constrained in your roles if you put your baby down for a little while and did your housework and and then you need to understand that that's how these women do everything, and not, try to say that that's a bad thing for their children to be you know visibly attached to them, twenty-four hours a day. and also, for religious and cultural backgrounds there may be outside, role constraints, coming from a particular religion or culture, inflicted on the woman for being a student, while they're a parent. so you need to look at those issues as well. and always be aware of your bias and privilege when working with (xx) you might wanna move a little bit so that people here can see the slides. um i'm gonna talk about methodology what we're planning to do and how we're planning to do it. um, we are_ actually last night we initiated our first contact to get to, um parents who are also students, and we did this via email, um emailing different, um departments and different schools within the University of Michigan. and as of like three hours ago, we'd already received nine, answers of people who wanted to participate so this is obviously, a real concern, for people in the University of Michigan. um within that email we, stated that we would have these_ ask them what days would be, most accommodating for them what nights what evenings what mornings. um within the next month or so, and also we told them that we would have child care and refreshments provided which formed an incentive, for them to come to the focus groups. um, when they get there, we are going to, have like a one page survey questionnaire, um about what kinds of services they know about currently that the University of Michigan is providing, have they ever accessed those services? um do they have any recommendations or suggestions about things that would be useful to them as a parent? um things like that. we're also going to target with the survey, um a mass meeting that's being held at Rackham next week, so that we would get a wider range of answers, for our questions. um, and our focus groups, um refreshments and child care provided um will hopefully be eight to ten participants, um from diverse educational and, socioesh- economical and, um racial backgrounds. that the University represents. um, we've already actually gotten, one man who responded so, we already_ i know we have a little bit of diversity in there. um, we'll have a facilitator from our group and, a recorder, um and then someone who will watch the kids, um, and the groups will be organized according to like what time they requested. um would be good for them so it's very, um participant-friendly, focus groups. um, and our analysis is gonna be a content analysis of the dialogue, um picking out what things are important what quotes, as well as a trend in (classes.) um, which we hope will be helpful. and these results we will give back to Rackham, um as well as the Center for Education of Women and the Women's Center, who are all really anxious to see what these women and parents, um want and need in this University... um the work being collaborative, um one thing that we've really learned already, in this is that's it's very hard to target one organization, because, um, of the very nature of our project the women's multiple roles, in that, as multiple roles they're not only mothers but they're students as well and their lives are touched by different organizations that can help and provide resources. so we're trying to, um coordinate those different organizations and, see how we can help them and how they can help, the parents, within the University. um, and each agency knows and supports us in that we're talking to other, agencies that share the concern about parents who are also students. so. do you guys have any questions about our project or what we're doing? mhm? is it for_ are you targeting everybody or um, graduate students or undergrads? i didn't hear what you said both both. everybody. okay we're still waiting for the okay, to send out a mass mailing to undergrads. oh okay yeah is there any aspect that you wanna t- uh get feedback from? (xx) from the people? um, i would think possibly like what_ if you guys have any suggestions about how to, um, best, um go about forming with the collaboration between, the different agencies and the parents as well, and us, cuz we're students as well so, do you guys have any suggestions? do you mean as far as just getting the meeting to org- like an organizational meeting (xx?) i'm not sure (what you're asking) that's a good i- well, that's a good idea getting people within e- each organization, to meet together yeah we don't have one set up but that would be good. (i don't know if you) could do a community forum type thing, where you could have representatives from each organization there and have all of them talk about their services what they have and then have the community, of of single, parents in this case, come up and give testimony on what they'd like to see and that way you've got representatives of_ appropriate representatives as well of all of your organizations that are (listed,) directly that sounds great does the University have data about which students have kids and which don't? no?   they they, in answer to our question about that they don't have enough funding, uhuh one of the problems that i've had is i i wanna focus on the diversity among the group and i can say that i know that student mothers are different ethnicities and religions and, whether they're partners or wives or whether they work but i can't back that up with any numbers cuz they're just not there. supposedly there's a proposal sitting on the provost's desk right now so that they can start, collecting this information, but it just hasn't gone through yet. it's, it's one more line item on the questionnaire you know it just seems it's sort of standard  it'd be interested_ it'd be interesting also to know like if the, majority of students that have_ especially undergrad, like are traditional students or more nontraditional and are older and have come back. like i wonder,   mhm age of the kids might also be important. i think at W-C-C (xx) you might have a lot of much younger children, whereas here at U-of-M i would suspect that you have an older female demographic that has gone back and might have kids at home, but, they're not you know one two toddlers etcetera. yeah that's actually been another thing that the University looked into um because there isn't a lot of support for part-time graduate students some programs don't even offer it, so you would assume that the part-time students would be the ones with the really young kids. cuz they couldn't be there full-time, so they were looking into that too how how to make things more accessible for those, type of people. just to go along with what Joanna suggested about community forum, um there are brochures that um i think Rackham puts out, and uh list listing different resources for student parents. but one i wonder how much, uh how well that's distributed. um so these student parents may not know about the resources, to begin with. um two so that the community forum could be part you know um resource fair you know where agencies or units or uh child care agencies around the area or public school officials whatever, come together and present what they do or where parents can walk around and get the brochures and stuff, and last half second half of that could be hearing from the parents themselves um okay this is great that there are these services but what about this and what about that? so i think there's the two issues that the University doesn't know the issues but also parents are so overwhelmed or so busy that they don't have time to get around and (xx) hopefully we'll we'll get to some of those questions by the survey. that we'll, that we'll send out to, we might (get answers) to some of those. hopefully. information's been a problem. like in both directions because a un- the University can't ask on like your application for admission, you know if you have kids or if you're married those are all, you know taboo questions so unless they have money to fund a follow-up project for th- those kind of questions then they're not gonna get asked and then, you know each of the centers that we've talked to have a web page or some information resources but they aren't linked to each other so there's no network, so they're not really having a good dialogue interacting and then like on the Rackham page, it has a list of services for students but a lot of them'll be headed under, like for the Family Housing so if you're not in Family Housing you can't access these services you you have to like pick and choose which services are available to you and, and it gets really complicated, to even figure out, you know what am i eligible for? so that information has been a really big problem in this whole_ which is why we wanna make sure our information is available to more than one, group we don't want them to_ everyone to get the jump on it or whatever and try to duplicate services but we want everyone to know what we discover s- to help alleviate some of this information, lag. well maybe if like, you get a lot of responses, hopefully to your email that um, and you can't include all those people in both of the focus groups for like logistical reasons or whatever maybe you can send all the people that responded to the the survey at least or something. did you get any reaction around the issue that you know you are M-S-W students for example there are some other M-S-W students who are parents and, sort of feel weird about going to you, to talk about issues. um, i've gotten a- the emails but i haven't responded yet to them cuz, i've been in class all day, um and i noticed one o- one of 'em was an M-S-W student and a couple of 'em were, from, doctoral students from biopsych and, so a couple_ a lot of 'em are probably gonna have more education, you can now eat your Pixie Sticks if you haven't started already thank you (people) next week we gonna have guest speaker Anne Walt, who gonna talk about the uh, her experience working with the women's organization in Rwanda after genocide. so that's gonna be very interesting, um especially for those of you who want to do international work or want to work with a non-profit organization, you know like trans-cultural organization. so that's that's one agenda, um... and i s- please bring back that stack of paper i gave to you today. and you can look through them and if some of them may (xx) programs for example there is defining community and there is a couple handouts that you can peel out if that's useful to your assignment you can do that part of as part of your paper (xx) so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna, fill you in briefly about um some of our issues and some of our central strategies and tactics, how we're gonna focus more than on um, processing what occurred when we met with the program co- coordinator of Generations last evening and some issues that, arose from that conversation. however on the board there's a brief outline of what we're gonna do. we're just gonna, i'm gonna, introduce the program real quick, do the five issues, and then Theresa's gonna chat about the strengths, and limitations that we see of the strategic plan that we created for Generations, and then um, Jessica and Jason are gonna um, talk about, the um meeting that we had with the program coordinator last night. um, like you guys know Generations is a program that deals with, children who um, either have a parent or guardian um, in prison, or um have a parent or guardian or close relative that, is um at risk for um, i guess falling_ committing crimes. um, as you know we work closely with the program coordinator in terms of learning about the organization learning where they are now where they would like to go. and that helped us, in a sense develop, and come up with the issues that are currently affecting Generations and essentially create our strategic plan. we really wanted to focus on improving the quality of the programming for the children at Generations. so by um, doing that, we wanted to address, the children's needs and assets, um in- while we were trying to create a street plan all at the same time. so, we came up with five issues, um that we felt that, Generations could look at and hopefully address and then, improve upon. the first issue was that, Generations, we needed to know what are Generations' program goals, and how does Generations intend to achieve these goals. like you heard about last time um, they're really_ they have a mission and vision statement however they're, in the, process of revising it. so um, we suggested that they do that so that was an example of one of our um, strategies, for that issue and then the second issue, was how can Generations strengthen the relationships between the tutors and the mentors, and um, with Generations and the Generations staff and then the second element was that, how can the tutors and mentors improve their relationships with the children. so we suggested that Generations look into, creating and implementing an orientation and training specifically for the tutors, and that they hold dialogue sessions several times throughout the year so that tutors can come in and talk candidly with um, the program staff. our third issue... (xx) is, how can Generations improve the diversity among its tutors and mentors? and that was a big, thing at when we spoke last time, and it was great because we were able to take, a lot of your feedback and bring it back to the program coordinator we even suggested in that paper especially um project outreach, and also incorporating some of the retirement communities and trying to recruit, through the mentors from there to increase the diversity of the tutor mentor population so we suggested that as one of our um, tactics. the fourth issue which we spoke in detail about, during our last presentation was how can Generations determine the needs and assets of the children, throughout their involvement in the program. and um, as you can remember we, wanted_ we suggested that they were to develop, um an educational biopsychosocial assessment, and that they were to_ gonna administer that to the students, to the children. and then our final issue dealt with, evaluation, and, how can Generations evaluate the success of its program. and basically we suc- we suggested_ cuz right now currently they have_ they know by um, i guess s- subjective comments that come through they really don't have any objective measures currently to um see how the program, is functioning so we suggested that they, administer surveys and questionnaires on a regular basis to the tutors and the parents and the guardians and the children of the program. and that one's kinda tied into the first one of the whole mission because if you don't really have your mission your goals how can you even evaluate yourself? if you don't have, what you're trying to do, mhm so basically, our whole focus was to, in our strategic plan like we suggested these strategies and tactics and we, came up with these issues and we involved Joanie a lot in it. in addition when, we presented it to Joanie and said here, you know if you t- what you can take from this, take it run with it, but try to include the children try to include the tutors and mentors and then if you read our paper we tried to, suggest ways that, everybody could be equally involved in implementing the strategic plan. and in terms of when would the implemation implementation occur, most of the stuff would be slated for like fall two thousand (like) they're running through they, they run the academic year so in a sense, you know they're already started this year we have a lot of great ideas, and a lot of the planning and the prework can begin now however, m- the most of the implementation will occur in the fall so i'm just gonna briefly talk about the agency's strengths and weaknesses that we've found. um first and foremost i think that Generations had, really good community spor- support, and in talking with Joanie um, last night and going over some things with her, she shared with us that the Junior League, um the the local one in Ann Arbor, donated twenty-five thousand dollars to their agency. so that is just one example of, the positive community support that they have at this agency. um, the other strength is, their relationships with the universities around the surrounding area, not only U-of-M but Eastern, uh they do get their tutor mentors from them and they also do get their interns, so that's a positive relationship. we also thought that a strength of Generations was their leadership, um, and their openness and willingness to change. like we said Joanie has been involved in this process um, every time you know we turn in a paper, she's very willing she wants to see it right away, see what we've come up with, so sh- herself, she is very open, to new ideas she wants to implement something um, to increase the effectivene- effectiveness of the agency. and, that also goes with, the agency as a whole. they all really work together um, so, that was definitely one of their strengths. some, areas for growths or weaknesses that they had um, were the fact that we're outsiders, implementing you know, this plan, and, this was done relatively quickly we only had a semester to come up with this. some uh, side issues um, with that time frame, was the fact that, you know last night she kinda mentioned to us, cuz we had handed out surveys to the kids and, she was, kinda looking for a um, a statistical analysis of the surveys that we did. and we didn't do that we did you know look at the surveys and you know we get the comments from_ but we were not going to do a whole, statistical breakdown. and, that was just a part of, the short time period that we had. so. um... also, with the surveys um one of the limits that we had was the age thing. with the younger kids it was hard to use, questionnaires where, you know they, could write down kind of an open-ended question it would really stick to yes no questions. um, also, some other limitations, was that Generations only has two um, paid staff, and Joanie the program manager is only there, um part-time. so. and our last weakness um of the agency was the high turnover rate for tutors and mentors, and also with the interns. you know they're only there for a semester and then they leave. so, that's what we found um, for the strengths and weaknesses (of Generations.) as far as our plan goes. mhm right as far as you know anything, right um another thing that we suggested to her was, you know to find tutors and mentors or even, um some volunteers to come in occasionally from retirement centers, where there's you know a majority of, people that're, um looking to provide activities for themselves and also to help out other people. she was, initially not very receptive to this because, her impression and no- from what we understood is she had tried this before, and that the people that she had had from retirement centers, they were o- they were older which is which again retirement centers_ and they weren't very assertive, she didn't think that they could, control the type of kids, that she has in her program. um, we, you know i- tried to sort of, sway her in that, you know, retired people aren't necessarily little old ladies who are pushovers, but they can really be, good influences on these children's lives. um so hopefully she does that, she'll look into that but, you know again we don't know. also we suggested to her, that she look to local businesses, uh have her interns you know look to local businesses and, see if maybe they can find some, um volunteers some tutor mentors from uh you know the professional world. um, again she was, she thought this was a good idea but also that you know if they were gonna do it that, they would have come to her and i just kinda suggested to her that sometimes people just need a, you know personal invitation, and so hopefully she'll look at that. also another suggestion that, that we had is, my internship right now, um is at a summer camp and one of the programs i run is for uh E-I children and E-M-I children and, so sh- i gave her the uh phone number and she's gonna call and look about maybe getting scholarships, for one or two of her kids, so that they have an opportunity and so that their parents or m- actually specifically for a child if she (has it in) foster care, as an opportunity to try something else. could you explain what E-I and  emotionally impaired and educably mentally impaired okay thanks. sorry sorry but so all of this came out of even just the presentation portion of it. so, that was kind of interesting. i don't know i d- think in a way we wish we woulda utilized, Professor Rottmal's, her whole schedule of how to have this thing, just, i guess in conclusion i think, we really appreciated working with her it was kind of a nice mutual relationship where she felt like she, gained something by having us working with her so w- we didn't feel like we were just bombarding her and just using her and just, like sucking everything from her, mhm mhm any questions? i just wanna say that it s- kinda seems like you guys, were able to come in and, like pinpoint something that needed to happen and kind of help them think like horizontally about it, you know? like it really kind of of like, shone some light into like, ways that the program could improve and things that needed possibly changing and, it seems really   and it kind of sounds to me like, you know the things that you proposed to her, that she was having similar problems concerns about it that, and what that says to me is you know maybe, the only thing that, can really be done at this point is like she needs to really take a look at her internal structure  yeah mhm   i think that's why she loved that um, project outreach idea even more though cuz you know mhm mhm um, Ebony and a- i Ebony and i actually worked for, an organization on campus that does like tutoring and mentoring can you speak up? sorry. Ebony and i worked for an organization on campus that does mentoring and tutoring for elementary school kids and high school kids and, um, i don't know if one of those I-P students is a coordinator for the tutors and mentors, is that, their responsibility or not  mhm that's true right      so, yeah  that was a really good idea though. yeah it's been_ i don't know if it's been the same at at Pioneer but, i don't know. yeah, (that's good)       rock on. okay, alright (xx) kay group, five. is the computer working?  Becky it is working? it is working. thanks. oh it's not break time yet is something wrong...? impossible. it was working do you wanna push this over here? what number are you guys? five go five, it's your birthday  if it's okay, we can get started, so then we can go, there's gonna be a break after our presentation, so, okay group group five. five    what? i thought you said it worked oh actually, let me do it. you want this? is it my turn? mkay. i'm gonna talk about um, why our action plan is needed. we identified three reasons why we definitely need to um address this issue. the first is the need to increase under-representeded, under-represented people, of color in the health profession. and currently, approximately only ten percent, of practicing health professionals are minorities. and that's a low number considering that um, in the mid-twenty-first century fifty fifty percent of the people in the United States (will) be minorities. so that's a low figure. um the second reason is the public private partnership momentum. sorry. um, alright so i'm gonna get into who, who was involved in the planning kinda like just (playing,) coming off of what Ebony was saying, is the whole p- um whole program staff is Linda, Kingman which is the program director, yeah. Joy Canton which is uh the program coordinator um, and we was us, all tryi- going to the meetings and observing what (there) was going on with the kids, the tutoring sessions and especially, Angie like she said that is her placement as well as the whole parents and par- and her parents representative. which, was partner representative which they have other partners they they partners like Ministers' Alliance of Washtenaw county very involved, and the N-double-A-C-P in Willow Run very involved with this program and U-of-M, is very involved so, they do have a lot of partnership representatives of, the university. the one thing that was kind of interesting to me was that Saint Joe's is not very involved but, that's something they have to look into, in that partnership so. well what we found in our assessment our program opportunities is that, we have um more visib- more visibility could strengthen, the partner, relationship and program attendance that's the opportunities they can_ that we can they can take, as well as graduate assistant staff can provide program staff the support necessary to strengthen the dormant relationship. the dormant relationship that we found was mostly the relationship they have with the parents, in the community because HOPE, is, mainly a pro- is a, is a partnership of, HOPE, and the children in, or the the high school is in, Ypsi. and one thing about it is that the kids come (with) their parents. and we want them to be involved in a sense because we want them to strengthen whatever they learn at HOPE at home. and they don't know what's happening then. that was one of the things that we feel like that's a opportunity they really need to strengthen is their involvement in their children's life. cuz that also will empower them as they go on, and as that anything else happens in school they will know exactly what's happening with their children and they won't be so dormant about it. and then the program threats is there's only two more years left in the pro- in the program grant. cuz this is a five year grant, i believe. mhm i'm gonna talk about the uh, health program action plan and basically, what Makeba was saying that we were trying to get more parent involvement into the programs and, a workshops facilitator guide, which will um, assist them in effectively, communicating program gro- program goals and the promotion of activities that encourage (HOPE) students and their retention. um some of the expected outcomes, mkay (xx) questions? any um, questions?   oh, okay (unless you guys aren't going) oh, the evaluation. okay, so what we were looking at in terms of the evaluation was in using the parent involvement plan to really start kind of i- really to be a framework to evaluating, how effective the um, the program is. if we're looking at trying to, essentially make the program sustainable, um looking at planning beyond just like, like Makeba talked about planning beyond, the next two years of the program grant, and using that time to really help substantiate the significance of this program in Ypsiliti, Ypsilanti school district, is we work with Ypsilanti High and two, um middle schools in Ypsilanti so, um you have a great opportunity for that population in grades six through twelve, to really start to be, a core group of um, really strong uh health-oriented students to go and matriculate into the health occupation so, the program evaluation, as designed right now would be, an assessment based on, how the kids attend the different components there's three different components and several activities under the three components. um looking at the youth attendance overall their MEAP scores which is the Michigan Educational Assessment Program it's the only standardized test that's given, to all students, in the state of Michigan that measures social studies math science and writing. so, using those scores to kind of have a more, um standardized, reliable and valid measure, to look at that, as well as their cumulative grade point scores, and their marking period scores over the academic year, and then doing a pre-test post-test um summative um, question type scale, that's like a a an a type of Likert scale, um to really start to evaluate their overall participation and, how they've, improved the academic achievement, how they've become more involved in the community or how they've been um, how they've responded to exposures to community involvement, and um, how they've gotten demonstrated interest in health careers. so we're looking at kind of like a_ the way (xx) are right now is like a fifteen month plan starting in April through next, or June two thousand and two. so, that's kind of a description of it, and it would be a non-equivalent comparative program component um group design. so, that's the way it's established right now. um, and that's the, the evaluation part. so, that's really pretty much, the gist of the presentation uh, Joe has a question then we'll go for more. um, when did you say the funding ends for this?         mhm why   mhm     there we go. i got it. ah, and my eyes are dry too this is crazy.  (xx) computer science  yeah this is a stupid petty comment or question um, about the evaluation process and looking at MEAP scores just out of curiosity you know i know there's been a lot of talk about, how the scores are biased because of um, you know how much money a school system has and that mhm mhm there's, MEAP scores for the students from, i'm trying to remember i think last year. last year in the f- i think from ninety-seven until, last year. mhm mhm mhm mhm  mhm  mhm mhm one last comment um, i was wondering why Wayne State, University is not there. and i hear_ uh my girlfriend is in uh medical school there and she says it's the most diverse medical school in the country oh is it?    mhm     mhm yeah,    yeah yeah, that's true. and maybe i don't know how they're doing, explaining their projects out that way or whatever, but  mhm okay, great um, well th- we're gonna take a break, but i was wondering who can take a class picture, while Jun Yeun is here? (who has extra hand?) no. i don't take pictures.  yes. okay,      is it okay? or sure. okay let's, do it 	1
OFC105SU068.json	right. here uh the clipboard. that i ga- okay there. um on the, clipboard is, what i came up with um, at three-thirty in the morning last night. uh, because, i was, sort of reading through the last chapter again where i was talking about, um, folk music and how to sort of nuance that view an- and see um, rap music and then, what i, realized then was that i want to um, explain s- sort of say, this is why they could have come under criticism this is why they were doing sort of uh making a cultural faux pas but then at the same time um, it's absolutely not surprising at all they were accepted by the, um, rap canon thing they moved on because they had not only um, talent and flow, but also um, that, um not all rap is political or has to be community-building or has to to, has to mean anything RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED three RESTRICTED right. th- chapter two sort of sets up, um, the, how rap sort of has fit into the heavily guarded, folk being in quo- cul- in quotes uh folk culture of, of previous black musics um but then, um, chapter three i wanna sorta spend, tearing some of that down or at least complicating it with, um, with the truth which is that the truth being that you know, it doesn't matter, your background you don't even necessarily need to, um be from the street to uh, to be, accepted and understood. that yes, skin color definitely does matter RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED so how do i measure, RESTRICTED so how do i, fix that? because i i feel as though, what i wanna, say is is talk about um, i mean certainly that there is a sort of, level of um, i mean they they still continue to sell records they still RESTRICTED c- uh, the Beastie Boys c- RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it was presented to them by Chuck D and Public Enemy. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED so, i- but i i think that like nonetheless that there's something that i'm grasping at there which is to say that they have, stuck around longer than oth- any other white rappers. they have sold more records more than any other white rappers they have um made more, f- they have more friends who rap, and rap, they have more rapper friends and they have more producer friends and they they have more ties in the, rap recording RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah oh i c- i completely understand what i what i'm, what i'm having difficulty with then, is to um RESTRICTED okay is somebody at the door? RESTRICTED thanks. RESTRICTED i was wondering RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah yeah RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED yeah, i'm taking four other classes so, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED no RESTRICTED unless it's me RESTRICTED 'm'm RESTRICTED i don't think you have to RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED thank you RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED well thank you for RESTRICTED thank you. RESTRICTED it's just RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yes. um i, like read a lot for that and then, wrote a lot and whatever and and sort of uh you know, um, you know ate and slept and r- and and RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i i can't articulate what i'm trying to say i guess what i'm trying to, w- what i mean is that like, all of this, makes a great deal of sense to me but i always feel like, eh, almost as though what i'm trying to say, like i- is either a book, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i- it's, it's not a question of asking too much i- it's a question of um, i- it's, and people who write about music sort of continually have to cover every base. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED when i RESTRICTED okay. th- so RESTRICTED if i write this and then sort of, say a- a- and uh, i- i- um do you remember there's a paragraph in chapter two where i said you know i, st- sort of stepped back and said i race to to note here, that um, that when i'm talking about, you know black musics or when i'm talking about a, uh i- you know music of, or black or white America, i in no way mean to overgeneral- generalize or imply that you know all blacks are poor living in the RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED what part doesn't? RESTRICTED you don't see the the commercial part as as, being indicative of anything? RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED are you kidding? uh well, okay. RESTRICTED i don't think she's the best singer i think that RESTRICTED i i think that um, the, style in which she's doing her music and the, instrumentation and and the um, the, her hispanocentrism, i think is something which is unusual, and it RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED great RESTRICTED should we anticipate a quiz on Thursday RESTRICTED okay RESTRICTED okay you would give two quizzes in the same week? RESTRICTED oh okay i was gonna say RESTRICTED okay thank you. RESTRICTED see you RESTRICTED yeah. i guess i RESTRICTED i think that the Beasties, what's, what surprises me about them is though, uh that everything they've done is so good. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED right but not, what i'm saying is not RESTRICTED no. what i'm saying is is that not everyone gets the, the Video Vanguard Award. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED deeply compromised source of recognition sure but what i mean is is that uh, they do give airplay to people who are crap but at the same same time um they, you know the people who sort of, make it to the upper echelons of of their you know legendary status Madonna, uh, you know who are the people who've gotten the award? uh Madonna Michael Jackson Guns N' Roses, Tom Petty, uh, i forget a couple other people. um, but, you know these are all people who who have actually been putting out quality work that they_ it's it's not as though M-T-V wouldn't know quality if it hit 'em in the face, it's that um they amidst all this other, garbage that they're spewing out, you know twenty three hours a day, um there are people there who know what they're doing you know and and uh, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i disagree RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i mean i- it's sort of like if you watch um, Total Request Live versus watching uh, something, any of his special reports or any of the Rockumentaries that he used to put RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED more than once? RESTRICTED really? especially_ uh even in terms of of her, message and RESTRICTED just_ right but i think that the RESTRICTED right but Shania Twain the, codes are inextricable from her music i think. i mean you listen to, th- to to her albums and it it's not, um it's not very deeply entrenched. you see what i'm saying? you don't have to dig, very deep to to, um, you know a- and s- and so when that's, in the lyrics you can't you can't just say that like well the music's completely different from her message because the two are, RESTRICTED Shania's Twain songs? RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED um, okay. RESTRICTED Dr Dre RESTRICTED right. right but i'm st- the RESTRICTED RESTRICTED although that's a whole other can of worms. RESTRICTED alright. um RESTRICTED okay. and now what i'm also worried about is is that uh, is just, in all honesty i am um, this has sorta ha- been my priority all semester, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED t- well not too much but i- i- just, proportionally too much. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED right. um RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED which uh even there is a i mean what i so what i'd like to do is finish this chapter and then um, i mean i- i- if, if we spend all of, November and December, editing, rehashing whatever i s- i, almost like i- i- it um, and you know i could be entirely wrong about this or overly optimistic, but i sort of feel like then i would be, done with those few chapters by Christmas break RESTRICTED RESTRICTED no no i mean here with this thesis RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED well and then in January, i- does it mean that i get January through, i mean i- should i plan to have, January through um, April to, uh to have it done and you know maybe tweak slightly but not, work as hard? am i am i working on that or i- because i sort of_ that's something that you and i haven't talked about RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED okay. RESTRICTED can we shoot to have to sort of complete, everything and and then in December and then RESTRICTED okay RESTRICTED okay. because RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED well RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED right and and just sort of say this is, you know call it what you want to, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED i so i wanna sort of divest myself of that. um RESTRICTED just_ ach also uh, there was something else i was gonna tell you and i can't remember. RESTRICTED no RESTRICTED i uh i went and saw Martin Sexton and RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah. so well somebody surprised me with tickets and we had front row. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i'm twenty-one now RESTRICTED so, we, had this RESTRICTED not at all. so uh, so we, we you know we had to eat in, the space of fifteen minutes to, then make it over to the to the theater and there was no way we were gonna leave without you know paying we paid for, twelve dollars worth, we were gonna, drink it all so the RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED what the new one? RESTRICTED is it good? RESTRICTED really. RESTRICTED is it? RESTRICTED i've, i've been still been listening a lot to uh to, Macy Gray RESTRICTED you're enjoying it? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED the uh_ you know her voice it's like a preview record of what it would be like if uh Lauryn Hill and Tom Waits had a baby. (if they) RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED anyway RESTRICTED alright well i'll have more soon and uh, i'll leave it in your box if you wanna look RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED because i am budgeting all my own time and sort of like i explained this to all my teachers. (xx) it's just like i need a a class where they say, write a one-page response paper to this thing, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED 	1
COL385MU054.json	this lecture uh, we are very pleased that the Undergraduate Mathematics Society, has uh sponsored uh this lecture uh to uh, uh explain about the solution of what is perhaps the, oldest unsolved problem in mathematics, and uh i want to remind everyone that there is a reception following the, lecture in the mathematics atrium which is uh in the south atrium in uh, this building a few articles published in the last few months, uh, last week, the New York Times, ran an article about mathematics, with the title um if anyone has any questions i'm sure that Professor Hales would be happy to entertain a few brief questions, and um, don't forget there's also the reception, right through those doors to the right, afterwards, thanks, for coming everyone 	1
LAB175SU032.json	last time. right in the mouth. in the mouth why? (structure) cuz of all the structure, all the, macrophytes there underneath the surface (the chirate) and so on. so you actually know where to find the fish. don't forget to put the new people to work.  yeah, we actually could take another one if you want. hello? very weird... so you (assume) that Jennifer decided not to come with us? uh she had to go_ they they the reason they were coming up here was because they had a family wedding in Traverse City. oh oh so she hadn't visited the U-of-M yet? no. but she deferred admission but we have had long conversations though. a lot of um, talking. this is easy going compared to those marshes. (xx) well it's a little like, Mismer and Prentice marsh i think. no no it's not_ it's softer, but it's still got a nice bottom. no i m- Prentice and McKay. had a fairly s- firm bottom. yeah but it was like sandy it was different. yes it was sandy this is muckier. this is muckier. they had more (xx) yeah this is quite a nice little marsh isn't it really? there's not actually that much typha in Mismer. i'm not surprised, that Mismer marsh is fairly complete. yeah it is but i'm just saying i don't think it's as, there's not as many nutrients so you don't find the  yeah, as you do in the other ones. now Heather is uh getting um, i- is working down in the county offices today isn't she? i have no idea i   yeah, sure. mm. a Wednesday. ahh sure do we need my kill jars too or are we gonna go to a different spot? i think we_ i would suggest only one set of kill jars so that we're not lugging too much gear around just make it simple whoops, leaning over here. (alright) yes... (xx) lemme see, yeah it's gone eleven. it took a long time to get out here. yes. we coulda been there and back (xx) um, well i wanted to keep close i_ the weather is a little iffy. no i was (xx) (up to there.) i have a bucket full. i think we can probably make do with one kill jar. (i'll) bring the other bucket. oh okey-doke. isn't there a fish in there already? i don't think so. oh i (guess there is.) there's a (pike.) (i thought i) (xx) (it's alright.) (make sure we've got) (xx) set for, for Tuesday. (yes) (xx) yeah, i decided that having heard that. (xx) there's time. um, on the, the lab exam, if we can use it to look at more process questions okay in addition. and what th- you're not allowed to sell these secrets of the exam okay? uh and what fish are we gonna give them to (key) out? um i haven't decided yet (xx) they're go- they're gonna be the unknowns. hm? they're gonna be the unknowns. i yeah, (xx) find find (all of them.) and we have the (spot fins?) yeah. how many Amia do we have? (i mean we caught a lot of 'em.) are you not writing field notes today Jay? huh? no. hmm. i got mine on the boat. they're al- so long as they're contemporary. they're already written. so, is it okay if i just make a copy of that that map? yes, ex- absolutely since we've been here before we don't need an additional sketch map. but you probably might want to, um annotate or add to the sketch map with  okay right right. um s- oh absolutely. um at the moment the, oh absolutely the air temperature is is is gonna be lower than the water temperature. because of the thermal capacity of water, it's a terrific buffer. okay okay okay okay and the the does it like depth um, in terms of, yes? yes. ye- no still still record the depths. okay  i'll, uh yeah    really? that's a good idea. um one east. (is it?) yes, yeah. probably north-east. (north-east) and it might be force two. yeah? there are certainly no, white caps yet, so it's not force three, but there are there are some, larger ripples, so it's probably force two, okay yeah okay um, i don't remember the,  this kind of weather, um the, barometric pressure, is low, uhuh (for) okay hey good job getting your notes, written up. don't forget to do some fishing as well. (xx) i beg your pardon? (xx) oh really? yeah  they're sluggish today. oh i was just thinking you know (xx) that a- at this time of the term that they know what to do. they do know what to do but they are sluggish today. it's the weather and, yeah well (they) (xx) you don't have wet hands yet. oh really? i love that scent. mm  i'd like you to do a second run and uh, teach Janine, to seine. good, good. hey, God, damn it you (xx) what? (slacker) no we're not keeping we're gonna count them, we'll we'll yes put them in the bucket. i i would like a complete count and so on of the fish as usual in   i don't know.   like there's less water, cuz i don't remember it being so shallow. it is shallower, and the scirpus has grown in so there's a lot more cover. and i think you're getting a wider variety of fish. yeah (and i-) but i, (like) we didn't ge- we didn't get this many small fish. no, ah but you also didn't get as many large fish you didn't get the, the Largemouth Bass. you get any Mudmouth last time? Jay yeah. did you bring a (xx) no. (xx) i left it on the dock. oh alright (I figure there's not sense in bringing xx) are we still recording? are we still recording...? come and grab a net. come and grab a net. it looks different here is it different or not? why do you think it looks different? i don't know (just) thicker? i don't know. it is different it's shallower the water level has dropped uh, i think as much as a couple of feet. really? think there's some more, (some more) (xx) yep the macrophytes here, i think it's (kyra) is it? some of it is p- and (popomategetans) those have those have grown in, since we were here last. i think (Luann) you'll need to annotate the earlier map, and show the new features, the the shallowness here is yeah so we've got the sandbar, got much more (kyra...) look at that those uh, water lilies are, exposed. yeah. hm. not very. okay. good job we (xx) in the collection. um (yo- you can pick a) number? (xx) (i think) about twenty (xx) Carrie do you wanna give it another go? yeah, but no yelling. no yelling. could you uh teach, Carrie, to seine? (to, what?) to seine. i can't remember your buddy's name. Matt? it was Matt okay, the other one wasn't_ oh the other one was Brett that's right, that's what's confused yes, okay i'd like um you to show Matt and Brett how to seine. Matt is that, um, skimming the water? we're not skimming the water we're g- wanna get it into the water these these will teach you how to seine, yeah. Matt. Matt.  no they_ you're gonna_ you can describe how to do it, and it gives you the opportunity to shout keep the (leadline) down. um (but) keep away from the private property so we need to go through there. we haven't w- (went) through there have they? i don't think anyone has been out onto the, island there. wanna go on the other side of the island? sure. this little window here is a s- just one section that, is owned by the station, at the entrance of (xx) i keep forgetting you've, you've been up here, yes. but it's one of the best places on the, lake usually to seine (xx) because of all the cover and the weeds and getting into the entrance of (Bessel) Creek. um, there're a lot of perch in the scirpus, but we can't get them. really? well it's (draining, draining fen) isn't it? um, no it's actually (xx) (connection rather to) (xx) is it? i didn't realize there were so many uh bulrushes in here. yeah (there are) exactly. don't drink the water.  (xx) are they? it is yeah. yep, it's all over. yeah i hadn't noticed them earlier they when we came earlier there weren't any you see? (sure...) yeah, i hadn't seen_ noticed these before, that's huge field. we also find large numbers of centrarchid nests in uh inside (Hook) Point. mhm yep. that's a good place there're a few, snails that occur there that it it's hard to collect in other places. mhm some of them aren't centrarchid nests but they're, upwellings. i discovered and the upwellings are very soft and you can just drop, straight into one, both feet and you're helpless... notice you see all the nests through here...? i think we're through the breeding for centrarchids. yeah but how are they_ how many have they got? they're getting a lotta perch. oh great. has Janine pulled the net? (i believe so.) good. make these people work. keep the leadline down. let's hear it in chorus. ah, how nice. (oh all kinds of things to reach.) show Matt the correct way to hold the pole. come on alright now put it all the way up on (xx) nice to teach, isn't it? did you explain to Brett, why you should hold the seine that way? now don't let the Jason i didn't explain to him at all did anyone explain to J- to Brett how you sho- why you should hold the seine in a particular way? there's a lot of stuff here. yeah yay well done look at all those fishes (xx) yes (xx) touching them they don't bite do they? no they don't bite and you can take one home and have it bronzed in memoriam. i just saw this pike (scoot to here) (xx) oh, uh well, look at the look at the forage base that's here. oh yeah. probably just having a blast out here. mm. alright. tell me what you got. it takes a little getting used to. (hell of a long pole) and what do you think they are? (Commons maybe?) (Julie) you're stepping on the (thing.) you're stepping on it. some are Commons. there are certainly some Commons in there, terminal mouth high scales yeah yeah those are Commons yeah textbook textbook Commons. and um, binomial name? Luxilus cornutus. Luxilus cornutus. i know that. why you asking me? family? um, Cyprinidae yeah, Cyprinidae. (proper) Greek (xx) E, A A-E, family names, in systematics are always A-E. in,  Perciformes, is that the order? Cypriniformes? we never learned the orders. well you know it's not Perciformes because that's the, the order which contains the family Percidae and is the, root group for the Acanthopterygians, spiny-rayed fishes, so the soft-rayed fishes... so they're (Acaniformes) i remember that being something uh they're Malacopterygians. if you're using the cladistic structure, oh what a disgusting pile of yeah i i, i avoided that. mm. um... that is disgusting yeah (xx) wearing waders they just went woo, (xx) can get away with it this is really gross they've walked their dogs here. i'm sure it contributes to the production of the area. well anybody get like a guesstimate? bunch of Commons anything else? no, i'd say like (xx) (xx) just Commons? (seems that way) how many have we got like fifty? yeah yeah okay? ha- are we getting Pumpkinseeds in the (hole?) getting a lot of bass (xx) we're not getting many Pumpkinseeds um, or Rock Bass as it's happened so so what happens to the fish when it gets shallower?  they'll move further offshore they'll stay in shallow water the depth is going to be the key factor. so they will, just move a larger distance away from shore but still in the shallow water. i've heard, i've heard, that there's an association with size and depth (somewhere) yes, it is rumored.  well the shallow water is a protection just by virtue of its depth and, deeper predators can't move effectively in shallow water. it's also where the wave action is continually bringing up, more food because they're detritus feeders or they're eating the interstitial fauna, which is churned up. this is why if you go on the beach in Douglas Lake and wriggle your toes, the minnows will start feeding around your toes. so this area is also the (living) (xx) so it (xx) food material for them. so how much  (do you want us, do you think we should) do more seining? no i don't think you need to do more seining. if you have any, centrarchids if you could  (xx) alright is it common to get spots on tails (xx) spots are quite common on the tails of minnows. the Spottail has a very very clear spot... what's the name of the Spottail again? (so it would be,) hudsonius (notropis? mhm) (xx) (this one?)   yeah you see? (xx) and it's got a little bit of a subterminal mouth, so you need to check through these they're not all Commons. okay? (you got a Spottail in here?) that's a beautiful Spottail. okay so, you do need to sort these quickly but carefully to get a count on which minnows you've got see this one with the terminal mouth and the high scales? that's a Common. okay? so go through, uh there are Spottails amongst here so do go through the fish, and count the, numbers of each species. (xx) (from a) Spottail? okay the Spottail, uh i- i- is not exactly got much in the way of distinguishing characteristics, other than the very clear, definite spot. uhuh uhuh these are a lot darker, than anything that we've seen for a long time. um, whether it's a local, weather, related to the weather or not i don't know. but certainly with it being darker when the when the the you know the cloud_ the the, the weather is da- is is less sunny, they tend to be lighter. uh the Spottail also has a uh a slightly overhanging mouth, uhuh does it have (xx) (i forget) the Bluntnose does yeah. not particularly they're fairly clean scales alright (they have a lot brighter line) right  well, yes that's still a Spottail, these are a lot more pigmented, a lot more pigmented than the ones we've seen early. in fact if you noticed, the people who come up from Ann Arbor are distinguishable from the people in camp because they're a lot paler. what animal is (xx) Spottail oh, hey there's a Bullhead (xx) um those are, i think those are dogs. are they? i think probably the people up here have a dog, and it comes over here and runs. i think it's pretty cruddy. um how many bass have they got over there? they said they didn't know but they were estimating about ten. is it enough to take bass back? oh the, the bass. uh i don't know. they got a lotta perch. we don't have a large size range of perch though so it would be a wa- it would be a waste of material. do we have uh if we include the (Clyver Dam) and various others do we have (xx) try not to bring too much stuff back oh i agree. oh we'll leave the bass then we'll just take th- we'll just take centrarchids (xx) size range of both. did you notice the color? the perch have been really dark  (xx) it's a little dark in back (xx) but out here as well. yeah? yeah. (xx) oh great. (xx) well, neither. could be a Pumpkinseed it's a baby Pumpkinseed. so that needs to go back. do we have a kill jar over here? there's one over there (xx) okay do you wanna wait and see if the others_ are we getting more (Chris?) mhm you've got Johnnys? Spottai l why? oh they're in the bottom. yeah we did. why are they in the bottom? (xx) Michelle why are they in the bottom? no, air bladder, in their body. but why are they bottom fish? they're negatively buoyant they lack a swim bladder oh yeah. actually yeah we always found them in the plastic (traps) yes that's what i understood. (xx) so that's the one that might be, the, (xx) oh that's so dark. (xx) i think it's a Johnny Darter. okay (xx) come here little Bullhead, come here. got a Bullhead too? good grief. (down here)    everything is dark. the Sand Shiners are, really dark. s- you know how silvery they usually are and light? what what was our final count (Luann?) uh i'm waiting for, you got you got a Johnny Darter? i don't, know, they don't have the (xx) yeah but, i kinda am, confused about that and the Iowa Darter. what um, Spottail eighteen? oh i don't think these are Johnnys. no you see, see the dagger under the eye is clear and look at the  mhm so it's a Iowa Darter? it's an Iowa.  some of 'em had the cl- doub- clear Ws. okay then i- if they're cle- they're clear Ws then they're they are, they're Johnnys yes, but these are these are these are c- uh Iowas. okay is that, (kay) it's an Iowa. okay? i think we can make our way back to the boat. the Ws are Johnny Darters. the Ws are Johnnys. they're the ones i want to rename. why? mm Webb Darters. just as i want to rename Cassiopeia remember.  (you're a crazy guy,) but i like you. thank you. (oh we found a Pumpki-) i can't believe (where) that little, tiny Pumpkin (xx) young of the year. so, how many, annual rings do you expect to find in its scales? probably none right? none. (xx) Johnny Darter? this one_ we had a, Iowa Darter (xx) okay if you want to uh, um Carrie, you need to s- flick the net over to make sure the, weeds and so on are emptied first...   two Iowas and wa- two Johnnys. how many Spottails? you know you've all become so professional. one one? the way you seined there wasn't quite the frenetic nature to the seining, that there was on the first day. but did you hear Jason? well  (xx) yeah no it was a Pumpkinseed. you should give yourself a pat on the back because that was very skilled seining... a very quick class. (what did i) (xx) Bullhead,  Johnny Darter Johnny Darter Pumpkinseed Pumpkinseed  i have Common (xx) that's why they're called Common. do you guys want that (xx) from over here? so we're going back to the boat now? yes, this must make for awfully boring recording. I've heard some interesting stuff here the thing is that the, th- that this this class has been characterized by learning very fast, ah  right see what they've got over here. yeah i know i heard all about it. how you doing folks? oh we got lots lotsa (lotsa) lotsa minnows that aren't gonna make it, you know? we'll recycle them. we got some good Pumpkinseeds good.   we and um you brought a baby over didn't you? yeah i put him in, the bucket (xx) oh golly yes. no i put it in the bucket. okay let's try and get these into the jars and those that we're going to take back take back. oh (xx) that one. (xx) ohh, it's quite alright. how many spines has it got? i think it's (just kind of) destroyed. yeah what is it? i don't know. it's a_ yeah it looks like a stonefly to me, but what are stoneflies doing on this mucky bottom? oh they're on the on the (xx) right. okay do you wanna switch (xx) pardon? (xx) we only want to take a range of sizes of Bluegills or not Bluegills Pumpkinseeds (and) Rock Bass. do you wanna_ wow you guys got some big ones do you wanna_ are you_ are we counting the (xx) okay what have you got here? i got yeah okay these are, the Spottails are Common but that_ uh are here but that's a Common. this is a Common right? yeah terminal mouth uh nose yes, yeah, and that's a Spottail. yes please. is anybo- are_ is anybody wanting to count these? yes please, count. okay Spot- Spottail Common one Common and four Spottails Spottail (xx) instead of um (xx) one Pumpkinseed oh God, here's a Spottail though. two more, (Spottails) so (did we check more for) (xx) time than we did last time? yes, way more. (because we're better) that's a this is the Common (xx) yes it it's it's it's in part because you're you're much more experienced and so you're being more professional, but also, there are more fish now. (they grew up?) they didn't just (grow up) but more of them migrated in from various places, the a lot of the fish will overwinter into the deeper areas, and as the water warms up productivity is crea- is, is increased, more have moved inshore, to feed um, two perch, one Rock Bass we don't need to take all the fish back so if you're getting lots of Rock Bass of the same size, um throw some_ a lot of them back we just want a  yes. one Rock Bass, one Pumpkinseed, Spottail, ooh Mud minnow. Common, Spottail, um, one  the formalin though is uh pumped, around the system and pickles them if you like from the inside. so when they're in anesthetic you don't want them to stop ventilating cuz you want the heart to, pump the, fixative round. one perch that one can go straight in. did you (xx) i beg your pardon did you te- i didn't (xx) i didn't (xx) one one Pumpkinseed, whoa let's take that one back. six uh Commons. ooh look at this i know nice bass Spottail, Spottail oh here's a little one too. you wanna grab that one? Smallmouth? Largemouth? two perch one Largemouth that's awesome. i've never seen one that big  four Spottail Common one Rock Bass  four Spottails. do you want that one? whoa. that's a big one do we have one of that size? okay. alright let's take another one of that size though. i think_ i'm sorry, i think we have enough young of the year. alright. so you want that Pumpkin? yes please. one Pumpkinseed. that was a Largemouth. yeah? one large do we want him? no no. Spottail. no more young of the year (xx) well put the young of the year sunfish back in now. Pumpkinseed two Rock Bass Spottail Spottail Spottail two Common... four Spottail one perch, three Spottails, one Rock Bass don't think we have many of the young of the year Rock Bass so do still take a couple of those. sorry Common what is_ is that a Spottail (xx) no it's a Common. Common? characteristics of the Common? terminal mouth three Spottails two Common, is that a Pumpkinseed (there?) yes Pumpkinseed Common, uh  but Jeff has a fear of catfish alright what are these babies of? centrarchid? um, tha- it's definitely a centrarchid from the body shape, and with the bars along the side, it's going to be a a Lepomis, not a Rock Bass, and it's probably a Pumpkinseed  it it's, it could be but we haven't caught any  yes, and the the Bluegills will be more spottle uh mottled. we've got m- w- we've got enough of those so you can start letting them go. Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch. (have you been touching that uh) Largemouth Bass la- yeah. okay Largemouth, two perch Common and Spottail whoa, look at this one. (xx) (major in) fish psychology. what's the name for a Largemouth? Micropterus salmoides is the Largemouth Bass, and what are its characteristics? (xx) uh, dorsal it's got that black streak, dotted yes it tends to have a black line which gets less as the, fish get older and larger, and but as they get older and larger the jaw extends further behind the eye. are you serious? right and the dorsal fin is deeply notched. what family is that? um, Centrarchidae. correct. (xx) have the record. and it's when you pulled him out of the water did you say wow i caught a (xx) i did i, caught the person i was with, Janine. cool Yellow Perch, Spottail  for posterity. yes that's true. to immortalize our (thoughts) these data go into l- l- actually a long term presence and absence database in which we um are hoping that we can use to see if there are any changes over the last century. sort of we're sort of doing research for somebody for free. yep. no you're not doing it for free you've p- paid c- a considerable amount of tuition. right right we're paying them, to do their research. yeah. (who's got the) Rock Bass? i got a Rock Bass and a, Common. no i don't think so. no. it's a it's a Bluegill. did you count this one? is that (xx) or (xx) uh we don't know what it is no. it's a Bluegill. uh sorry a Pumpkinseed. Pumpkinseed. Spottail Pumpkinseed. Pumpkinseed (xx) (and they get both) i know but i always get them mixed up. don't listen to this. (don't get that other Bullhead out.) he's gonna know (xx) Rock Bass um Rock Bass  that first day was a little sticky and hot if i remember it right, wasn't it? oh yes. don't you remember? Steve went swimming, oh i lost my, (xx) that was a good day. one of the more memorable ones that you've had? mhm. i would say that the first day with this class was the most memorable i have ever had. memorable days or memorable first days? i'm sorry? memorable days or memorable first days? memorable days and memorable first days we have not had three bleeders in one day before. and a hospital trip. hospital trip yeah. glasses and someone else lost a watch didn't they i heard later? aw. here's the spot on the tail, and the, the mouth, is um, just underneath. mhm how can you tell? how can t- how can i tell the s- cuz they're coming off. oh. i agree... oh... okay, the Smallmouth, i- this a Smallmouth um, the the dark line which breaks up as it gets old- older, thank you Jason, um, the jaw extends ends further back, but the jaw is a better character in the older fish than the younger fish. in the younger fish this dark line is a better character. um the tail is also orange. in the Smallmouth you tend to get better bars on the tail... it's a lovely little fish. did it_ has it been counted? Smallmouth? (that has a large mouth) yes that's a Largemouth. the Smallmouth has the (band) right? the Small, the Smallmouth tends to have these stripes. but they also become diffuse as it gets older. and as you get older then the better character is the the size of the the jaw, in the older fish it's very clearly the Smallmouth doesn't the, the end of the maxilla doesn't go beyond the eye, and in the Largemouth the dorsal fins are deeply notched, whereas in the Smallmouth the notch between the two parts of the dorsal fin is less deeply notched. so what that w- that wasn't a Smallmouth? no tho- tho- that's a Largemouth Bass. it's gonna fight a lot harder pound for pound (xx) and the Smallmouth will fight a lot faster po- harder pound for pound. i disagree oh no your Largemouth will jump a little  gram for gram  yay come on, come on. a Johnny Darter? Johnny Darters have the a- have the dagger right? no no this_ okay, the dagger is an Iowa, and the the and there's the dagger, and the colors are brighter and the the distribution of the spots on the tail is different, and um, the the Johnnys have dar- have um, Ws okay? nice job folks. oh man my legs (hurt.) a Pumpkinseed woo i didn't give her a choice. said i'm sorry we won't accept the different, the different people. you're fairly dictatorial (xx) you think i'm dictatorial? don't listen to this. i don't think they can hear him anymore i think our battery's probably out by now. you're not dictatorial you just want your own way. he's a despot (face it.)  (xx) is this mine?  dee di dee you know it's a really tough job but, someone has to do it.  uh oh uh oh uh oh   lemme split oh i, i bought something. i ran off and got something.    so is it lunch time? it's lunch time. in the boat? wherever you like. are we going home now? we're going via Big Shoal. here you go. did we get an air temperature and a water temperature? yes we did. (xx) could you uh, recall those for me please? i sure can. it was whatever's that? focaccia yeah but where did you find it? oh i got it, um i brought it with me from home. mm. say twenty-one air? yep. it's um, mm   there's like a ham and a peanut butter and jelly (xx) oh this is my favorite, (especially with) hummus and tomato. exactly. i like (xx) though too turkey there too? mhm she got you didn't she? just  mm. sometimes, to be a little crazy i put a little cheese on it (xx) (necessarily need it.) mm. (that's a nice tomato...) there you go... oh. (Tony) you want half of this? no thanks i've got (xx) i'll have half of yours if you don't want it. you want half of this? no (xx) oh, sorry. now if only i had more collections upstairs i could split these sandwiches and the fishes and feed everybody. you don't want it? uh-oh now the (xx) hm you want a chunk of this? oh i'd love to try  rubbish over onto the other boat cuz the rubbish bag will be, i think on there. how are the batteries doing? doing well oh really? don't need my, Viagra yet then... what? so what is it exactly that you're studying? pardon Sarah?  garbage bag? yep. are you gonna compare the patterns of, other settings? thank you. yeah there're gonna be all sorts, we're just developing a big, corpus of a bunch of different, yeah a bunch of different,  just to study trends and, uh some demographics of the speakers that, compose those trends and, stuff (xx) (xx) get enough to make sure that it's accurate? would you like some? thank you very much, yes. just we're just gonna be, available (xx) research and stuff. would you like some? anyone else want lemonade? (hand 'em down) anyone else like lemonade? i'd like some i would mhm. wow, is that long? how long (xx) Michelle yeah? can i have some water? yeah water next. lemonade? really? no. not a big hassle. now what can you deduce from your database having said lemonade three times in succession? hm, more down there i think. i'll have one then. oh you didn't get one yet. Jason do you have something? yes (thanks) okay then everyone's okay (for now) uh but you need lemonade. yeah. and Sarah needs water, but i'll get that. okay, lemonade for you. okay. (are you having) lemonade? thank you lemonade for me, and, water for Sarah... hm. here you go, thank you  i don't know has it bee- has it been kidnapped? (i think so) has a ransom note appeared? no, hm yes (i feel like,) kinda disappointed that, it's   um, one of 'em um, not yet. what? our slime gods always get kidnapped (xx) yeah you realize from, frolics of a while ago if one of you had volunteered stepped forward to volunteer, sacrificed to the gods we would have had fine weather today. we were gonna prank (the other) class and we just did the fish class (xx) no (xx) i wouldn't prank the fish class. no i wouldn't (xx) (xx) pardon? (xx) yeah... i hate when (xx) (i don't think we should hit behavior) maybe we should get the insect class. there're a lot of people in that class who, (xx) Brent Tony and i (xx) are you in insects? yeah i'm in insects. i'm willing to (turn.) hm... oh... hm... there's thirty of them. we're stronger (xx) yeah i think we're stronger. they were complaining how cold the um, the Maple River? yeah Maple River east branch was. oh that's the warmest one (though) and you told them, you snorkeled in it. i know i was like try laying down in it. babies wimps. oh, Carp Lake River? cold. i'm surprised how cold Carp Lake River was. so was i when i first got in. mm woohoo, you're awesome. yeah i like_ you hear the the snorkeler i was extremely oppre- impressed at Ra- uh April's ability to talk lucidly through a snorkel. yeah i love to snorkel in tha- i- i did a lot of snorkeling there. did you (xx) (with her?) no not yet. easy pickings. uhuh. were you talking about (xx) for the snorkeling? well, (xx) that's a good motivating factor (for the) scuba diving. oh you haven't got your pictures developed yet have you? gosh (i really love) peanut butter you know what's good was, ants on a log did you ever have that? mhm bananas with, peanut butter and raisins on 'em.   yeah. (i used to) take off the, raisins, lick off the peanut butter and throw away the celery my mom would get so mad. i like dates and walnuts as a sandwich. really? mm. i don't like dates.   so now we're getting better and better a banana, peanut butter and chocolate chip sand- (xx) you have ice cream chocolate sauce and, whipped cream, that sounds good. (xx) a lot but i kinda like it. do ducks eat fish? oh come here ducks. i don't know. i think they mostly eat yeah, they ducks eat fish? do they? feed on the bottom? i think they're mostly herbivores. if they_ well, if they can get hold of a fish they're going to eat it, and they could be, consuming, (oh we) didn't have any mortalities over there. no (they need to,) go over there. you know in (Seeny) the protein dose in a piece of fish you know they'll take it. in (Seeny) there's no size limit on pike cuz they uh, they've been hurting uh, the the some of the, bird populations they eat the chi- the goslings and the chicks sounds good to me. yeech really? yeah. so you can take any size pike, outta there.  yeah is it normally forty-eight? what thirty-six pike, twenty-four? there's an  ew really? a bass?   yuck yeah world record bass are like  that's a_ i mean i, i've caught i've caught you know six or seven pound bass you can just about put your fist in y- y- your fist in their mouth and, i imagine a  i doubt it take down your,   no not at all. you're the only ones that caught a Bowfin. i don't even know what a Bowfin looks like. yes do we have a sample, i'd like to see what they look like? yeah those a- they're in the collection. they are? there are some in the collection. oh in the up on the   they have that, one fin dorsal fin, no, rays and then just and they they have a, uh the males have a uh, spot, orange spot or yellow spot on the dorsal_ on the caudal fin. i don't suppose that's preserved in, i don't suppose that's just in life probably right? not in prese-  oh my gosh yeah cool they can be pretty nasty you wanna try to avoid, getting your fingers near its mouth. yeah they have a (gulah plate,) that can shred, well shred other fish. you al- always should keep your f- fingers away from the mouths of large fishes. i usually try to do that. that would suck. that would do_ no it wouldn't- it wouldn't suck it would be a lot worse than that. bite have you ever been bitten? no. no? no whenever there's a large dangerous fish i uh get a student to handle it. (that's what) Megan's for right? a student oh yeah. Megan no a go- a big Bowfin and Megan's too small. she could go. there's pictures of me holding the big Bowfin. yeah. was it your year that had the big Bowfin? no  no Joseph took a big picture um, Joe Bump took a picture of me holding a big Bowfin last summer.   okay let's see if we can get these boats going. trash. now we're going to Big Shoal right? yes the swimming spot. trash. if people wish to swim today,  no. that would be a no. no way Erica you wanna go swimming? are you leaving us? yes i decided to swim home. (who knows?) probably could swim home too. hey we need you don't we we (Annie?) one two three four five (xx) five okay. don't push anybody in the deep water with their waders on. shallow water's fine shallow water i'm fine thank you... i always put on weight in the summer and it's taking longer to put it_ get it off in the fall. really that's funny i move around so much (xx) i've (thought i) put on weight since i've been, eating so much. that trash? that trash? (xx) pull any seines too. Erica will you is this trash? i don't_ yeah, i don't know. hey,  it's garbage okay it it it like there's stuff in it. cantankerous damned thing... let's wait till everybody's on board, before we actually leave... getting cool again. we would wait for you. pardon me? i said we would wait for you. who's driving today? i'll drive again if nobody wants to drive. well i i don't mind, i don't mind. okay... okay nothing yet. remember that clear the crud out of the engine. you can probably hop in Jay. Luann though we'll leave behind. has it started? yeah good. good grief okay. um this has got a, a a when you pull it out from here it's not connected the_ it's disconnected. uhuh  push this forward uhuh. (xx) and then take us down the lake. not this i see. it takes a ha- a a while this the i- it responds very fast and it so it's easy to oversteer. okay (xx) (next summer) um i'm gonna be continuing working on um we wanna get the (xx) wrapped up. um go a little sideways and zig z- see we're going directly into the wind right now and it's a more comfortable ride, if you hit the waves at an angle like that. and we've got enough speed that we can, easily do that. um, and then um i've been actually getting um information on the warm water streams on the distribution of fishes (for some time,) and um, i need to wrap that up. (xx) i have to do some, (diurnal) observations. (xx) oh yeah. (xx) yeah. (xx) well we're gonna zig zag (her) down the bay you see. um swing through ninety degrees and sort of zig zag the other way... (you notice) something when we go directly into the waves? uhuh and if you hit them at an angle, the ride gets easier. it's also safer. so what you tend to do when you're going directly into the wind or downwind is to zig zag... (xx) yeah, it was. no we we um, we we needed to go a little fa- we needed to go a little faster cuz      okay. alright. thank you. you're welcome. did you get  uh Jason, yeah watch the end of ('em.) (xx) can i_ can i have one of those   one of what? picture of us (electroshocking)   the three stooges. i actually got a (shot) with everybody because i got doubles  oh cool. i'd hit this piece first you know, nice little embayment. you said one. we're doing more than one seine? no i said you only need to o- have one good one, but it may not be the first one. oh. well let's (xx) alright (xx) look at 'em all. we'll take a subsample. um, i- this looks lower also, i- is that like_  the water level, ha- is a lot lower, this year, at this time of year. this is very, demanding it is oh my (word look this is) so tiny yes i am_ that's interesting actually it might be a second spawning. which would be interesting. oh they're so minuscule  (xx) mhm. wow, they look like ghosts, you can hardly see them, you see their shadows more than anything. right. (xx) Sands or Spottails, Commons (always.) i want Spottails though. (xx) yeah. die fish die. oh no i don't want to lose ('em) i don't think so. ohh no fish you d- do you know how many fish there were along that edge? i'm afraid it's going to need another haul or three. alright i'll do it next  that was (xx) (it was) beautiful. aha what is it? let's go let's go out around (xx) well what is it? Spottail? or a Common looks like a_ i think it's, a Common, but it's got this spot tail. subterminal_ well think of the mouth as well, okay but whoa nice. and deciduous scales. i have it written down if (xx) no uh we we uh- we want, i would like  it really was. humble (xx) what do you mean by deciduous scales like just (xx) falling off falling off. the deciduous trees, the leaves fall off. you're cold are you now? (looks like) there's an extra windbreak. call number one. was it colder than you expected? a little bit. hm (xx) all out so that was what (xx) about fifteen fish, (xx) one (fifteenth a fish.) so when you've done the analysis, we were realizing and you've got all these data, and you know about the speech patterns and those kinds of things, do you do anything else with the information? (xx) used for, for teaching. for teaching. (xx) (xx) probably. it goes into the development of pedagogical materials, mostly. okay  to to help people, um who are non-English speakers to, speak_ yes, i see. and in addition to that we also have a program for international students who want to become G-S-Is yes, yeah that makes sense i didn't know, what you were going to do it for. so what are what are we attributing, the water level drop to? um, long periods of high temperature low humidity low humidity? it's been low humidity a lot of the time, really? last time we were here (xx) oh, but it di- i- i- the drop in level is still way lower, so you think the lack of snow didn't recharge the wetlands? yep yeah i think you're right there. i had forgotten about that. not going swimming Carrie? no i wish (i'd brought my suit.) talk to Janine before you do. (xx) they're on to- are they on top? no. kay lift the lift the back of the net up... here put the edges in, i mean heck i've never seen anyone catch, fish before, on top of a bag. look at this yeah look. oh wow. there's some inside too (xx) oh good you've got oh got some little tiny ones, lovely. this is what i call a good haul we will need to take these back with us. okay. oh very nice beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful. what is it Megan? what species? is it Spots? yeah good. (xx) yes. got a couple whoa oh wow oh we don't need to take all of these. big one. (xx) could you take a (xx) i want little ones as well. (xx) yes... (xx) there's a whole, mess of 'em in there. i think we've got plenty let's just put_ do you do you have any (xx) yeah we do have some. do you have a um get some more of these (xx) just put them to the side okay? here's a big one, do you want this one? oh my gosh. they all l- are they all Spottails? (cuz) most of 'em look like Spottails. can you try and get the s- little ones, in each um, can you get those? whoops cuz the little ones are (sticking you see?) somebody hand me_ is there another bucket? i wanna get some more water in here. (xx) there's a little one. oh my goodness (he's little.) can we take uh little ones in? yeah that's plenty. let's toss these out, and just get a couple of these little tiny ones. okay. you have_ you guys wanna guess how many we have? um, it looks to me like, two hundred? oh i think it's probably two hundred and fourteen wouldn't you say? two hundred and fourteen is that what you said? i'm like wow, you got a good eye. okay um we will take those back then the simplest thing to do would be to run those through the um, the one of the D nets and put them straight into, formalin. (xx) i i've just uh_ uh who_ how many are there? who got closest to guessing the M-and-Ms? Sarah Sarah Sarah how many were there? um, i i would say about two hundred and fifty. then two hundred and fifty it will be. were they all Spottails? (were some) Commons? Megan? i only saw Spottails but i didn't pick up that many. i mean i picked up a handful but i didn't look at 'em all. so what's the answer? um yeah all Spottails. no that's not what Megan said. two fifty, Spottails plus minnows. (xx) she s- what what it means is we'll assume you've got a cro- a sample, and we will, have a look when we get back to the lab, and determine if they are all Spottails or not. okay? i was (xx) good job. this is weird cuz it's (xx) out this was all the way open before. yeah it's incredible... (xx) yeah i've n- i've never seen it this shallow... how would you (xx) is there a  how would you (xx) when we uh, we we seined up here earlier, and at that time, the water was washing about oh six inches nine inches deep, across this sandbar,  into the pond. well it was_ it used to be a pond, then it wasn't now it is again. so the lake is a, couple of feet down, two or three feet down, two fee- feet i think probably from where it was, but that's, quite a lot, compared to previous that's an awful lot of cha- change. and this is the first time this lake has been is- this pond has been isolated now for two years... it's a lovely pond. (xx) keep going down. has it uh, hm yeah it's just getting soft. (xx) over there (xx) that an invitation? no. (obviously a warning.) (i had to) get pulled back out (cuz i was curious...) (xx) i imagine they've gone. i suspect we've ruined their reproduction this year. (xx) they probably after spawning, the female (xx) desert and then the male will desert a- when the school breaks up... did someone look after the fish? yes Sarah is that's good... okay. i think_ yeah b- i'm_ this is, incredible...  um a combination. warm temperatures low humidity, um, little rain, little snow i'd forgotten about the snow. Luann reminded us that the snow was pretty poor this year, so, (xx) right and normally it would be stored in the wetlands around and gradually released well, it's not been there this year. what are these (xx) they're probably the same things they_ we think they're probably Spottails. Spottail is a minnow is a schooling minnow, which is very very common on open beaches such as these. (xx) yes. Spottails do. (xx) oh i have a (xx) oh make sure to wash your hands off  yeah, unfortunately i don't have any sweatshirts that was a big boy in the bottom there. does anybody have a spare sweatshirt? yes i have a (thing) in my backpack on the boat. okay i think uh, Janine, we've got a spare sweatshirt so hang in there. there's a red backpack a dark red one and there's a, waffle shirt inside (that you can wear...) red backpack.  should have. how we doing Matt? oh everything's great, working well. must be awfully dull. (xx) ah... the thing_ the l- idler is up what? the idle is up a little... it's a good hat that. wire the shackle pin? wire the shackle pin. okay that would be really bad if we were in the middle of the lake. yeah, uh can i drive the boat? yes okay. i've never (driven before) well. guess we'd better make him drive hadn't we? whose is this? uh, i don't you get wet up there? yeah you get soaked. you gotta sit up here and hold the bow down. yeah sit up (xx) with Branton come and drive Jason. don't what? i said come and drive  yes... all aboard who's going aboard you gotta go real fast right? yeah, full throttle okay buddy? i don't go anything less ever. although you've driven a boat so many times. never driven a boat before. that's what i_ you said i nothing less (xx) i just meant in general. i stay in a full throttle. are we going in reverse? we're not going anywhere. completely in neutral. (xx) yes we are but i want them to clear first. okay you pull this towards you, and it'll go in reverse. 	1
LES315SU129.json	okay. i'm gonna hand out something else for you. okay. i, you know i have another, of, of your paper i have (xx) your other thing. oh really. African migration you're like (xx) (African) migration. what are you talking about? migration   that's what i     and it was like it was like, it was like, the African migration has not   that's that's that's like contrasting apples and oranges (you know what i'm) (xx) right. i was like, i don't know the hostage situation  like he put like a happy little because if you i'm picking up the, i'm picking the r- i'll take the book reviews now while you're giving them to me so, they don't get confused (so) i have, they have their own folder here, they'll be very safe, and, and i expect to give them back, next Tuesday. professor Carter oh wow. is it alright if i email you my, paper? yeah. (can) you do it today? so i can sure. thank you. and then um, i hope you'll stay here today, and could you move i put, two or three of them right here  okay i have a um question to ask you i have my rough draft with me so i want you to like read the paper, but i left my disk at home. uhuh  yeah. okay okay.  okay. okay i i don't know whether, you wanna start but we're, we, we have some business to take care of which is part of the class too so are you, are you recording? okay um, now i promise to, give out the uh, the the uh, take home essay, final, assignment, today. so i have it here, and um, i just wanna know what what usually happens. if i give you this, do you all then disappear and i see you again? yeah  we'll be here we'll be,  we're like the  we're good students you're the core group there're another fifty people who never come, do we get extra credit for coming?  yeah. well i think that it'll it it'll show up in the, it's already shown up, in some of the stuff you've written and it'll show up, some more. um... so, let's go through it again um, it's due in my mailbox at four P-M on December eighteenth, um, and then my mailbox is in University Towers. okay is everyone okay with that? we'll go through one, piece at a time okay. um can we drop it off at the, (xx) (center? the history department) (xx?) i would not do that. particularly at that time of year. cuz the mail, service is cuz i don't know where University Towers is uh the University Towers is the biggest building on South University, Avenue. i guess i would have to know where South University is then right? it's by  Ulrich's Ulrich's Cafe Ja- Cava Java Jimmy John's do early papers go (xx) (the south end of the quad) Burger King Brown Jug okay okay   do early papers go in there also? right next door to Coney Town   South   okay yeah. South Forest.    alright okay good. um, can you further define the ethics of domination...? for question, A part one. well, um, i think a a, the the point, applies in both. um, is that um... that there there's no doubt that we're talking in both of, these examples and in other ones dealing with Africa about systems of domination in which, there were there are, are rulers and ruled. and, um, you'll remember that i, um, put on the board this, uh a couple times this uh, this continuum of nice and evil uh, you know that, there seem to be forms of domination in Africa that were, um, um organized and cultivated to attract, people voluntarily to join, join a leader, and provide, that leader with more, uh, persons more power more reproductive capacity. and um, that you know that's what i put on the ni- those kinds of, uh practices that, were associated with that, form of, leadership or domination we put on, the ni- you know i drew some out of the discussion we had and, put them on the, over on the nice side of, the continuum. and then there were other forms of of domination, that revolved around um, uh, seem- (seemingly) involuntary, means of control that, could identify through conquest, of other peoples through (subjection) of people to forced labor and slavery, and to other, elements of control i_ you know life and death control over, over, individuals uh, a low regard for, the, the lives of subjects on the part of rulers, and and that, is, um, we put on sort of the evil side of the continuum. now i didn- the that was just ev- nice and evil, continuum, which is put there to hel- you know assist in the discussion um, i'm not, asking you to buy, into that. it just seemed a way, that we could differentiate, one way we could differentiate different practices, of of leadership of different practices of domination. then there's another, aspect of the ethics of domination i think, you should, think about that came out of some of the discussions and i think, is in s- in some of the readings, is that, domination isn't al- only about, the exercise of power over people and the, um, and the uh, way in which leaders, and, and rulers um, choose to exercise thei- their power but it's also, about the way, subjects, understand and participate, in these uh forms of domination so i, i see ethics being sort of like... that really applies to the Zulu cuz i did my paper on Terrific Majesty and i thought it was really ironic that, the Europeans the British who were in Natal were condemning Shaka's um cuz when, Shepstone started his system of native administration they condemned Shaka's way of, um ruling his people but in the end, all they wanted to do was force the African people into, into labor,   right  right and i just think that's really ironic just, it depends on the perspective like, both systems could be  yeah mhm and there's something that i, that's in in my mind that y- you saw it in this book in in in the book but, it is, um, this Zulu, praise expression that's sometimes spelled for, part two B, can it be  for part B can it be opinionated? would you speak a little louder? can part B be opinionated for, two two B? you mean can you express your opinions or? yes. well you i think that you, from our readings and the work you've done already, you, you know, that Djeliba is a griot, an oral, a specialist in oral tradition who has a- two B two B   the one about Thornton oh Thornton  i was just gonna say that this question seems more like it's, um, answers your your sixth see- uh theme of the course which is, Africa determined or  mhm well i think that, it helps you fi- i think you're exactly right it helps find a way, in discussing, the complexities of that, determined or negotiated you know that it's kind of like, this s- space you get into and you can't quite liberate yourself from this space cuz, the issues are d- you know about whether Africans have agency, do things on their own you know if you say they're involuntary then what is it gonna say about, Africans' ability to form and constitute their own societies form states and, yeah participate in the economies and so forth.  uhuh (xx) (do you mean that) to be arrogant? yeah  uhuh, yeah i find the the weak link in the Thornton's (xx) that we all find   mhm and so the question is  i thi- i think that, uh will you remember it if i write the same thing? (xx) they're, they're two different exercises and the the the that, you_ that i, that, they they're independent of each other and you have to make your own judgment and i'm not gonna, i'm gonna not gonna, put them_ one down, compare it to the old, the other one, in detail. you know i'll just have an idea you know i, i write little notes to myself i have this, Residential College, practice of, you know that, you're supposed to write comments not just grades so i have comments on, each paper so i i will know what your paper's, done but i'm not_ if you want to do that,  okay, okay. well i was sorta thinking the same thing when i saw it but, uh i guess, the way that i read it is that um the the assignment about the book review was to review the book, yeah yeah mhm i think so too probably yeah unless the first was stretched, in some way. (xx) uhuh see ya oh um, so you just said that the, that each revolution um... so what they had in common was that they unmade, the governments?  i just wanted to make sure did you say it was wrong, to look at it as being, the- these revolutions the unmaking of traditional authorities, and the establishment of Islamic... the spread of Islam is it wrong to look at it as the elites spreading it to the masses, or is that the way? no it's it's wrong to look at it as the elites, spreading it to the masses that was a, a misspoke, on my part. it's that these we- tended to be mass movements, with new kinds of leadership, that hadn't been seen, in these parts of West Africa before. leaders who were, uh, came out of these brotherhoods, and, were anti... antagonistic (and) wanted to overthrow, the si- the, the more privileged, Islamic scholar scholars and leaders clerics and judges, that operated in each of these towns and (that) they felt, each of these city states that they felt, saw as corrupted. on the same note you may have said this but um, the leaders like Uth- Uthambo is that his name? Uthman dan Fodio, Uthman well, Uthman dan Fodio was local, to this region up here, but he wasn't local to you know were the conquests ended up. but it but it wasn't so i guess my_ it was not it wasn't trans-Saharan? no. okay. no all all of them could could you know like in Buganda, all of them could con- claim to be local... you know because if you were a Fulani you could claim that, you could be anywhere local you had local connections wherever you were. that you could always claim to be local, but you could also be, sort of dispatched as some, kind of foreign element you know these Fula, they just herd c- animals you know they don't know anything about, governing cities. uh they're not from here they're not from this town they come, from somewhere else so i mean there, there there're competing, arguments political arguments about who these, people were and what the values were what the, worth was. 	1
OFC575MU046.json	numerical value or your cutoff value the point that indicates where you should reject and where you should accept H-naught, depending on which side you fall. and then so that would_ like, assuming that these are the right numbers, right.  right.  well it depends on what your H-one and H-naught look like you need to set up your hypotheses so there's really some good, you know there's some good practice to start, identifying and doing with each problem, alright? set up H-naught and H-one, and write that down even if it's in the text already, you know telling you to test these hypotheses write it out so you visually see it each time. so you identify in particular H-one which tells you what direction, cuz that direction will tell you whether you reject if it's small, large or what way you go. okay? do you have a little piece of tape? mhm. thanks... so an- setting up H-naught and H-one. in this example, four-eleven, you're trying to see there is a significant difference in the effectiveness. when you hear the phrase is there a difference or not, you're not looking for A being better than B or B being better than A you're just looking for a difference. so, if the differences are all about zero on average there's really no difference between the two methods. if the difference on average is not zero, then you say there is a significant difference. so i'm looking for a two-sided test. okay?   mm i mean what what you're gonna be doing then is you're gonna seeing the differences were what? five negative-one two, there's some negatives some positives and you're trying to say whether they on average are about zero, or whether on average they are different from zero. mkay and you're gonna ches- tecks, check that with some significance, level mkay? so you wanna set up hypotheses, and H-one is the one that will gear what your region looks like, overall okay? mm um when is it appropriate to use a T-test and when isn't it? well you have a couple different T-tests. all the T-tests so far though are really geared at what type of assumption that your sample sizes are,  mhm you do the Z-test versions where we have them, if your sample sizes are large cuz really what you're doing is falling off that T-table, and going to the Z-percentiles anyway. you're basically doing it as if it's a normal distribution overall. mkay when is a good point to decide whether it's larger or small though? what was the cutoff we mentioned?    yes. i have a question about four-point-nine, just mhm. mhm. mhm mm you   see that's a sum that means y- right. right. but the sum of D-I is thirty i added all those. nope that's not the sum of D-I it's the sum of these differences, squared across each difference you do it for each difference you take two minus three squared,  ten minus three negative-eight minus three and square all those. oh that's so long. yeah it is long but you have a cal_ is this yours? um yeah. you have the ability to do it right in there. i know. okay. okay. okay. mhm okay.   mhm what calculator do you have? T-I eighty-five. mkay eighty-five i'm not as familiar with overall, what i might wanna suggest is maybe at the end of the session i can show you a couple things. okay? mhm? uh as far as four-point-nine, mhm right. you alr- you have a alpha. we do? what's the ninety-eight percent giving you really? oh true we already have yeah. okay. okay yep. um i wanted to ask about what number was that? two-point-five. two-point-five? yeah the answer in the book was not what i got and i wanted to make sure_ i wanted to see  yeah. yeah. mhm. we are looking for a direction here it's going to be a Z-statistic. what did you get for your Z-statistic value? i got negative-two-point-nine-four. uh i have negative-two-point-two-two, but i'm that's what it said  no that may be that's all they typed up then. it's negative-two-point-two-two cuz that's what i got. that's what i got. yep okay, so you might need to check whether you plugged in your sample variances correctly or your sample s- standard deviations? is the um_ i- is it the top what did you get for the numerator? for the numerator i got negative-nineteen. correct. and then for the bottom i got six-point-four-seven. that should be about eight and a half. okay. so check the calculation on the bottom. mhm? i have a question on those like it_ does it matter what order you put when it says like the grou- the different groups like the X,  in general we_ if it has a one and a two label to it we'll call one group one and call that X-bar. okay. so that doesn't matter. it doesn't matter okay.  okay well you're sure about that huh?  okay there really isn't but   well there's a couple ways to go. take the assumptions, and test... true they don't give you an alpha what do you get though let's see what the result is um i didn't i didn't do it cuz i didn't know. okay. negative-two-point-five-seven. mkay negative-two-point-five-seven, is good? how do yo- mhm mhm. could i see the answer for four-point-nine? okay these i have not checked so i'm just looking 'em over oh okay um four-point-nine yeah. yeah for S-D i got two-point-seven-five nope, S-D, i have five-point-eight now again i don't_ haven't checked these myself. i have five-point-eight too. five-point-eight also. okay did you enter 'em in L-one? try entering these numbers into L-one do you know how to do that  okay. do i square each one separately? yep. yep. yep yep. and your degree_ you had ten observations? mhm. yeah. yep yep that is the right approach okay? mhm. so it may be that maybe  okay. um i don't know how to do this like in two-point-one-three i couldn't i can't figure out how to do, this kind of, part B two-point-one-three? yeah. okay that's the one that's a little different, i mentioned in a lecture a little bit. most of the time our hypotheses in this chapter chapter ten are looking for a hypothesized value of being zero, right, mhm yeah. uhuh. what did you get for a confidence interval in part A? um ten-point-two-eight and thirteen-point-six-four. okay. ten to about thirteen and a half right? yeah. um yeah. is ten reasonable? take a look at ten the value ten? yeah. is ten inside that interval? yeah. take a look. no. no. w- well yeah it is ten-point-two-eight. ten'd be oh ten oh no. that's alright  ten is not a reasonable value according to the interval  rejecting. probably rejecting. rejecting. all it requires us to is to adjust our test statistic a little bit. you're gonna calculate, or you already have calculated X-bar and Y-bar, but you wanna now see whether that, difference in the sample means is significantly different from ten, okay? significantly higher than ten so you're gonna subtract off ten instead of subtracting off zero. oh. so to just say that, because ten's not in the ninety-nine percent confidence interval, that's not enough to say that  for the_ for that T-one you would have to have the standard deviation divided by N minus one, with that one? the standard deviations will always have an N minus one in them. when you_ but you are given the standard deviations already computed for you. take a look at page four-twenty mhm. so you just square 'em and add 'em? so yep you wanna do the same thing for how you do a T-test here you have to get your S-P... you have to get your S-P, and then have one over N-one plus one over N-two. so you have to get S-P from your two Ss, for that formula for combining the two. the S-P would be the S-one minus S-two? nope S-P has the formula and, it's a pretty complicated one but it's about, averaging or pooling, we wanna take a look at page... you have to take the square of  oh four fifty yep. that's your formula and you know what i really_ as i mentioned in the lecture, pull out your formula sheet start working with your homework with a formula sheet then you don't have to flip pages you've got it right next to you, and you start really feeling comfortable with the way the formulas are presented there, for your exam for next week. they're all all the formulas are there you're not gonna have to memorize any formulas, all we don't do is we don't put a scenario in there and calculate the T for you and then write out the conclusion and everything. so that's why i want you to understand the process but then have the ability to use the formulas that they've provided. and so this one at the top S_ is your S-P and then you've gotta, multiply that by the square root of one over  that's the small sample T, two-sample T-test the two independent samples the only adjustment we had to do in two-thirteen, is that we had to subtract off the ten instead of really subtracting off just zero. cuz okay i just wanted to ask um i'm_ i still get confused between um, independent (in B) and paired paired? RESTRICTED yeah like for two-nineteen, mhm mhm oh there's a couple give- giveaways that will tell you what to do without even thinking hardly at all, right? basically every study is trying to compare two groups, and yes they're trying to make the groups somewhat comparable with the ex- exception of a difference in, you know s- one aspect and seeing whether that aspect is significant or not. the thing is did they directly match and pair one-to-one one from this group and one from this group and put 'em together or are they really just two separate groups. when your sample sizes which are here ten and twenty. twenty um Peruvian, natives and twe- ten U-S subjects you can't have pairing. there's no way you could have paired twenty over here with ten over here. okay. so there is a ten group of ten and an independent group of twenty, that i'm comparing overall. okay...?  so in that example that would be independent. yep what it_ basically they'd said, twenty workers were included in the experiment of these ten were selected at random and trained with method one. the remaining ten were trained with method two. okay. so that's how you can kind of pick 'em out if they're both laid out like that you can pick it out cuz w- that it'll always specifies that at random if it's not paired. i mean that- RESTRICTED two-point-two-three? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED the assumptions the assumptions are, going to be usually in the summary also. the two basic components of any_ of all tests so far is that you've got random sample or samples. and you've got normal distributions. or you've got, the large sample sizes so you get the normality. but those are all the ideas but you still need to be able to say them correctly. rather_ you can't just say what are the assumptions random sample normal, no that's not enough you have to tell me what's a random sample, what's normally distributed what are you talking about there so you need to be able to say it in a sentence. alright? in terms of the actual, assumptions, section four page four-thirty-one, paired design, there's the assumptions right in that blue box. so maybe when you're practicing for the exam and you get your f- you have your formula sheet to study from maybe you write that out next to that on the formula sheet so every time you go to that to look at and do you remember that assumption with it. but you have small sample inferences about the mean difference assume that the differences are a random sample from a normal distribution. that's what you have as an underlying assumption for the paired T-test for the confidence interval. every confidence interval along with its test that go hand in hand have the same assumptions underlying them. what's assumption again? assumption is what does the data have to be in order for this inference procedure to work? you know we we talk about this ninety-five percent confident, and we say that means if you were to repeat it over and over ninety-five percent of these intervals are gonna contain the right quantity, well that only works if you really are taking random samples. and you have normality to begin with cuz you're_ what are you doing in your, you're using a T-distribution which comes from the fact that that's what you should get when you sample from normal curves. T-curves for the test statistic. so those assumptions only can help to some degree. there's a little robustness. RESTRICTED no it is actually normal with some mean difference, and some standard deviation but you don't even have to write that notation you can just say from a normal distribution. RESTRICTED so so the confidence interval again what you said was um, if you're doing it over and over again say it's ninety-five percent ninety-five percent of the time, this will be included in the interval or  okay. mhm mhm mhm mkay. um, i have sort of a general question i- what_ if you have a sma- in the matching in the matched pair comparisons mhm right.  the T-formula right? yeah. you can always do it as a T-test. or no that would be a Z. wouldn't     what if you wanted to find a confidence interval though for something large? well again you would basically can use the Z-alpha over two number in there instead of the T one. so it's all the same formulas. mhm it's the same formulas though just T versus E. mhm. if you always do it as a T-test which is by the way the pair design is presented. it doesn't present a Z version of it really you will always be correct. it's just that when you get to degrees of freedom on your T-table, mhm mhm mhm so it's_ everything's_ it_ this this is not how it was for the,  mhm yeah or you can look it up on the T-table the very last  okay. yeah um on two-dash-two_ two-point-two-three? mhm. i like, set everything up like i set up the uh T? mhm.   you you_ do i need i- is_ okay, yep, mhm. what's your degrees of freedom here going to be? is it five? it's gonna be five degrees? okay which one RESTRICTED    RESTRICTED right you want_ i'm looking at the solution here and the solution here has it doing it with that T-star that we did not cover. why are they doing it with this T-star version? right y- y- y- yeah. wait no.   seven-point-six? two-point-two-three? seven  sixteen-point-four. you got sixt- what did i say? fifty-seven, and sixteen? is what i have written down here now and again i haven't checked these answers, mm. right. will you yep. it's gonna be done just like you have, two-nine- just like you did two-nineteen. or just like you did two-twenty. in terms of what test statistic you should use here... two-nineteen and two-twenty have the, the one that we just wrote out a a minute ago too, so i'm gonna, advocate that you should still take the forty-one and the sixty and subtract it, and the denominator should have the one over six and one over six with the S-P. down there. so you wanna pool the two Ss, and get an S-P, and use that to get your test statistic and your degrees of freedom here would be, ten degrees of freedom. six plus six minus two. then what do you compare that to like what is entered like and then you're gonna go to, ten degrees of freedom for your T-distribution and find its P-value, or find a cutoff value depending on_ it's a lower-tailed test mm. if we did it the other way already on that i mean will you count that as pass? yeah i'm gonna make a note to the G-S-Is alright. what's what's the alpha like what do you take on the alpha? take an alpha of point-O-five if it's not given, and make your decision that way that way i know you can make the decision if alpha were given at any particular level and that would be fine. when is it appropriate to use, S-pooled and when is it not? the only two cases we have here is when you you have large samples you don't have to pool and you do it as a Z-test. if your sample sizes are small, then we're gonna add the assumption of common, population variants and pool. and do it as a T-test. those are the two, main roads that we're try- taking here. so it should_ if it's not a large sample it always needs to be S-pooled. yep mhm. and then if it is a RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED small is RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED yep RESTRICTED for two-point-two-three was the um alternative hypothesis, what was the alternative hypothesis? can you say that again three-point what? the one we just did two-point-two-three two-point-two-three,  it depen- no lower-tailed, oh, okay okay. mhm. right for four-point-thirteen, mhm. mhm i was gonna ask that too. four-thirteen? yeah. okay mhm... there's the little bit about, making your design even a little better by making sure you do some randomization. this is a paired design right? cuz we're pairing up these plots by farm... but even in a paired design there should be some randomization perhaps. if it's possible. especially when you have two items th- that are paired and one of 'em is supposed to get one treatment and the other is supposed to get the other but they're gonna be compared as a pair, which of those two items gets which treatment should be randomized. that's the idea. so that you won't always have_ you know if if your f- farm was always set up to have a top plot and a small_ and a lower plot a north and a south one, don't always give the north plot strain, A and all the south strain B cuz you might have that be confounding. that might be something that says the water all drained from north to south so, the south ones didn't do well because of the drainage problem. and then that would_ you wouldn't know whether or not strain B didn't do well because of drainage or whether they didn't do well because of being strain B. so you randomize. so that's the idea we want you to get in there. how can you randomize? here's farm or farm number one here are the two plots, s- plot one plot two, flip a coin. if it's a heads plot one gets A if it's a tails plot two gets A. and that's how you can make the assignment. can yo- can you tell me the answer for four-point-eleven? okay did you get your standard deviation? what did you get for your  that's much better. and what did you get for your T-statistic? four-point-five-nine. that's a little better too mhm. so i reject. and you reject. okay. uh, what did you get for your T-statistic? four-point-five-nine. four-point-five_ no no no no no. not quite. i had_ my D-bar was one-point-three-three... what's o- what should be on the bottom here? oh square root of N. thanks. yep. um i was confused about how to do four-point-one-four, RESTRICTED right.  mhm. mhm. mhm. RESTRICTED in one-three? RESTRICTED what what's the T-value for two-point-one-five? two-point-one-five...? two-point-one-five was assigned? no. no. what did i do? two-point-one-three? and two-point, one-nine... alright. how did you_ i don't know if you just said this um, for four-point-one-three, mhm. mhm.  mhm mhm    oh. oh i see.  mhm.  mhm.  okay.  okay. so how do you know whether you wanna put greater than or less than zero? depends on how you calculate your differences... in general you're gonna calculate just going down. mhm. right.     for seven-point-two-three, um  for A you would test A as being independent right? and then yeah i couldn't  right, well take a look again. okay. independent. independent mhm i had ten altogether, i just randomly picked five i didn't take the ten drivers and kind of analyze their driving habits and try to put two together as a pair, to say these guys are both are a little a little fast on the throttle or whatever you know they didn't try to match 'em they just picked five, and assigned them to one group. so that's how they're doing it they're doing it as an independent samples design. small sample sizes so we'll have to get S-P, and calculate the test statistic that way, an alternative design for the study would be though, to make the comparison more equivalent by doing some kind of pairing. okay.   um... on two-point-one-nine the T-value would that be twenty-point-one? mhm... two-point-one-nine is um you're not calculating a test statistic here but you're doing a confidence interval. yeah well don't you have to calculate the st- test statistics to get the confidence interval? no not_ but y- the confidence interval can be constructed by taking, this difference plus or minus a couple of these, and you forgot to put your S-P on here, okay? mhm. so look at_ again start getting your formula sheet out so you can i don't know where is that formula sheet when did you give it to us? do you have your packet from your exa- old exams and the confidence intervals? no excuse me the computer modules?  the gold packet. mhm it is back there and it's also on the web if you wanna go on there and  okay it's on the web mhm. um it's under, all the course info and i think it says formula sheets. okay. mhm you  mhm mhm okay. how do you put into the calculator what would be okay how_ i mean for calculators... you have the ability to enter data. does anyone else have a T-I that they maybe want a little more review of at all? do you have a T-I? RESTRICTED you have an eighty-two? yeah. yep have you_ do you know how to put data in, an- in a list? in a list  okay uhuh.  wait listing of i- let's suppose you had, your differences like these... um suppose you wanted to get the average of these five numbers. okay. you're skipping are you skipping  okay. how do you skip do you just push P-M? yeah just down.  okay.  pretty nice right? yeah. when you go back to stat, um, hm hm hm hm hm... there is... there's insert sort there's clear. see the clear  wait can i write mhm basically it's under stat and edit and stat and calc. okay. thanks   mhm. when you guys have it the same eighty-twos, you wanna go under stat, and also do it under edit, so press edit, under stat, and you should have a listings there. L-one  uh like just for the Xs? just for the Xs or if you have two sets put one in one and one in the other and you can analyze both of 'em but one at a time. okay. i already_ okay this is a pair design if it's a pair design you can enter your differences. mhm. wait it's under stat i- i- we- i went to okay. here's stat. mhm then you always have to hit enter enter to just say yes those are the two variable names. oh then what do you do? if you just fill in L-  mhm. mhm. how do i the ef- left and right arrows will get you moving back and forth, and there's one variable statistics, and then you specify at the end of that either L-one or whatever column it's in, it will automatically do it on L-one if you don't tell it, mhm. mhm. how do you make it skip? like i can't make it skip. just go down. it doesn't. oh because you cleared out the one already it it only_ always just needs to be the one there, to hold a place but it doesn't have to be a number. that's part of your data. you wanna always enter Xs. i- if if i'm doing one list i'll always enter the Xs and then just yep mhm. mhm  yep there you go. oh  mhm. now what that says is that you're gonna call up to do s- summary measures, mhm. mhm. oh. okay  wow.  wait i i just_ i lost it again.   okay, if you need to just do quit. and quit out and try it again okay? edit, just go down down, you've got some numbers in there, okay you put three numbers in so far. yeah. mkay, calc. and whenever you get to this screen,  one two mhm... and then you want to specify number one F-one. one variable summary measures... which is calc. oh okay okay okay? thank you. and again we're_ you know we're not_ with homework you have the time to be able to calculate these things. mhm. right. which on- which one is standard deviation? you wanna use S cuz it's  like S-X? yes   so do you know like for your um, large samples, when you use like the Z-test and then you have table three, table, what do you mean like with the, Z chart? yeah. yeah. like this thing. and then for the small ones, you can use the T and then do you use this one. right the T table okay and, okay. and then, and small is supposed to be under thirty. and you just use this. correct good and that's a common, error that's done. in pair design, you always have pairing right? and even though i had eight farms with sixteen plots, eight is still the number i use as my N. as your N? because you're now really not looking at sixteen numbers you're gonna look at eight differences only. so those are the number of observations you have. so like how many pairs     who's your head G-S-I? her name is Kim-Oanh, but you can email me and i'll forward it to her too. oh thank you so much. mhm. um i'm gonna go home and try and get this done  i haven't cuz i was hoping i would just   you have a funny story don't you? oh God share it with them so they know what it is.    th- no i left it at my dad's.   oh    got this stomach infection i had to go to the ho- emergency room, like this was like three weeks ago. i'm still trying to catch up i missed an exam and i had a paper due and i got behind in stats i'm still like behind on my   then i still have to do this make up  college'll do it to you. thank you. i gotta go teach eleven but thank you. thank you. mhm.  oh yes. um i have to_ and then i have to go away this weekend what should i do? i have to leave tomorrow morning so what should i do? i wanna_ i'm going on a plane and i wanna do a bunch of practice for stats  well i would look at the exam two that's in the back okay.  exactly um we are going through tentatively section six of chapter eleven, okay? in terms of homework and so i'll be finishing that, topic on Friday. okay sections okay. is that gonna be on the exam? yep mhm mhm... okay what do i need to sign so i can go teach? to find like the P-value on that, do we just use this? you use your observed value that you got from the test statistic right. the T-table or it depends on which test you did   okay alright. so X-bar is our D-bar? oops sorry. so if X-bar is D-bar if there were differences correct. good. okay S-X equals um, so if i for some reason can't turn it sh- should i still email her or just well i wrote on the top but i would email her and let her know anyway just so it's a- aware hi Kim. this one's eight nine and twelve and i- i actually_ but i'm doing chapters three and eleven this time mhm okay, i i wrote you an email back and when it says homework eight it doesn't mean chapter eight. uh i understand i-  well you can look on my computer cuz basically you just have to get into the server from last, semester and i still don't_ will not guarantee that all the problems are there cuz   mhm. i have to go teach at eleven and i'm  um could i find you sometime later at maybe t- around uh_ between two-thirty and three? i'm here two-thirty to three. okay? alright. okay okay 	1
LES115MU151.json	uh another, handout is a replacement page for the last page of the syllabus, because, um you need this one too? uh because i have no less than three different dates listed for the due date for your u- if you're opting to do the web version of your project um propo- not your proposal but your project presentation. so, between that and a- also leaving out one short reading on the last week that i, forgot to put in, um and then i wanted to give you on the back some suggestions for additional reading may or may not help you in your um, research projects because i ex- expect your research projects to be quite artifact specific you may not, find stuff in necessarily in the readings, on your artifacts but, if you want more information about um, some classic works in historical archaeology or or particularly some recent work um and what the state of the field is. uh there're some good suggestions there for, library reading. uh the third, any questions on the syllabus? so take the syllabus, rip off the last page and replace it with this one. okay? the corrected version. there are three handouts if you need them i have them up here. the, third one you're probably most concerned with at the moment and these are guidelines for your project proposals which are due a week from Wednesday. so they are due May thirtieth. it_ i tried to make it pretty clear what i expect uh basically i expect a one page uh, outline just tell me what topic you settled on what kind of artifact uh what basic questions you're interested in, uh and what methodologies you're gonna use. and based on that i might be able t- to um give you some suggestions for reading or resources. okay? i expect that some of your research questions or methodologies may change as you start to, work on it. that's okay, but i want you at this stage to start thinking about it because the end of the term will c- come before you know it we're almost at the halfway point already. okay? um and i do want you to settle on your, your artifact of choice, that much you should get decided by next week. any questions on this? i don't think i need to read it verbatim. i'm sorry  oh you're famous and you didn't know it (huh.) um, Jamie is here, Krista (i saw you,) you're right there that's why i saw you. um (Hugh,) (Hugh's) not here? Courtney? she had some great comments, she's not here though (huh?) Monica i saw you didn't i? Raoul, there, and Stephanie. Kelly? Kelly is is not here right? Michelle, i saw you. Emily, Sarah, (Shivane,) Keith, (xx,) Jennifer, Carrie, Jeff is Jeff here? and Rachel, Mandy, Mandy? and Tiffany i saw you (xx.) alright. (i need this one.) hey Shannon, um, you said that the trip to Greenfield Village is worth two commentaries right? so does that mean that we're only required to, send in four or do we just have extra (xx) (grade?) no you- you're only required to do four.  are we writing up something or just (kind of) um, i i thought about that uh i think just a quick question about the commentaries um, uhuh  mhm (xx) (well) just like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer  right. greater differences between d- different socioeconomic classes. the poor are poorer the rich are richer, the middle might be more middle. a larger gulf, with more significant differences. okay? any questions on these kind of urbanization trends in this late colonial period? and this was really starting in the seventeen-sixties and continues into the early nineteenth century, uh you know until you really get the identifiable beginnings of the American Industrial Revolution its st- it's kind of the precursor, social eco- and economic conditions that are gonna lead to, an American version of the Industrial Revolution. by the way where does classically what where do historians talk about the Industrial Revolution um, beginning? Detroit   use machines. what?  didn't it start in Europe like in England or something? yeah. it's classically um, most classically identified with uh what would be  hundred   yeah, somewhere a hundred and teens i think. uh so it was one-third approximately one-third maybe even one-fourth the size of Ann Arbor but it was the largest city in British, in the British colonies. um it's kinda_ it's still used for furniture (xx) but it's so, just, used because of the name that you don't really know what it originally looked like. it means_ in all furniture catalogs now like, every designer has something called Chippendale. yeah, i um, i can try to bring in some, uh books with pictures (xx) uh a classic Chippendale mirror might be an oval shaped gilded with uh a lot of, um, a lot of circular facets and then what's classically American Chippendale is you would put an eagle, at the top, an eagle design. and particularly after the revolution right? because the eagle was one of the, um symbolic representations of liberty. so that was one example of in in wh- in which this, originally British popular style got transformed into something American and became, quintessentially American. a lot of people identify this Chippendale furniture as, somehow very very very root American... alright moving on to my uh next example Williamsburg. Williamsburg was kind of a Southern capital city in in many ways uh it was made the capital of Virginia in sixteen ninety-nine. and in another kind of uh, fit of Anglophilia it was, renamed from it used to be called Middleburg it got renamed Williamsburg in the honor of William the Third of England, not that important but just a little trivia there. and it subsequently became a social and cultural c- center and it was especially notable for political debates uh held in the House of Burgesses there, uh preceding the American Revolution. in terms of_ if you think about the American Revolution and the kind of coalescence of political action and political life in America it it had three basic centers Williamsburg Philadelphia and in a more kind of chaotic state in Boston. i say chaotic because, it was more put on the streets, through popular movements in Boston. but in Philadelphia and Williamsburg, it was happening um, in the local colonial, representative, bodies. they were called it was called the House of Burgesses in Virginia. in Philadelphia i'm not sure it might have been called the Colonial Congress. um, and what's interesting about Williamsburg is that wh- who here's been to Williamsburg? know what i'm talking about? wow. you know this is like th- the second most, visited tourist site in all of the United States and only two of you have been there. after what? what's number one? New York no. New York no. L-A Grand Canyon. it's the Grand Canyon Williamsburg, and then uh maybe Disneyland and New York. something like that. and you guys have never heard of Williamsburg? how many people_ i i really want to know this cuz_ how many people have never heard of Williamsburg? oh no one's gonna admit that much okay, you will. alright. what is what is colonial Williamsburg? what is it? like a park   resort? where they have like what's it look like? re-enactments don't they like have re-enactments  (xx) they what? they have like a l- it's like a town set up, mhm right right. it's a reconstructed historic town and it's on, the original site of Williamsburg. and it's kind of frozen in time around the period of the revolution. and architecturally what's interesting about what's going on there is there is kind of um whereas in Philadelphia you see a real, kind of bifurcation in in styles and housing uh particularly the elites are getting these huge mansions in one part of town whereas uh, the laborer and people who work on the sh- um, in the shipyards are living in another part of town in these very dense tenements. in Williamsburg, everyone, has some little Georgian piece of architecture. and if you look at_ if you visit Williamsburg you'll kind of be struck because all of the buildings are reconstructed in Georgian style. i mean down to outhouses being in Georgian style having perfect symmetry. and, they do vary between um brick which will be the most_ like the Governor's Palace is made of brick. which would uh, really is kind of the divider between rich and poor is the difference between b- brick and wood. the vast majority of the structures in Williamsburg though are made out of wood or clapboard but, um even though in England there would be no such thing as a wooden Georgian structure in Williamsburg in order to let everyone kind of participate in this new style, uh there w- is a local style that developed of wooden very simple wooden Georgian architecture. um what year did you say? that is was taken over by Spain. eight- uh seventeen sixty-five. the colony starts_ the French colony really starts around sixteen ninety-nine. there were a lot of French traders moving through the area before then but it kind of officially started in sixteen ninety-nine when the, there really starts to be a a French military presence in the region. the city is established_ and you don't need to know these dates but the city is established around um seventeen eighteen. remains under French control until seventeen sixty-five, then goes to the Spanish and remains under the Spanish for ano- another basically a couple generations until, the Louisiana Purchase of eighteen-oh-five. so basically it's under the Spanish during this time period i'm talking about, late eighteenth century. (xx) slaves revolted and took over. yeah slaves revolted and took over, the entire island. and as a result there was an exodus of French elite, uh free people of color as well as um some slaves. and a large number of them ended up in New Orleans. and the economy of Sain- Saint Domingue uh was fueled by sugar. which was extremely profitable... it was a very valued um precious commodity in Europe. there are very few places that it would grow. it doesn't really grow m- much of anyplace in Europe. a few parts of Spain is about it. so when these people came to Louisiana in the seventeen nineties they had uh the know-how to produce sugar profitably. people had tried in Louisiana before but it really, it didn't take off. and as a result of, particularly the knowledge that uh imported slaves brought because they were really the ones who understood the day to day operations how to grow the cane, uh how it needs to be tended how to process it. it was their kind of technological know-how that created a kind of agricultural revolution in Louisiana that led it to be, um by the antebellum period the, basically the wealthiest slave state in the Union. and ironically it was as it was a direct result of the slave revolt in Haiti (xx.) it's one of those things about history. one of the things in terms of mater- other aspects of material culture in in this period that's really interesting is that_ if you've ever been to the French Quarter, you know what those buildings look like right? they're brick townhouses, balconies what year did it burn down? seventeen eighty-eight. what year was that church built in New Orleans i_ by_ i think it's the French Quarter right? yeah Saint Louis Cathedral? there was a church on that site from the beginning in seventeen eighteen, that structure that you see there is the third structure, um, just built on top of it or something what was the fire from? um, it was it suppose- the rumor is it was a, a candle in a kind of devotional corner of someone's house, that uh fell over_ i'm trying to remember what day it was. it was on a special day in the in the Catholic calendar and, someone just wasn't wasn't  oh (xx) sausage  couldn't it just be because like, the Spanish were the ones that kinda took over. like if it had been the other way around wouldn't it have been called like the Spanish Quarter? like if the French had taken over? yeah i think part of it is that um there there was actually a revolution against the, uh Spanish when they tried to take over it, um it failed and a lot of people lost their heads over it. um, so there was some, animosity between the Spanish administrators and the French populace. but that after a generation or so actually calmed down and the Spanish were integrated into French Creole culture. not only that but just from the dates it was French for hu- almost a hundred years and only Spanish for forty. yeah, although, the city itself i was just talking about New Orleans really only starts in seventeen eighteen so it's about equal. (xx,) cuz it's seventeen eighteen to seventeen  so sixteen ninety-nine was sixteen ninety-nine was when the whole territory of Louisiana starts to be settled. oh  no i don't you guys come across these in the readings it's co- come up a couple of times. um, technomic it_ they're basically what they sound like. what he tried to do is to say that artifacts can, be classified into these three basic types of of functional categories. so technomic artifacts are uh tools that primarily uh function to cope with the physical environment.  i'm sorry could you repeat what you just said? sure. tools that function primarily to cope with the physical environment. candles candles? you wanna_ that that actually was one used in the reading wasn't it? yeah yeah what did they say? who who was it that did that? i can't remember. (xx) (xx) um well it was technomic because you could use it to light your house. mhm candlelit dinner i think  was that it? people gather around it.  um like a church in a church (xx) mhm. like a prayer candle. signify a prayer. so these are useful things to think about but don't ever like with your using these ideas in your uh research projects, don't get in the habit of thinking that your artifact type only only, serves one function. it might actually be a really good challenge to think about, like a hunting rifle, wh- what i- i- its technomic aspect is quite clear but what can you do to identify its um sociotechnic and ideotechnic does it have those functions? what might they be? they may not be as obvious but there might be there. and that might be a good way to spur your analysis. okay other um simple, s- um, vocabulary much of which i expect you know some of this is vocabulary and some of this is so- li- like the toolkits of historical archeologists just to wanna make sure you understand. um stratigraphy i think we've talked about this... anyone wanna just define stratigraphy for me? like the layering of the, it's like the levels of an archeological site like, that which is below is older than that which is above. right. it's the layers in the ground. and, feature (xx) isn't_ i think it's the man-made stuff.  like a trash pile or a trash-like pile. yeah corner of the cave or whatever where  a trash deposit. it can a layer, it can be in a pit it can be in a pile it doesn't really matter. it means, a, archeological feature, that was gradually usually gradually, yeah it's midden it's gradual. a gradual accumulation of trash. as opposed to a trash deposit, which could have_ that's a more generic term it could have been done very quickly as in Deetz's, um, discoveries at Flowerdew of those huge, trash deposits that look like they happened in a weekend. okay but midden is a gradual accumulation. sheet refuse mhm like, people would just kinda like throw their trash out instead of putting it in one specific place so it just kind of covered everything. yeah kind of a, a blanket distribution of accidental trash as opposed to intentional trash deposits which a midden would be. i guarantee you that wherever you live, un- unless your backyard or front yard has been, um, recently graded and filled in, that if you were to do a little archeological dig you would find, a button here a the tab of a c- Coke can there, maybe a few bones. not very dense but kind of scattered around accidentally dropped, you know on your way to taking the trash to the can the bottom fell out and some stuff fell down, things like that. that's sheet refuse. okay it's scattered around the yard. and it has to do with_ usually a yard it can be a living surface as well. it's very thin. but, particularly in cases where you're, where on a site that trash has been r- particularly in the historical area era or an urban context the trash has been moved offsite because it's, smelly, accumulates too much in a dense urban space, sheet refuse might be your only archeological context. uh other than architectural features. okay. um going on to the, kind of toolkits what about mean ceramic dating. we talked about these a little but i just, they're getting used so much in the articles i really want you to have a firm idea of what they're_ they mean. you don't need to know how to do it necessarily, just understand what they're talking about when people say well we've performed this kind of analysis on the ceramics. what does this mean? isn't that when you have um, you count how many pieces of which types of ceramics you have and then you can um, find out the percentages and compare that to (xx) different ceramics. mhm, right.  turn to dust what? they disintegrate  you know how much usually the, different kinds of pottery are worth, so you can tell kind of the economic status that, uh whoever occupied that site. right very similar to ce- to mean ceramic dating the way you apply it you need to apply it to a very discrete context. you take only the ceramics from, one level hopefully no more than about twenty years, about one, h- about a half a generation. and you, total all the sherd counts, put them into the different types creamware pu- pearlware porcelain whatever, and then you look up in these tables that are actually based on uh, on manufacturer's price guides you know, recommended retail what what do you call that? manufacturer's suggested retail  how much did ceramics cost um in comparison to maybe a, week's salary? that's a really good question. i mean you'd have to ask that question really specifically like say for one of those Philadelphia laborers. and you pin it down to an exact year. um, in one of the articles i believe it's the Yench article she talks about how laborers couldn't afford creamware, uh, in the_ when it was really at its peak amongst the elites. but twenty years later because it had become outmoded they could. make sense? mhm (xx) where it's found, like without having it been disturbed like by the people that are excavating it or whatever.  okay. in place it means literally. so if it's_ so if you're studying a house foundation isn't well it's not necessarily rela- it's, an artifact telling you about the date of a context, of a feature of a strata. so, so you use an artifact to tell you one of these two things. so it would be an example of an artifact that can give me a ceramics mhm. and, more specifically or well you could like look at the style of ceramic and then, you would know the date that like the decade or whatever that that was, you know popular or  oh it has to be later than seventeen sixty-two yeah, it has to be later than seventeen sixty-two. it doesn't mean that the structure was built in seventeen sixty-two, it could have been built in nineteen twenty. but we at least know it doesn't go earlier than that. okay, so, type of material that was no longer used or that you couldn't find anymore after that date? yeah, that's a possibility. you might want_ that that is a very good possibility um, say, bricks imported from England and say that you know that bricks were no lon- were never imported, in from England anymore after eighteen seventy. then you could say well, that h- that structure was probably_ now in this case you can't be as sure because, what happened with brick? re-used (it can) get re-used. so that one you you'd need some other thing. a- another a better example might be, see this (xx) here, this is actually, an asphalt, parking lot that when i went into the city records i found that it was, paved over in nineteen twenty. well that's kinda early for an asphalt parking lot let's say nineteen thirty... so i now have this wonderful dating, i'm being ironic here. i know that this structure was built sometime between seventeen sixty-two, and nineteen thirty when it was capped, and covered over by an asphalt parking lot. okay does that make sense? so that's why 	1
STP355MG011.json	okay, now basically this is uh, a study on um, i wanted to look at um, the bilingual population here at the University of Michigan, and i started out thinking i would just look at, whatever people i could find who were bilingual, and then i realized that it would be difficult to kind of, find anything out about it if i was just looking at whatever languages i came up with. so i ended up concentrating on two different languages, and um, i also concentrated on the easiest samples i could find, so i have a Spanish um, English bilingual sample, taken from a class actually of self identifying U-S Latinos. so that's something to consider, and then i have um, a sample from, a Hindi class, uh two Hindi classes actually here, which are mostly bilingual um heritage speakers of Hindi, or another Indian language. um, and, uh basically, no one other language is highly represented besides Hindi but i'll talk about the littl- that a little bit in a minute. um the things that i was really looking for were, uh, had to do with, theoretical affiliation, with um a language community, which might serve as a community using these uh measures, basically, Helen yeah? can you put the window, down? the which? the window, down? the window down? (xx) sorry could you just be clearer on what's correlated with what RESTRICTED okay um, this is the average interest so this is like, um rate, the following um, how important is it for you to maintain or increase language A and you can just put this up, uh, rate that on a scale of one through five basically for the following reasons. (xx) right there, that's the bottom one. (aggregate interest,) and then i just averaged their scores okay, and that's the scale , this is the aggregate score so they get two points for every yes and one point for every maybe, so somebody who has twelve answered yes to everything, okay, somebody who has a three probably only answered yes to one thing maybe, to another representative of that so, and there's, you know there's definitely variability you know there's, people who, it's really important to them to, to maintain language A and yet they have a pretty low theoretical affiliation but there is a correlation of um, uh, this is th- this- these are the questions (xx) um... i was interested in the marrying someone who speaks language A thing for the Hindi speakers and i actually ended up asking, some people in the qualitative interview whether they were interested in arranged marriages, and i only had one person say they were intr- they were considering it still so, but um since that's, a big thing for recent immigrants (of course) especially... um okay... now another thing that, um, i realized when i started looking at this is i asked a question, are you involved in any religious organizations student organizations, classes, whatever in in- th- where people speak language A, and um just correlating with the religion thing, got actually a really pretty high, correlation, so this is just like yes or no d- do you participate in a religious organization (xx) (people) (xx) okay, um, and you see this is the average of the five so this is the, you know how important it is for you maintain the language, and you can see that, um, this is, these are both for the Spanish sample. so for the Spanish sample i mean these are pretty low numbers so it's kind of weird to see it in this form but this just basically means that, we are (xx) (black) (line) (notes) fifty percent, whatever answered higher than that, so you can see that everybody, who's yes involved in their religious organization they did all fives, for all of the treatments, so, um, and, here again you see that, like ha- half of, all this, like two of these students are all, gave almost all yesses basically for all those (added) questions um, this_ it's kind of weird to see this and these low numbers i tried to this like that have you got a misprint there? is one of them empty? no these are all Spanish classes these are, for religion or yes or no. aah  i see okay, we didn't really talk about timing how how much more have you got? how much more have i got? i, that's that's most of it i could say a couple more things but well okay do you want to briefly, a couple of minutes perhaps, okay get my i think we made it twenty minutes a piece, didn't we? yeah, i think and then time for questions, and then there's uh... (i don't) (have this) it's in my bag... um, the one other interesting thing is and i already talked about this in my other presentation but um there was this distribution lemme just find that, thank you RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED i don't know how much um, i think that's a really interesting point i don't know how much um this question's gonna get to that because a lot of that RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED yeah, here i'll put up this one this is actually, i thought this was harder to read so i changed it to being a, a frequency table but, basically you can see here there's, uh,  RESTRICTED okay, this is the one down here... um, for the Spanish sample it's it's still four RESTRICTED yeah well, it might be subject to that because um, one of my best friends is actually taking this class. oh okay yes uhuh mhm mhm right right mhm a new world  mhm  okay mhm  mhm  yeah   and four six but not that much lower. RESTRICTED right i've been trying to find some unmotivated Spanish speakers, but, i have to contact one but but (xx)  if there we refer to her in one of my classes yeah yeah, i should get some more people from my class cuz i have people in my class who, um, i this_ my original sample is actually my class my (xx) kind of test sample for my questionnaire, um, and i got some, unmotivated people but, are these all people who are planning on living and working in the United States for the rest of their existence? all the people? well i asked them that and did anyone mention travel? i didn't ask them about traveling i did ask them in the interviews how often do you go? you know um, the Hindi speakers that i spoke to in interviews i mean it's hard to know with that cuz then i i just picked whoever was willing to do an interview with me, um but they said uh, they, seemed to have gone more often actually than the Spanish speakers which surprised me cuz i thought well Puerto Rico is a lot closer and Mexico is a lot closer why not go there? (xx) the Indian what about maintenance in order to keep relations with family members who live outside the U-S? who live outside the U-S? that was what a lot of people said in the interviews they said either their grandparents or whatever their relatives they wanted to be able to speak with them. but i didn't really, i mean i said you know do you speak, language A with your other rel- relatives but i didn't really handle that. (xx) i think we should begin to wrap up at this point and move on to the next one. otherwise we'll run out of time that's interesting (xx) did you want to, RESTRICTED right um, that was something that um, Holly asked about before here did you ask about it or maybe someone else did but sometimes when i wrote these things i said i don't really know if people think this means you know and that's kinda one of the weird things about doing a questionnaire lke this you know, but it's sort of for the feeling cuz i put no English, uh, i thought maybe that would clarify like that means they do not speak language A at all okay? so that means that it's somebody who's not bilingual, so i sort of hoped that that would clear that up but, (xx) i mean i also don't know what people think about what do i mean by personal you know i mean? the first question is this speaks language A only or speaks also English (like) being bilingual i see i didn't say that, i just thought_ i just imagined people would say does this person speak it at all, and,   if they only speak that one language and you need to communicate with them in that language. right right (xx) so maybe (xx) to ask instead of that that's the second time that you say that's come up. so,  we really need to move on okay that's okay i know you were, my presentation i can, i can give it in a faster or short way depending on the time that is left well i guess we have to, y- i i guess we'll have to make it twenty minutes. uh, doesn't matter to me is that okay? (xx) data (xx) data (up or down?) oh i do i do (have data) well do you want to resolve this by going first? is this_ would that help or what? what's the best way to do this? you can keep the time that you need and then i fill the rest, because i can change the style yeah that's fine, it's just that um, i'm not gonna go the whole time so that's fine.   so you want an interactive, uh response can we manage to open (door) just a little (xx) it's pretty stuffy or will it just be too noisy it's okay. can you open it up a little (xx) just just follow a couple of inches. so i (xx) can get some oxygen. i'm not gonna use the projector. okay sorry it's still (xx) do you need this uh thing? oh no i don't i actually need that yes i mean i would like to (just,) write on the blackboard. right it's so funny i have no problems in front of my students...  (xx) okay well this matters less less is at stake i'm sorry? less is at stake than teaching a class. oh yes. you can sign 'em after (xx) (okay i can sign it after) (i guess) (xx) areas where they're in contact you mean? yes mhm and that would include um i'm (merely.) concentrated on bilingualism and other language contact phenomena. um, how should i start this um Colorado? Colorado? Colorado. yes but mainly uh Arizona and New Mexico. and um... these people have been in contact actually um, with, the Spaniards since the sixteenth century. and that happened because of Hernando DeSoto's um, conquest of Florida um, going you know um, under th- under the um, supervision and tutelage of uh the the Spanish   the whole repertoire what's interesting about it he he he, that's a really good point, he does he does adm- um, he does state that, as there are different types of Englishes you also have different types of Indian English so you have Navajo Indian English you have Hopi Indian English you have Cherokee Indian English. so, one has to also get to know the native language in order to figure what are the similarities and whether they diverge. so i i would say the same thing with Spanish. you have Puerto Rican English and you probably have Colombian English. although, uh depending on the on the contact situation you could have, you could have dialect leveling in that sense too. um, the history about this Indian English is interesting because, by the turn of the century and this was like a, widespread um, um policy for Native Americans, by the turn of the century you have, you had in- um Indian children being forced out of their homes into boarding schools. so you actually have, um kids coming from different s- uh reservations, different places around native America, who actually had a had to deal with each other, and um, and understand each other so English became like a lingua franca. so within that you have that situation going on you also have, in the nineteen fifties the termination policy which actually, um, expelled a lot of the native peoples into the cities and that was another, governmental policy, where you have people also coming from different, um linguistic backgrounds different languages, um, coming together and using English as a lang- lingua franca. but then you have the situation where people become, dominant and people actually, just, using this Indian English. so um there's been some research there's research on that but still it's ongoing mhm do you get cases, where there're Native Americans who speak Spanish but not English? yes you do you actually have the older f- uh the older people, in certain par- in certain parts of the Southwest. there're some older uh generation Navajos that that are actually, bilingual only in Navajo and Spanish. (xx) depending on the closeness of the interaction with other Spanish speakers especially Mexican, speakers, you have the much more Spanish dominant. but within that you know you can still talk about Indian Spanish, just the same way you can talk about, you know, the Spanish that Indian Spanish that's influenced by Quechua or you know, other languages Native American languages. so that's that's interesting i guess it's because we are in an English dominant, society academic world so, i'm sure other p- i'm sure people are studying that too. um... let's see what else i can, tell you guys. there's there's been one, interesting study and it's it's finally, we probably will be very appreciative of it. has to do with um, with uh Susan Phillip's study in nineteen seventy-two, of this um war- Warm Springs um Indian um classroom, where she actually um, studies the interactio- the interactional dynamics of um Indian children. and how they use they use silence, how they use, how they use, uh the notion of uh of group solidarity, to actually both both um, create a solidarity and also separate themselves from others. so you have you that and i believe that she, um used a little bit of the (xx) approach but not, the way that we've been doing it much more (xx) and this is kind of like a a a very um, good field to get into because um, one of the one of the biggest biggest urgencies in terms of this research is educational educational um um, stuff. um we have in terms of Indian English you have, the same old thing about the literature by semil- semiling- lingual speakers, the same things is appro- is is attributed to um Indian English speakers. um, and you also have the whole situation not just linguistic and this is interesting too it's like not just, y- you, the the um, the person, specially the academic child is not just a a linguistic person in terms of um speaking. (actor.) but also you have the, the situation of gestures. how gestures are read. are read by the people, in authority and how gestures can vary, cross-culturally. well this is real ethnography of speaking  exactly and s-  you'll need to wind up very soon, (xx) mkay this will be my this is something that um... is very very interesting. and i hope i can find it. RESTRICTED in some places it is i would say in some urban se- sec- sectors, this happened because some, some urban, community places have a longer history than others. RESTRICTED besides English is (xx) and Spanish in some places but usually s- Spanish comes secondary to English yeah English is totally taking over the linguistic repertoires of (Black) communities RESTRICTED well i don't know i mean tha- that's, RESTRICTED yeah yes it's so little research actually, and i think it's i- it's just because of the complexity of the linguistic and cultural situation, um, one really_ okay this is one thing i would like to end with which i thought was (xx) really interesting there's this article by (Michael Silverstein.) um, and let me, tell you a little bit of this article, if i can find it here. okay this article is in um Journal of Linguistic Anthropology and he has an article Encountering Language and Language (of Encounter,) in North American ethnohistory. and one of the things he does says is that if you're gonna look at a language contact, phenomenon in native North America or the Americas when dealing with n- with uh Indian languages, um one really has to look at the histories because, there's so much history of transplantation of removal. so the people who you at this point think are, the, native speakers of that region might not be at all. and this could just be, fifty years, you know, down the line, doesn't have to be like hundreds of years down the line. and that's one of the things i think when you know that's one thing at times that we might forget to do to actually do our research and not that our research will will necessarily um um, give us a one-to-one correspondence in terms of, how language, is being either bor- borrowed or not borrowed or uh code-switched, but it will definitely make our_ the complexity much more realistic. thank you it's very very interesting thank you for (xx) thanks very much (xx) okay, what i'm... what i'm doing today presenting today, it's n- nothing, more or less than the article that we had from this book that we talked about in class we started to talk about in class, and, we_ i promised to finish. and the title is Code-Switching in Bilingual First Language Acquisition. and i'm going to be following your handout so you_ if you get lost or something just stop me. would you like people to ask questions as you go through it? please do okay mhm, this is an important article so take advantage of her superior, knowledge (xx) in your syntax class  mhm to change the situation, somehow, to indicate change of situation or in, context mhm exactly one was situational switching, and remember the other one? one was a situation and the wu- other was one, was the RESTRICTED the topic situation and the other one was the speaker. mhm you know Gumperz and RESTRICTED okay, well, really this_ about situational switching, language choice is, the ability to select the appropriate language, as base language for the conversation, according to the interlocutor, which is uh (oh) the topic, of the conversation, or the situational context. and from around age of two, the child switches ad- adequately languages according to the interlocutor. most children raised bilingual in a monolingual environment could experience we also had it modeled according to Auer's definition  mhm RESTRICTED  mhm  mhm, which is is basically the same, with a different terminology, yeah this this binary, category. well what is being reported is that from age two onwards children begin to repeat their own utterances, in both languages in order to call for instance the parents' attention, or to ensure that they're being understood. from the age three onwards they start to comment on their own language and to ask for translations, and this is really a sign of separation of languages. and from age four onwards some children are reported to use marked language choice, as a means of amusing the hearer or incl- exclude a third person from the conversation mhm mhm RESTRICTED mhm mhm well yeah, all categories except nouns, adjectives and verbs. which means they're, they're more like function words, tha- words the words that have a function but not really a content (xx) they're not in the dictionary. (xx) differ from content mhm content versus function or lexical words versus functional words f- in the fourth page you have here, uh the distinction, in the f- last column, of the mixing, tables, there's single words mixed German and French and they distinguish between function words and lexical words. and the percentages that we're gonna talk about later. okay, um, was an author called Wieman who talk about, these function words being mixed in early um, stages of of children bilingualism, the problem is this is very, um, problematic, for the terminology and also, because there are many contradictory studies about this, so people keep um, finding, contradictions and, Koeppe and Meisel said this is what has been found so far but they found, they found, pretty much the same tendency, but some studies like for instance Lanza's study Elizabeth Lanza who was, um, published the last review in ninety-seven, she found contradictory findings about this it's not exactly, um, that children start with function words but that's a tendency, so far, it's been observed, and later on, nouns are predominant, it's been found that seventy-five percent, of the switch words are nouns in both, adults and children. now this coincides as well with borrowings most borrowings are also nouns. did we ever discuss why nouns seem so, you know there are id- people have ideas about why nouns, uh are so liable to be shifted about okay? Mary you're nodding do you know why? um, one of the things i read was that there were more nouns,  even     RESTRICTED yeah subcategorization okay but you see nouns don't do this, nouns are relatively easy to move about they just don't drag the syntactic complexity, it's to do with the verb being the head of the sentence effectively really isn't it? mhm (well) and that would be cross languages? apparently yes. uh s- i ha- Twaila Tardiff was giving a paper in Chinese and suggesting it didn't happen with Chinese, but i'd've liked to look at her  mhm maybe something about Chinese also yeah, well, it's just that we we know very well, that people don't like violating syntactic rules of languages whether you mix and it's quite easy, not to do this with ba- with nouns but if you m- move verbs about and some other things like prepositions right mhm, it's true. um, that's, i'm gonna retake up the idea in a minute, um generative grammar tried to explain formal regularities in code-switching by means of universal principles. that's really Chomskyan studies, try to find universal, principles under, linguistics under every language, although there are contradicti- contradictory findings it is agreed that mixing seems not to occur between constituents that are contained, in the INFL phrase. um, i don't know if you know what the INFL phrase is. inflection? um it's for instance um well, in a verb, we have inflections m- the ending of the verbs, in Spanish for instance the verb  RESTRICTED i RESTRICTED this is the whole problem with this, exactly the first the first one's kind of like, the first one's kind of like mock Spanish, to me yeah i don't (xx) yeah   mhm   exactly. i recently gave a presentation like i said about this topic, and it was also (auto) code-switching, and all the authors, they were based on data, and, judgment, and they got always contradictory, findings, from one or the other, and they, they weren't sure they just guessed, distribute this way and, there're too many contradictions i think there's no pro- you see we did discuss this whole sort of whether these constraints were variable or categorical mhm mm yeah right mhm (xx) yeah i think it's true when you mentioned that in that meeting with um with um, the woman who does the language contact stuff? ah Sally Thomason yes yes it was very good that you said that because i think, she also accepted it i mean most people would accept that because that would be common sense to actually say that, instead of saying that it's categorical because then you have  yeah   mm well, w- what we have said about the INFL phrase so inflection is, what i- it's what they call functional head, and specially the f- well this functional category inflection, is what it seems to constrain code-switching. right and l- we said, uh noun phrases nouns they don't present any any constraints they are freely moved. um, research concerned with acquisition of code-switching, and syntactic constraint has to consider, for children the gene- general development of syntax in both languages that's really  (was it) in the homes, which one was spoken in the home i can't remember now mhm Annika which one? German in the home mhm mhm yeah so because of the social interactions travelling to, travelling to, to France and coming back and visiting friends, uh one developed higher, stronger German and the other one was more balanced. and during the recordings the interviewers were supposed to keep the languages separated, it's all this issue with, yes? do they mention anything about the development of their accent, mm at all? mm yeah mhm no they didn't say   mhm it's true i saw that, and it did say that. uh, i can't think of a single one actually what is, is amazing is children have such capacity of reproducing sounds even though they don't know what they're saying, i think (xx) the only thing i was gonna say is all those students that i talked to in interviews i asked them like, they've often said like um, they_ like the Hindi speakers they said like my Hindi is horrible but i can say all the words exactly right right well it seems yeah sorry, go on oh okay i was gonna say that um, i asked when i was taking phonetics i asked Pam Beddor, mhm  just like, you know a bit similar i think to your Hindi speakers, but it's a it's a very very interesting, area i don't think anyone's looked at it. so, more research ideas. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED right yeah predominance they do explain i think what they mean it's okay to use terms like balanced if you say you mean by it RESTRICTED RESTRICTED mhm RESTRICTED okay... we continue, um mhm it's amazing actually mhm it's  mhm mhm also self-initiated switches are really interesting is when the child addresses someone without being asked, and started to appear from age two point, two eight, for Ivar and two, for Annika Annika seems to be pretty, uh advanced for some things but we'll see later, that, there's some contradictions in her as well, and there's an example here, example number two when I- Ivar interacts with both interviewers switching between languages and translating wi- and also few errors occurred. uh s- the German interviewer says    RESTRICTED mkay, right well a lot of people think that code-mixing is a performance phenomenon, mhm um  mhm. yeah that's the most difficult thing mhm  mhm well they did actually stop doing it? pardon? they did eventually stop doing it? um, nn, not really no uhuh,  because the actual, time they do it doesn't matter, it's it's whether there's an actual stage they come to and that's a very important principle of child language i haven't reached that point that it's the sequences that are important not actual, chronological age i haven't reached that part i'm still reading it, but i think she says well, they they still until at this age they mix and, i didn't continue, but, i_ here i would like just to finish to to talk about my own study that i intend to do exactly that, and, will analyze the speech of, English Spanish bilingual speakers and also have a look at these aspects to see if it's really, universal it's cross-linguistic or not, and for me this is what's interesting for that. i i'm g- gonna try to replicate Lanza's um, um study and see... mainly in these two (axes) um, um pragmatic and syntactic um have you have you read Andrew Radford's account of language acquisition, of English because he yes uhuh yeah Radford, was, my very first contact with right okay, right 	1
DIS475MU012.json	okay we've got two options today, um excuse me, Maureen, do you want the door open or closed? oh closed is better. see you later. um, one of them is, we could go over Kant, uh the transcendental argument. the second one is i had originally prepared a review of, the whole semester comparing the epistemology and metaphysics of all the figures. um, my section yesterday opted to talk about Kant and sort of coaxed me into having, a review session next week on, Wednesday at eleven, um, so, i'm gonna be doing the, sort of, review of all the figures at that point if you guys, wanted to come to that you could, um, or we could do it today.  eleven o'clock, and, it's gonna be, twenty-four-oh-two, i mean sorry that's this_    it's April  the twenty-second? alright, um, so how many people would want to talk about, Kant today? alright that's what we'll do. um, so you guys are welcome to come to this to talk about the other part. um, so the main thing that we covered, is the transcendental arguments, in the last two lectures. and we've covered four of them. so the key first thing to do is understand, the style, of a transcendental argument, so or what it is and so this handout explains what it is, for starters. and, you guys might remember from a couple of times ago when we talked about Hume, that we talked about, the design argument, and we said, you could think of it as, an inference to the best explanation, so, Monopoly? yep... these lectures are really hard, i think... okay. um the categories are like, rules what is, what is meant by rules of understanding? ah right. this is a really great question. okay so remember back to last week and the Play-Doh machine? um we never got to that huh?  right well that's actually, what we're getting to today. okay my question is, how do we know that the numina does not already have these, processes already involved like, could it- could have a spatial framework and a temporal framework, but since we're using our sensibilities, a fun factory if you will, we're assuming that that is causing those things to be in there where they could actually be in it already, how do we know that, it's, our contribution yes. this is the question that even, everybody was asking last week, and, um the main way we're supposed to know that is just by being convinced by these arguments, that it's us. okay? that the best explanation is the categories.  wouldn't it be simpler just to say that the numina already has that? i mean wouldn't Occam's Razor say, the simplest explanation is the best one, so you could just say that, the simplest explanation is not that we add something to it  too bad he's dead pardon? too bad he's dead too bad he's dead. (mail bomb)  wha- i  mm anoth- another thing is that you talk about the bent stick we know the stick isn't bent. because when you pull it out,  well anybody  well that's just an example, it's true there are ways that we could figure out that it was straight, um but it's an example of the ways that we do contribute, and all i'm saying is Kant, kind of takes, that sense of we definitely contribute something we all know we contribute something and tries to order exactly what it is that we contribute. um, but i know this isn't a totally sat- satisfactory way to respond. yes? i don't understand what you mean by imposing a temporal framework. alright um... well temporal framework for starters is gonna be seeing things in terms of before and after. or in terms of succession. so, a lot of people want to say that God for instance is not in a- any temporal framework whatsoever and is in some sort of eternal now, right, in which whe- whatever you were you know like let's say you had Cheerios for breakfast and, now you're here, somehow your eating Cheerios and your being here is happening all at the same time, cuz there's no time. i mean there's no way to talk about this easily. but the idea is for us it's really hard to wrap your head around what that could possibly mean, to say every single event happens at once, right, and, Kant is trying to say, that's just, i mean, the difficulty we have with doing that, is just testimony to the fact that we see everything in terms of succession and before and after, at, just the word go, like, we don't know how to think of things any other way. and so, that's, he would say our inner sense at work in ordering our experience. does that help? yeah but it just seems that if we can't think of it in any other way, then, why do we assume, it seems like we're getting back to the same question i mean, how can he even say that we impose it if he himself can't even think of it, in any other way like, we can't understand how it could not be the way we think it is, how could we think, you know, you just, crossed your legs after i started talki- you know what i mean but, i guess i don't understand how we could've imposed that, on, the  mhm but it just seems like he doesn't even take, it seems like actually saying that time and space exists is sort of the most, natural first assumption that you would make, whether it be true or not it just seems that i mean, w- i think as humans we naturally tend to think that if something seems like it's out there our first guess is to say it exists. right do you wanna try to respond Mike and th- and then Mark? i- i'm not really responding but it just, something which strikes me as strange is in Kant's text with the rest of the people, is that there's a lot of skepticism about whether the real world exists, and i w- i was wondering maybe if that's where he gets the idea of, you know, that's why existence of time and space, isn't a real possibility because of all this skepticism. but the thing is if that was true then, he still does believe in the existence of the real world.   or   okay so, i mean it's kind of like, the one argument it seems that he would be able to use to justify, uh crossing out existence of time and space, he still holds on to the fact that there is, a real, dough out there or something with the numina. mhm mhm so y- that part really kinda confuses me. cuz,  mhm. Laura? i was just gonna ask, going back to the whole like why everything's blue we assume though that it's not just us imposing the blue it's that the world is actually blue. mhm right, well so the blue one, i mean, i was thinking about that this morning cuz i thought, (Laura's) gonna ask this question this is a side issue. what are the other ten categories, of understanding? they're in your book are they? yeah we don't need to know them do we? i just  okay is it in the, which, section  oh i remember those now,   yes now i remember that,  yeah  can we go over the uh, the argument for, human sensibility? sure. um, okay so that's the first argument here, um, and actually if you guys have your old handout on Kant one through three, um, get it out, if not it's coming around right now on the left side in this yellow folder... um, okay, cuz cuz basically, (cop-) yeah. did he ever show  yeah so that's why i'm having you look at, Kant one throu- the, the first handout on Kant one through three, and, i mean i think, he tried to do this in a couple of different ways but i always thought this was the clearest one. so um, so what we're doing right now is just in service of showing you, why you're supposed to be convinced that P-one is obvious okay? so, here's why (you) should think there are some synthetic a priori truths. and here's one about geometry. think about, remember th- what synthetic means and what a priori means for starters. somebody remind me what's synthetic. it actually gives you information. okay, good. in a way, synthetic is sort of like, the garbage category, analytic is, (mhm) doesn't he distinguish synthetic, uh knowledge from, th- experience knowledge? or is that the same thing? oh he definitely does distinguish, okay and this is where we get the a priori versus a posteriori. so a posteriori is knowledge from experience. and a priori, is the garbage category. okay so where would synthetic fall, in both categories? these are cross-cutting distinctions, so right, you could, the big point, of a couple times ago is to show that you could get, um...  nope and it's actually critical that it be, a garbage category to Kant. so, hold on a second. (well) Gold did a bad job of explaining that so analytic and synthetic this is a distinction about, what makes the sentence true i'm confused then why does he keep making references to a priori and necessary being the same thing? oh i'm sorry i see what, ah i see what you mean. yes, yes. it turns out tha-  yeah   okay okay? so if it's a priori it is, necessary but that_ it doesn't mean that if it's necessary it's, necessarily right, and in fact what's a little confusing about this, is that i don't think, i don't think every single a priori truth is gonna be necessary. because, here's an example. remember, another way that Descartes, but not Locke, um, but Descartes and other people think that you can come to know something, without experience is, innatism. right? so that you could come to know something by, the fact that you were born, with this thought. so, what's been puzzling me is sort of like, okay so that's another way to come to know something without, without using experience. you just look inside of yourself and introspect an innate belief or concept that you had. um, that would be a much easier way, to get to a synthetic, a priori truth than all the stuff that Kant is doing. if it turned out that there was, a synthetic truth that you innately had. but somehow that never came up in lecture so, Mike? it seemed like something innate would be something synthetic since it's something else that makes it innate, like, that you were given that knowledge, in the beginning try me again. remember this distinction is just based on what makes it true... it could maybe it could turn out, that you had an innate belief, like bachelors are unmarried. in fact, Locke thought, that most people confused, well most people thought that innate beliefs were reason_ they got from reason remember that part? so like when they were reasoning along and they said,  well here's, uh, i mean if it's     okay but i'm looking through my notes, and he did write, he wrote, a priori is not dependent on experience, could be reason alone or innate knowledge, and then he put distinctly Kantian, is that a priori requires necessity and is strictly universal as well. so, unless i wrote the wrong thing down Gold actually said that Kant, had this dist- that a priori didn't usually include innateness, but i- for Kantian's view,  well doesn't he say in uh, or in the beginning that, a priori knowledge, both kind, like, um, analytic comes from the principle of contradiction, but synthetic i- it isn't derived from it but it must not, violate the principle of contradiction? yeah so synthetic, these ones are definitely, the case. all analytic truths are gonna be necessary. and synthetic truths aren't gonna be necessary.     oh wait a minute but nothing can really violate the principle of contradiction. alright uh i i'm probably just like, you know  yeah, no i'm sorry (but) i just  could i uh ask a really general  okay uh, do you think you could, discuss the difference between a human sensibility and a human understanding cuz it seems to me that, they're kind of similar or actually, that human understanding, kind of encompasses_ one of the things that it would encompass, is human sensibility. okay  yeah yeah yeah. um, you're right to think there's a similarity here because both of these things are imposing, frameworks on, the numina. so there's something, something really similar going on. but, the important difference is twofold. one of them is, this one, if you think about it sort of, in a very naive but, sorta accurate, Kantian way, this one processes first, and then this one processes what that one processed, so in a sense what happens is you've got your numina, and it comes down and processed first by your sensibilities. you get output number one. which is, a sense datum that's organized in terms of space and time. then, it's processed next by your human understanding, and you get output number two, okay? which is gonna be, not only processed by space and time, but also processed by the categories of the understanding. alright so, if we could just go back to the Play-Doh for a second.  yeah so that's a nice way to think of it. i mean so basically what happens is you have i don't understand what i just said. wou- would this work  wait how do you_ how can you possibly, think of it   yeah  you wouldn't_ yeah maybe that's a good way to_ but that's like such a     you know that you're hurting yourself but you wouldn't know the fire's hurting you, you know unless you had understanding       okay you wouldn't know that it's a_ here's here's like a really obvious thing you wouldn't know like that it's, a building, right? until, you start organizing, like right now let's just say i'm, i've, processed this numina outside me, um, right out there, and, i've used my human sensibility and what i know is that it's like, at a certain distance from me, and it's right now, at that distance from me. okay? then, i'm gonna use my understanding to start, putting on some more layers of concepts onto it. building is not one of the twelve categories,   mm no even people colors and shapes are gonna be the understanding cuz all your sensibility does is space and time. okay? okay. um, but, you might, right now be sort of showing that there's tons of different levels of interpretation which are gonna happen, and think of the twelve categories, as the most basic of those additional, levels of interpretation beyond space and time. mkay. but that's good, um in my example, you're like, next to the biggest mountain of Play-Doh, you have a knife with a clock on it, and you cut off a chunk of the of the Play-Doh so that's like your sensibilities, and that gives you a shape and a time when you did it, and you stick it in the fun factory and get the shape out which would be your understanding, and then that's what you perceive, what comes out the spaghetti-like Play-Doh. would that work? uh so wait, you're doing the, fun factory twice then? yeah, in a sense  right no.  well i had a problem with that in general, i mean even does the seven plus five    okay. but that was, that was the part i didn't,  i read through it that's why i asked the question okay um, we just need one more second from you guys, hold on a minute so i'll see you next Wednesday at eleven if you wanna come but it's not required, i really enjoyed you. i have a question yes about (xx) tomorrow yeah i just wondered if there's any way that i can (xx) um, (well...) no one's asked yet but um... like it's on, Tuesday,  (hang) on a minute i'll try to talk to (xx) (um, and let me know) what times on Monday, Monday would be better if that's okay with you oh that's fine with me okay. um what times on Monday would work for you, okay  okay and also, do you have my paper? no you know what? (xx) she gave it to me? um no actually i didn't_ when i emailed you i didn't realize that, (xx) on Friday morning, so i had my roommate, bring it to class. and she said_ she di- i_ no, she didn't_ she didn't stay for the class she gave it to someone in class... and, i, assumed that you had (gotten it) i looked through my stack and i was like, (i don't remember Cheryl) giving it to me and i don't remember getting it. so... okay okay okay okay yeah. (xx) i'm sorry no i feel really bad that that, okay tomorrow in class then. yeah okay. bring it to (me.) yes in person. definitely. alright thank you okay. who's next? i didn't go to class yesterday you didn't? no that's too bad. um i was asking for (xx) okay um, it was alright. i just wanna talk about my paper. right okay and i have, this recommendation  (um, forget it, no) it doesn't matter it doesn't? i don't think so  oh okay. but as far as it being this i'm gonna, call just the Law School and (xx) place here and just see what their policy on it if they care if it's general, at the Law School and  okay okay  okay great. i have a quick question (on like the putting) time thing and causation together yeah like if if all times are just at once how can one thing cause another? wouldn't there have to be like a, procession, it's, things have to come_ (if) the thing that causes the other thing has to come before the other...? wouldn't there have to be a procession? if i- we might experience like, the present, mhm well... that's debatable actually. especially given that, causation is one of the categories of understanding, it looks like we contribute causation to the world not,  yeah, (numina) so wouldn't that be that causation's outside our mind? well, or at least that irreversibility is. right   alright yeah okay. thank you v- very much and thanks for the cookies too. you're welcome. oh this have some have some i'm never gonna eat all of this. are you going to have office hours next week before Wednesday? um, not before Wednesday. can i meet you? you can meet me. Monday maybe?  whoa noon is perfect. in eleven-fifty-six? the, G-S-I office? yeah. are are these the ones you're supposed to bake? they do have a little microwave recipe on them. 	1
SEM140JG070.json	somehow Tantra is more practiced than other things,  mhm  mhm four  mhm yeah well i'm_ um a local choice, J- Judy Baker has done a lot of, several books on sort of Tantra in, Japanese w- (xx) stuff. uhuh yeah maybe we should   the local choice would make it five speakers. yeah right five for the price of one. you're thinking of one day? no we were thinking over the course of the semester like five   i mean it would be great if we could have a big conference yeah, well i    pity that Alex is not here. um, i'm just thinking, out loud. and that is the, the move it's a f- it's a very slow move but the moving in the department is to try and get, the barriers that separate different parts of the requirement, down, so that if we could, make a gesture in that direction it would be good. i'm not sure how fast this will move, this (is) gonna well that was a little bit the idea in trying to get speakers from, from all (over) mhm. yeah but i'm thinking of, maybe one or two who are not quite buddhologists but are more, hm right, mhm of course Buddhist Studies is the common link. yes we all know that.  right that's because you know he would yeah right correct yeah well we've certainly talked about that yeah. so, you know us having someone who does Hinduism for example we_ whi- which White does, yeah and if   right mhm well i don't think you have any papers from John, so, you can, you can go ahead without his consent um you can tell this is not the medical school because the form in the medical school says, you will not be injected any chemicals i'm, i mean that th- he talks about the progression, as... at first being warranted to the looking at other stuff. moving stuff beyond the Bible mhm well, that's part of it right? theistic, uh notions. but also, there is_ which i think it's much more important and that is what's the model gonna be, for a normative, uh view, of human societies, right? and that's where it brings in Tom Paine Vico Baker etcetera. um, so, is the, is the Bible enough to provide a model for a modern society? is what these people are asking so i mean they were'nt asking themselves modern, cuz that's the word we invented later, but for the kinds of society they wanna create and, of course they say no. nature or history are the proper texts to be read. but my question is is Cort justified, in saying, that this is simply a shift in the notion of what is scripture? A is there more to it than a shift? and B, did the people who participate in this change, conceive of it as actually, right   right. and what about nature? was nature considered, scripture? mm... i mean, i can't really think of explicit, mhm i think nature has kind of moved in and out of being scriptural, and the ei- eighteenth century Romanticists i'd say, would've treated it as such, but then other groups w- certainly wouldn't wouldn't have. i mean the sc- the_ being able to read th- read God in nature, is an idea that's shared in a lot of different, a lot of different places in a lot of different times. so, i think yes, and wi- if the you know uh nineteenth century Romantics, would see that, but i can at the same time you'd, science and rival religious traditions which were flat out rejected. and i mean the Catholic church i don't think is really really that big on that kind of, um that kind of, idea. so, uh do you think do you think you can generalize that you can, move in and out of that model? i don't think you... i w- say again? do you think you can generalize? i mean you said_ what you just said could be, an observation of what happened (in) particular parts of history or it could be an observation, of a big general notion, that he's trying to present which is, that textuality is, part of, almost every intellectual or cultural process. that's, that's an underlying assumption. right. i guess, i guess i would answer that that what i'm seeing that is that we have two questions here one is the degree of textuality permeating everything, and then the next would be the textuality as scripture,   mhm right  mhm mhm mm of course this is nature in a slightly different sense  but i mean i didn't, i didn't even_ i mean going from that first level to the second level to the third level i would say, no i don't think textuality is an appropriate way to talk about everything, of course that's not a surprise given my job. mhm  um yeah uh  ar- no arche- i'm sorry i was being_ specifically in archeology,  yeah so in archeology there are a couple but they're widely hated. um, alright okay. i think i told you you'd probably be very happy in Mexico. does the metaphor reading imply interpretation?  mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah mhm mhm... right right. now the the other thing is, i think he gives examples, that are... i mean you really can't object to, examples of, figures that, conceive of nature or history as alternative to scriptures, to the extent of calling it, scripture right? nature is, mhm mhm the broadening of what is valuable. of what matters to be  or uh sources of information. right, information and also a source of  what  oh. well, go ahead (xx) so what exactly does it mean to say that um, there's a difference between science is like a religion and science is religion if you're talking about moving our, you know authority and knowledge and all these, even inspiration right? you talk about being inspired by nature and, you know scientists are these inspired creatures walking around campus with these_ so what exactly does that  (xx) um, actually, i didn't but um, i was just wondering when you say that, somehow that, the displacement of these, three different kinds of scriptures from uh, Bible to then ancient history to literature, uh when you say that that's sort of, uh valid that (disappointment) is valid i wonder if, if it, actually is some sort of displacement since they would've always sort of overlapped for a, awhile and then, the, i don't know i don't know if it's exactly um, any, i don't know, order that he says it says it mentions something like meaning the displacement? yeah. it happened in some kind of serial order that, um, he seems to not wanna mention specifically where, how it was displaced. yeah um, yeah i th- i i i see what you're saying but, just to be fair, to him any time you do history that happens right? right mhm, right mhm mhm yeah yeah mhm mhm (xx) i'm sorry i gotta admit i got lost and haven't found you yet. okay page seventy-one, yep line two ah okay. yeah yeah w- i'll i'll put in votes for the first two. oh okay.  no no no uh  ah okay. okay that's, damn. are you familiar with a book called Homo Ludens? very popular way back in the, fifties before even i was in college, but when i went to college people were still talking about it. uh by a Dutch historian Huizinga a very famous, m- medieval historian Huizinga H-U-I, Z, I-N-G-A. and um, it's still a very valuable book it's one of those, books that is, gets shelved in the library and people don't read anymore of it it's a really fascinating book. what the word what the title Homo Ludens means is, the human being as player. in other words, he interprets culture as play. has a lot of examples of, connection between, play and culture. really interesting book. so the lu- root but ludic doesn't just mean playful right? ludic means, sort of carnival-like almost yeah  yeah yeah.  mhm. mhm right. mhm mhm yeah dislocation is a good, good way of putting the consequences of decentering... and what about ludic incoherence? ludic ludic right? and the noun is the head incoherence so if you begin with that right, what does incoherence mean? meaning incoherence. what does that mean? lack of organization or understandability? understandability  ho- holding together. right right holding together. so that things are not necessarily, linked. now what, would this be in opposition with historically? if you, posit it as part of your intellectual program, incoherence what are you trying to, uh move away from or against? the grand narratives of, modernity. right and of course and al- and premodernity also  history becomes a sort of ph- phantasm of these weird things happening, um right now whenever you say that someone i mean um, you know when you're talking to your to your nephew and you say you are being extremely ludic what do you mean when you say that? yeah what do you mean when you say that? yeah Samantha what do you mean? confusing that your poor nephew. i didn't even know the word coming in so um what's the implication? uh well one is that, okay you've displaced these grand narratives but yet you're playing by your own rules or and, in playing by your own rules which is the important word there? rule, your own? no playing. playing playing right.  uh i- it also shows a certain understanding that even your own point of view is unstable. right.     yeah yes and publicly that's what most of these people say even when they are  i've always thought of it as the little asterisk down there and if you go to the bottom of the page, accepting my work. oh i thought you were gonna say go to the bottom of the page it says, laugh now. it's something like an aes- an aesthetic st- an aesthetic stance as much as a philosophical stance right? you could yeah. mhm in the next paragraph mhm, yeah that's the aesthetic part right? yeah um... any attempt to impose a unifying order, on things, is subject to, question. now what does the word eclecticism mean let's start with that. well doesn't it mean an intentional collection of disparate things i mean right, um  right. syncretism syncretism right. right.  no uh y- well but the, historically the word syncretism and eclecticism go back to the uh Middle Age late Middle Ages. mhm  mhm mhm just irreverence toward the system? uh system law right? law, moral value etcetera. okay? so. making a parody. right right right mhm exactly exactly right mhm, (xx) because i know these terms, right mhm. (this is getting ridiculous) or missing, what agency there is right? right. exactly i was about to say that same kind of positing incoherence where there is none. right there is underlying coherence right? makes a lot of money right?   what's that? Sung's actually read this book didn't go past the first page, but oh i see. uh isn't it literally like the different place? um is that translating or am i totally (xx) uh no you've, no (xx) gaps isn't it? yeah it's gaps in the sense of doubts. oh mhm  caprice, um, we had a, long debate remember (uh that's) fou- four weeks ago mhm yeah i'm trying to figure out what the phrase oh yeah yeah this is what our Japanese reading group does. we start from the back and right actually in some ways Japanese is easier right? you have a particular order, that uh you can follow. so this is i mean, i don't understand why this is a_ why Fish's option (is better.) because it presents the same problem, that he critiques Smith for right according to Cort which is that how are values determined mhm right right i think what Cort is saying, uh which doesn't mean i necessarily agree with him but what Cort is saying is that, Fish has localized the construction of value in a way that is more manageable. mhm loca- okay which is exactly the problem, because right exactly exactly... as i see it the real problem is that values like religion (xx) religion falls under that right um, remember when we put Max Schiller on the board and talked ab- i didn't i do- don't think i gave you the last in the list of values which is of course religious values right? mhm  yeah yeah, i think it is mhm. well right, mhm yeah lacks is a noun phrase. yeah yeah i guess it is. at leaves lacks and creates, problems that (xx) it lacks problems. either that or, it it could just be a le- a comma, typo.    yeah, i think he (xx) it doesn't lack problems no that's true. i was just i was trying. to help him out? as opposed to (lots) of problems good editors are hard to come by. mhm now, i mean my translation would be that professional communities are both repositories of knowledge and creators of them, and creators of it. mhm no no what what you say is true but i think he's trying to say more it's just that, it's well and also and then of course then but then the last part is that they resolve the con- the problems of, the dif- difficulty of stasis versus change right. mhm yeah but Fish doesn't yeah Fish doesn't yeah i   mhm yeah th- thi- yeah this is really incredibly awkward isn't it? (hey) how does Fish do that? no no, he makes the claim i don't think he, does that, okay  right    is it, says that their job? i'm reading the sentence as, that's what constitutes them. right yeah. well is it that they, ac- that they think about resolving it or that they actually resolve it? they have resolved it yeah that's where it becomes funny that they're constitutive of their existence the resolution.   right i mean i think it's, it's not clear,   i read it i read it the first time as that they've actually solved it because when i said it was, seemed oh i see no no (xx) yeah they  right. they'd be out of a job if they did. which is why it will never be solved. actually you know John that's very profound. yeah  huh? no no no no. uh our discussion was what what is Cort really saying? okay mkay okay right mkay  yeah the Steven Conner? uh no no. the, uh the (xx) (Shifberg) (xx) Weishegrad alright it reinforces, the bodhisattva theory. mhm uh it's a little bit, funny that i mean when you try to, base your entire system of, of ethics or morality, on the exception. right. mhm. i mean where does that leave the sort of average, or the rest of everyone else who's not the saint  so the big critique i've, seen, is that uh, first of all she, implies that, sort of, the common culture is monolithic. that is it's somehow there's sort of unitary, um right right that's a good point.   mhm right right it's not still doesn't tell you how, the community decides. who's gonna be the saint and who's   mhm exactly mhm mhm i mean in some ways when you say the the the word saint, like like every word right? you're saying several things. and your argument, y- her argument is in part based on the fact, that she doesn't sit down to reflect i mean wha- about how many things the word means. and that allows her to slide back and forth between meanings without realizing, that someone could argue i think, very convincingly, that, the referent of the word sometimes are very different things. you can think of saint as, a story right? a myth. which of course is several stories not one, usually right? uh you can also s- think of a saint as a charismatic figure, which is not necessarily, the f- the person him or herself whatever that means, and then you can uh think of the saint also, as a creator of institutions, many of them were creators of institutions, right? and therefore organizers and so forth, and you can s- uh think of a saint as a moral model, right? so they're all of these which uh don't always correspond, not just in the same person but also do not always correspond in the imagination of the community as they perceive this person... okay it's the lure of exiting the culture right? i'm sorry? the lure of exiting the culture not exciting. i'm sorry exiting yeah yeah well they're the ingredients, of Cort's uh sure right yeah well meaning as a practice which is what i think he means by um, mhm  right reading the Bible and thinking it's real.  is the exiting allowing certainty? i think so. yeah but i d-  yeah can you repeat that? you've got, uhuh okay i (understand...) you know when undergraduates raises his hand and says could you repeat that, it's strmessful i understand.  the fifties that's in the fifties yeah the fifties. sorry. yeah and they and the nuclear family with mom dad, right right but i wonder how at at the end of Cort's day how far he's really looking beyond the Bible like you, said it kind of jokingly right  okay oh i wasn't sure about that. (oh no) i mean the the i i i, i'll say it. it's it's kind of like an obsession right? because uh in the end he hasn't told us well there are other scriptures, there are right mm right. it's sort of like he's, writing a, an interesting description of, this small procession of changes but, all seen through the seminary window,   mhm right yeah i think it, yeah that was my first fear was that we, see we thought that, the skunk actually died in (here) that's what we  is that a fact? uh n- growing up with with many of them on the road,    are you, making a philosophical  or are you saying that they don't smell if they get crushed. they don't smell if they get crushed. then how come um (why) oh that's that's the the the final the final moment   it lasts forever.    so did you get a pest person to go look? um well i'm sure it's not in the, because i i went and, i, just sort went to the furnace and then, checked all the pipes that go out from it and checked where where they went and, there there's no way that he actually could have, gone up just gotten inside but somehow he m- did manage to the, the spray got inside. so it d- it definitely uh you know comes out through all the, heating vents. but it's th- the first night it was really we we we did not sleep the whole night because, it was the, so strong that uh our eyes were completely tearing and our sinuses completely inflamed like it was really wow oh my  yeah, but i don't know what can be done about it it's one of those, you know, difficult things that, no one really has any idea everyone says, oh that's, that's too bad, you know. well they do sell these, things that kind of absorb, odor smells right. yeah that sort  okay. um, can i see you for a minute, after class, sure mhm  sorry say again i wasn't  the theme of Bengal in? in the Caryagiti? oh but even if you say that it still doesn't, follow. right yes  when you talk about him doing this backwards i almost got the, sense that, you know he chose to, publish the the biographies in order to give him the space to talk about, his own,  well no but instead of, sort of beginning with with the, translations and working on the commentary it becomes like his commentary is  there are different extremes. yeah Richard?   i- i- doesn't he use initials? to Robinson? yeah i, it's probably in here somewhere but, anyway. it's the Abhahayadatta. Robinson as in Robinson and Johnson? uhhh, no no no. that's Richard. right yeah it's James Robinson. James?  okay, thanks... does it talk about the stories at all? yeah yeah. that's uh i, we're talking about the st- the story. okay the the the story that,  okay okay first one is still, extant in Sanskrit? nope Tibetan.  i'm gonna read it, this evening. what's that? i'm gonna read it this evening. this evening oh okay it's a little blurb at the end of, a little blurb at the end of okay a book that so it's equivalent of what?   signature or a preface uh   back matter, right? the author blurb? uh not quite back matter. it's more like, what you would get in the title page. yeah title page that's what i (xx)  is a professor of literature and literary studies at Duke University right yeah. yeah they'll say something like he was a monk at such a monastery so you know so you see those things have been around for a long time, this is the way you write it. in uh, i- in countries like France, Italy, Spain, books sometimes still have colophons. and will say this book was printed in such and such a place and the author is such and so at the end. and they also have title of course. okay so, um, the colophon to this one, suggests that it was transmitted orally, so that, uh, Abhahayadatta, did not give them a text for them to translate but actually recited the stories. and if that is the case that makes it, interesting. because what that means is, that there was an oral tradition, recounted in these tales. okay. at this point, uh let me clarify at this point most of the te- most of the texts a vast majority of the texts brought from India were, brought in manuscript form. so the fact that this was brought orally would suggest that it was in fact, orally transmitted at that time. okay. um, the third one, uh and and again just to make sure, uh the point is clear, the third version of the legend, is almost identical with the second one, and, may be in fact, a variant, redaction of the story. and it is from the fourteenth century and it is preserved in Sanskrit, and doesn't have a title it was a fragment, discovered in Bengal, so sort of retelling of the story in your own words? right and of course i- i- it doesn't have to be a, a retelling cuz the two may be at the same level historically, right? uh, so it's really  (finished) um, a- a- a- just some more significant difference right right the implicit uh, assumption which is not necessarily true but the implicit assumption is, that a redaction is a conscious effort to close the book in some ways and say this is it, and that therefore the difference would have to be greater than the kind of differences that you could attribute, to typos nowadays and to, same do- he was um, a important Tibetan scholar that um, is, uh was important in, formulating the collections of uh texts that had um, mhm well in the fourth century, in the fourteenth century he was, trying to present some kind of, coherent right? not ludic incoherence polymath he was right was he another, influential Tibetan scholar? in (Jonah?) uh, and he grew as a great historian among other things, mhm right mhm, uh by the way these two figures, uh it's a footnote it's a big footnote but it's an important footnote. show that the whole issue of history as scripture is much more complex than Cort assumes, mhm  yeah ooh doctor right   right  are they still studied traditionally, the the first two? no... this one of course is  oh  bodhisattva of wisdom? uhuh okay. you don't need to explain bodhisattva right? i think we did that, already. remember that time we did it, okay? someone who often appears, in visions, to people   mhm  so if you see the bodhisattva of wisdom in a dream or in,n or a- or in front of you which is not the same thing by the way there's a big difference i mean traditional is aware of that there's a big difference between a dream and actually seeing it in front of you. if that happens, if that happened to you Marvin what?  yeah will it uh it's great. uh because he's sort of is able to confer, on you uh great wisdom   right yeah yeah you know if he appears in front of you it's almost like, i'm the one right, so it's, it's important. so it confers or confirms wisdom. which wisdom? perfection of wisdom? right perfection of wisdom right? uh  yeah mhm okay  would you like me to say it again? it's in my notes thanks it's better that i embarrass you here then uh you get embarrassed in front of a large group of undergraduates. the middle way between the extremes of, uhuh alright. and and historically? uh historically it's said to be a philosophical view that was developed in reaction to, earlier philosophical views that, held phenomena to actually exist as they appear to exist. okay now we, slow it down a little bit first it's a philosophical view. view in the minds of people. and if Stanley Fish were here what would he say? in the minds of professionals? interpretive communities interpretive communities right, yeah yeah, the there is a, i forgot the Latin, exact Latin but it's attributed to Seneca anyway it says, there is no, single bad book. you know (there's) every book has something to teach you. so we might criticize Fish but please try to learn from Fish right? i mean that's part of the, philosophy of my class so. so, we might criticize the full implications of the notion but it's pretty, darn good notion right? there's an interpretive community, that has to be behind the view. otherwise they're in the view right, and an interpretive community usually has what else? an institution. an institution. right? so what would i- what do we call, interpretive communities that are institutionalized? univer- universities  yeah it's uh it, no that's absolutely, i never thought of it like that but it's yeah yeah yeah it's it's good enough but it's not as great as. right? it's only Majtraya that appears to Yo- Yogachara yes exactly you got it right. now if both appear to you then you're on the right track to eclecticism. right? or the wrong track to syncretism. yeah right yeah. the downward spiral. this must be the ludic incoherence  what do they think. they propound a view which is, said not to propound any view at all. uhuh right. therefore, normally what can you predict about their way of speaking?  they sort of, circumvent the issue altogether or they circumvent, making any claim,    right long  Nagarjima? Nagarjima right exactly. so that, in certain way that confirms his role. Manjusri's role in the legend. okay. so, when he reached the age of maturity when he was to become the king of Suvastra, in a dream, (xx) Manjusri huh it was one of the place where the Buddha made, right right  right  uh... mhm it's the state of mental concentration, right, usually associated with uh, special powers special insights so forth. um, however other versions like Taranatha's, say that the real reason he was called Bhusuku, was because the only thing he ever did was eat, sleep and, go out for a walk. and this is based on a, really, very questionable etymology, because the root to eat is   that etymology you mentioned um, breaking the name into those three parts is from Taranatha's  oh  way back right, i see silverfish yeah that's one of them but in  hm mhm Manjusri Manjusri mm  okay. so here we have what we can, we could call_ i think it's fair to call, a fable. and it's a piece of fantastic literature. i me- i think we, we can do that. if after all much of what happens in it is, incredible. and i suspect that even for people who believe in it it is incredible. in other words, it is something that challenges your credibility even if you in the end believe that it actually happened... and yet it is something that, was not originally presented to us as fiction. it was not meant to be fiction in the sense in which we understand it. today when we talk about fantastic literature we usually think it's fiction right? but the truth of the matter is that much of the religious literature of India is in fact fantastic fabulation but it is not fiction and that's on i think a very important distinction to make. okay. today we know, or we accept in a certain way the fact that, particular religious claims about reality, are not part of the natural order. and what this does it's creates both a distance, and a set of distinctions of disjunctives, that often... cloud our understanding of these texts, and prevent us from understanding the text, as it was probably presented, within the tradition. we re- read with suspicion, looking either for a sociological background, and in doing so it's not that it's not legitimate to do so but in doing so we often forget, to think about what the story does. you know what is the, function of the story. the story is, of course, literature and it's of course fiction in a p- particular manner of speaking, but it is a kind of history. it's a making of history. and we have to understand it what really works as history. it is also a type of commentary and we have to understand in what sense it works as a, commentary. whatever we might want to do with the story in terms of social history, the story is also a marvelous story, that delights us. but in delighting us, it does so i- a- in delighting us it also makes us, want to believe what the story says. and it's reasonable to assume, that in its original context or in the context that tradition has provided for the story, it is reasonable to assume that the pleasure of the text was closely related, to credibility, in other words to conviction. and in that sense we can talk about the story, as, not just story but also argument. and that's part of, the point i want to make as i develop these ideas. it is argument in the sense that it refers to polemical settings, but it is also argument in the sense that it tries to persuade us of something, something about ourselves, and something about the works that it is alluding to.  okay i didn't okay good. um uh mhm mhm, and what did the word   is it physical isn't it basically? i i     right, it marks it as legitimate right? and in a certain way it's a perfect copy right? the perfect copy of, of the King's status essentially. so when you put it, when it appears in wax or whatever, you're using to to put down the seal, it's a perfect copy. so it stands as you all of you have already suggested. as different physical or mental states that correspond exactly, to divine reality. in this case, Buddha reality alright? um, so what that means is any time you talk about (xx)  sorry_ i i have sort of a lunch meeting, okay sure. (well you know) it's not possible but we'll do it. thank you. 	1
LES300SU103.json	duh, well, i ain't so sure what we're gonna do today... to (straighten) up my horror of course is, the idea that i talk like other professors. surely that's not the case, tell me that's not the case. um, we have a little housekeeping business to, attend to today uh, i have the first uh, set of papers to give back to, a handful of you who uh wrote on, uh this topic. i'll do that in just a second. uh but let me make a couple of points to you, uh about these writing assignments. first um i don't want you to rely on me to, give you the assignment if you're absent from class. uh partly that's simply a practical matter and that is i only check my email about every third day because i forget i have it so uh uh y- uh you're much more than likely to, uh get no answer from me out of sheer, inadvertence. but also i don't wanna do that uh e- b- even by choice. so what i suggest is that you, think summer camp, did you all go to summer camp? you get a buddy, uh you know you look out for each other so that if you're drowning you have a buddy that'll say hey he's drowning um, so if you miss class and want to find out if there was a writing assignment then i suggest, you not email me, much less call me, but email your buddy. maybe that uh Nick where did Nick go? Nick? he may uh uh, be softhearted, and answer for you but, i'm not going to. so that's my suggestion to you find somebody in the class who'll, who'll uh, do that for you. now secondly i'm about to take up the writing assignments that you did last time, but let me remind you if you have uh, elevated this writing assignment to be one of your formal ones that you want it graded, again designate that with a big uh, uh W at the top, which stands for, writing or, woe is me or will this never end or whatever some W though so that, Nick will know that's, uh, your paper. um, let me then, hand back these this first set Nick did you wanna say anything about these uh? no they were they were look good so far. um, don't be afraid to use the i, um and ha- students are though aren't they? yeah i don't know i sh- i- i remember being taught that  yeah go ahead and use the first person. and you can assume, that your reader has um, is familiar with the text. i mean again with a with a three-page, response there's no real need to get, to get too um, ah expositional with uh, your explanations about plot or, or you know sort of the action, the narrative action of the story so you can just assume straight off the bat that, um your reader has read, the text and yeah it's uh knows who the characters are,  yeah right uh Gail Chadwick? here Mary Jaralin? uh Lillian Heffner? and Shelly Zimford. do y'all remember that that, did you see the story on the news there was some professor i think over at uh Macomb Community College, uh and he was getting in all sorts of trouble for using such profane language an English professor of course, using such profane language so i'm tempted to do that today just riddle my speech with you know all of this profanity and see if they would, give us an X rating. uh okay, uh i had asked you to uh give me your opinion today on a particular topic, um having to do with Christopher Newman's disposition of the letter that uh, comes into his possession from the, the old Marquis... and i wanna take those up now, uh but i also wanted to uh pose one, fact question, for you to answer my, daily factoid, on the same sheet, it's this. uh when Christopher Newman, uh last sees, Noemie Nioche, in London, uh with whom is she walking? huh mhm i thought the passage where um Mrs Bread is talking about the ribbon that she kept like all her life, i mean i thought there must be something going on there, between the two of them between the two of 'em, i mean even if it wasn't, official,  well i thought that, that there was no choice like, as far as his character goes for him to do anything else but burn the letter. because like, he's so, noble, like he's presented as such a noble figure that like, even as i read the last few chapters i'm like yeah right he's not gonna use the letter  yeah  yeah  and he didn't. he was too, what? he was too noble  yeah uh um, maybe he was sort of you know he was, set up there's a scene in which, he meets the Marquis and her son i, can never remember the title, yeah yeah the yeah the young, the young Marquis? yeah the young Marquis, in which um each recognized, the uh talents of the other or the the ingrained nobleness, of the other. well h- he feels that way more about the mother i think doesn't he? he says to the Ma- the the the the titles here are hard, Marquis is the feminine and i guess Marquises is the plural, (jumping in) um and he says to the Marquis uh i would have been your greatest admirer. uh, he in fact he sees some, kinship i think between himself and her, uh that they are you know in the way they're both sort of daring, bold, uh the son is kind of a, a factotum isn't he? kind of a wimp uh yeah his mother's always saying do something he says what? uh you know and he's not he's not a great, figure in the novel i think, but but, Newman does see a kind of_ you wonder if the Marquis had if the roles were reversed and she had a letter she could use on Newman, not too much question she'd have, stuck it in him and twisted it is there? i mean she i- she's a pretty ruthless figure. i mean anybody who would kill their husband over a, question of who shall our daughter marry, and if they disagree, she poisons him uh i mean you know, and, (uh you know) i think in some way, uh James is meaning for us to see her as this great, the, as the French would say um i guess, i thought that, in a way i kinda hoped that he would, tell everybody about it, just because, they were so mean that, you kinda didn't want them to get away with it. that they deserved it. yeah. yeah. um, any of you feel that way? maybe i should have put it in this way if you'd been in Newman's place what would you have done with the letter? uh i think that, throughout the novel, Newman was so built up, to be this noble and great person just in order to, have a shot, at even at even  that, at the end of the novel he c- he had to burn the letter in order, because that was in his character.  okay. okay that- that- he is so good and you know this is what Mrs Tristram says to him right at the end, the Bellegardes never really feared you very much. and that's the reason why mhm? that's that's what i think is so interesting cuz how i read the end was that, after you know, Mrs Tristram says, you know you're a great person they were never (scared at the beginning,) he kinda he looks back that's right  um i also think that, part of it is at the end of the story he's tired. you know? he's, he's endured so much um, action and so much, like injustice, that at the end he comes he only has his himself and his character to draw upon, his past, um and he realizes i think that, um, to act, to disgrace the Bellegarde's name would also be, um to hurt those that he's come to, to love most.    not so much. i mean the- a- a- are you are you saying that that uh, there's still a certain amount of calculation, in what Newman is doing where he says, well, if i did that i would hurt, s- these people or i would hurt myself in this way, rather than it just being this completely, generous, disinterested, which i hope you know doesn't mean uninterested, action on his part? and i think part of it is, a big part of it is calculated just like in the story, even his affections for Claire part of it was calculated. part of it was genuine i think, you know that he actually  yeah yeah, that's right okay l-  i think there was some nobility in uh when he goes to the older lady, um Madame d' Outreville the duchess well he thinks she's just simply being, um, how shall we say it, uh, super subtle, rather cunning. uh le- let me take this up with you just for a second, uh this is in the stage where he still wants to expose the Bellegardes. he's got that letter in his pocket and he's going around, this is the the beginning he thinks of, showing them up for what they are and the first person that he goes to is is is the old duchess, the supposedly the most uh what? venerated figure in, aristocratic France. and he doesn't do it, he doesn't show her the letter. is it because, h- her, the nobility of her character dissuades him...? his own view of this is wh- what do you recall...? she would have believed it. he had no, he didn't doubt that, that she would've believed him. but uh, she would in a sense have closed ranks, with the Bellegardes. she might even later, who knows this is, pure speculation, she might even later have, in some way criticized them. but not to him, not publicly, not to an outsider you see. so that he saw suddenly that he's dealing with uh, people who even if he divulged this information they might indeed think much less of the Bellegardes, but it would always be, contained, within those, private walls of the, of the Saint-Germaine. does that make sense? and he realized in a way, i don't know that_ i don't know how this affects our idea of his nobleness, but he realizes in a way, what's he gonna do with these letters, if not burn them...? was there no, National Enquirer in Paris then? no Hard Copy? no gossip columnist that you know, couldn't you do something with this letter? it's it's, partly it seems as if Newman doesn't have an avenue for his, if he_ although i don't think, that's what James wanted us to conclude. you see, that he didn't expose them because he simply had no means to do it i don't think James wanted us to view it in those terms, but rather to see it as this act of great, magnanimity. there's another problem with this that i wanted to raise with you although in a way it's an illegitimate, consideration, uh, i've always thought, th- tha- that Newman did the wrong thing by burning the letters, because i thought he owed something to the old Marquis. the old Marquis uh gave the letter to Mrs Bread and said uh, uh on page four-fourteen, uh, i think like not only that but i think Valentin wanted him to expose them too cuz he knew      and maybe she wouldn't. but it was that, was it Newman's judgment to make? in other words isn't he burning evidence of a crime, uh purely for his own, moral self-satisfact- as i say i think this is an illegitimate, consideration i've injected here because James doesn't make that really part of the calculus of the novel. but still when i was reading the novel i thought, hey wait a minute you know, mhm there's that conversation about slinging mud, which i thought was really interesting, and there really is no way i mean it's still true today there's no way to sling mud without getting your hands dirty. and so i mean  mhm.   well all i can say is if i were in Newman's place i'd've gone to the police and said um i just actually had a quick question about that scene with the duchess. um, i'm l- trying to, find the page number so, i'm gonna keep talking as i look for it. but like, it seems like, in that s- in that like that scene, the point of view changes like really quick like to her point of view when she says she's gonna act charming, and then like she won't like speak to him again is that like, is that just our imagination- or is that like       well i i think he's, he's uh that that's uh you're right that is an interesting stylistic device because, it's he's gonna give us the motive and then he kind of indicates, Newman wasn't quite sure why he did it. is that the-  therefore she would be charming, uh but she would never see him again. okay yeah you're you're right for a minute at least we are in the duchess's mind. i'll see him i'll see what he w- i'll see what he wants, i'll be charming to him, uh but he's not... he doesn't matter to me i you know i've always wondered if he pulled out the letter and read it what would have been her reaction? i'm always wanting to rewrite people's books for them, terrible fault, um, uh, but when he tries to broach anything she always has ways of what deflecting it, yes um could the end also be a contrast? because it seems like, throughout the majority of the novel, um Newman's built up, you know like his character's built up and you know, he's so persistent and so strong and so invincible, that, maybe at the end, he's presenting a contrast? like i remember reading on four-thirty-eight um, you know, he's talking about h- he had no desire to make acquaintances and, you know, he thought a great deal of Madame de Cintre, he lived over and over again the happiest hours he had known, um he starts to think yes, yes oh he is,  i see your point yeah. no  well perhaps also um, Newman's aggressiveness always came from his self-interest. he always has something to gain by his, solving problems and in this case, he really has nothing left to gain from the situation, that's right.  i'm just you know i- i'm for the noblemen though.  she does  and they talk about that right at the end where he says to her, why did you ever, start this in the first place? was it just, curiosity on your part? and she says uh what? do you remember this? uh, can we get it's very very near the end uh, it's an interesting passage uh, four-twenty-eight. he says to her it kinda seemed like she did it for like her own like entertainment. yeah. yeah. exactly. i don't think (xx) that's what she means by curiosity i just wanted to see what would happen. i don't think that's a good enough reason. yeah. James, the James's fiction is full of people like this. uh i think the greatest of all James novels although, obviously (xx) is Portrait of a Lady. and in it uh, a young man, Ralph Tuchett, manages for his cousin Isabel Archer to inherit a lot of money, a great deal of money, because he says he wanted to see what would happen, to her, in the world if she had, wings to fly anywhere. this money's gonna free her he thinks. give her all this money, i just wanna see what would happen to her. do you do you remember that old show, the the Millionaire? not Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, it used to be, the guy who would go around and give people a million dollars. someone would show up and knock on your door millionaire and say Jean what Tipton Thomas something Ja- well anyway. uh he and, because he just wanted to see, what would this person do if you said they had a million dollars what would this person do? and of course a lot of times the stories were terrible. tha- you know awful things would happen. but they were just satisfying their curios- so Ralph Tuchett in Portrait of a Lady, just wants to see, what will happen to my cousin, if she's suddenly made extremely wealthy? you see, and, pretty awful things happen to her, uh and to some degree that's what's true of Mrs Tristram here. i just wanna see. you remember when he goes to her and tells her about the party he's planning she says uh it's uh what's her first word? odious. it's delicious. you see? it's a terrible party to give. i love it. you you so you know her kind of character don't you? she just likes to see, in a way she likes to cause trouble or you know just, uh, throw the golden apple in the midst of all the people and see how they're gonna fight over it. so yeah i think that she's a she's a fascinating character as a kind of a obser- and if you wanna make it psychological you could say she's bored, you know her husband's a dimwit, she has nothing else to do, so why not just, arrange people's lives, meddle a little, see if i can't cause some, excitement hm? uh uh James says as i say this often, catalyst sort of character who looks and says let's see what will happen if we do such and such. Jean did you have a? i don't know i i was just trying to i wish i could've found the spot then, i mean i, i sorta wanna discount her now, when she talks about how aristocratic it was for the Bellegardes to, you know g- get rid of him in  mhm but was it you know, there was a comment made that she maybe she did she do this, well he was getting at revenge but, wasn't the final straw where she had to escort him    yeah  mine, yours. okay, very good very good. 	1
STP200JU019.json	alright, who is doing number one? (okay,) go. oh a reminder turn to page one hundred and twelve, your laboratory, discussion group presentation grading form. you will be assigning four points today. Lewis acids and bases... so, please get those ready... the group who's presenting number one will they please come up? and if you haven't already will you please pass in your labs? very short. (xx) quite a number of people (xx) (xx) (xx) (xx) yep... um, we had number one, um the first part of our question, asked us to um, (xx) some (class data,) uh does (xx) acidity vary from family to family, on the periodic table, and so, basically made a, a print test out of we made a, a diagram of like, how um, you gotta show that from family one to heavy metals, the acidity increase, um with heavy metal_ family one being P-H of five-point-four-nine the average P-H. family two being five-point-seven, transition metals being five-point-one nine and, then the most acidic heavy metals being two-point-five-two. so we concluded that basically acidity increase is going to the right on the periodic table, and then um for the second part we were asked, um, N-A-plus or M-G-two-plus, which one would be more acidic and basically why and, looking on the periodic table, M-G-two-plus is more to the right, than N- N-A-plus so um, we said that M-G-two-plus would be more acidic. and then, the third part was asking um, would it be preferable to apply, um L-I and then (go over) to C-A sulfate to the solid ground. until the (solid) ground is acid (living) so, y- sa- um (that the) most acidic would be the best one which would be, and then since it's, also more to your right than (you would choose, aluminum.) (um) uh... uh for the last one um (we spoke) (xx) about the, the formation of, the acid (mutually,) so basically what happened is like, as um (xx) uh as it moved to the right of the periodic table, it become more acidic, uh (and) it, also increases the electronegativity, as you can see from here that, as you move to the, right it will increase, there are some exceptions but, (xx) so uh, the main (xx) is (like) because like the more electronegativity, is (likely) to attract more electrons, so that (the) (proton) will be more positive, with respect to (xx) so, (you) tend to (lose) (xx) you tend to, get (out of the) molecules (and) form with a- with another, (xx) water molecules to form the (hydronium) (xx) (the) ions with the H- H-three-O-plus. (it) basically explain why, (we) increase the activity of the solution. and for the last one, we are asked to, to explain the relationship between the, charge density, with the acidity, so basically uh we defined, um, uh (okay) the density as um positive uh the positive charge divided by the ion radius, which is given here, zero-point-eight-one something like that, so (i-) as you can see that, as we move uh from left to right, the radius decreases. uh, i mean excluding the, (th-) (the ruse) thank you. there is no question two. yes there is.  (xx) (copy) (xx) (here...) (xx) (fold) (xx) alright uh the first part of the question is uh what kinds of observation, or changes in properties allow you to infer that a complexation reaction has occurred. so uh, this first part yeah the reason that we excluded uh zinc from this uh (manipulous) (xx) zinc originally has a full_ the zinc two class originally has a two full E shells (no) it's uh (itself) it's colorless, so uh there won't be any color change even if we uh, have any (compact form) (xx) cuz there will be no shift of color or wavelength. okay (he's) actually talking about the second question here which is uh, (xx) (question?) (yeah...) yeah um, so, don't go away yet. um, you said that, you can infer color change for post-transition also? um yeah we had for our transition metals and, post-transition metals excluding,   i mean, our_ actually we are saying uh we are including those without color (xx) like uh, aluminum zinc um yeah. actually there are more, more than that more than those two. which are colored as ice. yeah so how do you infer that (uh) what are the two ways you infer (that a) infer a complexation reaction with? post-transition metals if they're colorless? um... if we add base to cations mhm that doesn't necessarily imply that it complexed (one) it means that you're just reversing the precipitation reaction, right?     yeah but you wanna make it more general for the_ all post-transitions, um because they are colorless, mhm (yes...) okay (xx) what? how can you tell if N-H-three, complexes with transitions (isn't) the only way to like precipitate like (xx) O-H (xx) what? i di- didn't  (you) haven't seen (xx) (in the way that they can)  okay.  (xx) you (could) also if you added O-H, uh we've learned that O-H is a stronger, um, (xx) well i mean as as far as heavy metals dissolving oh right part three, on this experiment was intended to specifically show you that certain things can and cannot complex, um but predicting whether a complex is formed with post-transitions we haven't done (xx) okay.  (i) (xx) (whether or not it complexes?) like for (xx) oh, i i think i know what you're getting to. are you speaking in reference to like aluminum plus-three?    yeah. yeah um actually, those two are really good precipitating agents (xx) (this) the first place. but Lewis base acidity, is dependant on the species and it doesn't necessarily imply that (it'll) (form a) precipitate, if it's a good Lewis base. so N-H-three is an extremely good Lewis base, so it can displace that precipitating agent, um pretty readily, for most things, um and as you, as we'll see further in this discussion of, you'll notice that, in part three actually there's a a preference for which, for which metals on the periodic table will show that tendency to precip- or uh to um complex with N-H-three or O-H. or O-H, right. so if like the the precipitating agent doesn't really affect, the results (or of the) (right) but it sorta does, like (we saw) the difference between  (xx) right. alright (xx) yeah i think the best way to think about it is if you have a precipitate, and you pour base on it, and that precipitate disappears, then you know that whatever you poured on it was a better Lewis base. okay so if you were given a list of Lewis bases, um in_ from greatest to to weakest, uh you would you would say okay well the greatest one would dissolve a precipitate form with a a weaker one. right? um it's you probably won't see anything like that on a test right now, because it, that, concept's kinda vague, from this experiment but um, that's just the way it happens. so should we have seen (different) results with the precipitating agents and the same metal and same um (make?) (uh) could you repeat that question  probably not. unless the precipitating agent was, a stronger Lewis base than, uh what precipitated aluminum. do you see what i mean? yeah um N-H-three is actually one of the best Lewis bases. so. and O-H-minus actually if you recall from, i think procedure, one or two, from um, part two, y- you can infer that, N-H-three is a better Lewis base than (the) O-H-minus. for, the transition metals.  yep. right. (what?) (xx) i don't know. (xx) okay so the first part is um, is there a link between a cation's tendency to (complex) with O-H or N-H-three and the acidity of the cation? um and and basically what we've, what we think is that the more acidic or the lower the P-H, um the more likely it is to complex. um and what we did um for the for the charge for both of the charges we combined the precipitate to complex and the complex the_ we combined those two, um uh, um uh areas um and so you can kind of by doing that you can kind of see the trend, um since we, we ordered the um the areas that (xx) to be um least reactive to the more reactive. uh no reaction obviously no reaction precipitate there's somewhat of a reaction, and in the precipitate the complex on the complex, um, both of the the data was a little weird so we were having trouble finding the trends, and that's why we combined the two so you can kind of see the trends, um in both, um... now i guess it's heavy i have a question. yep. uh yes. okay. good.  um actually i would like to make a quick note. uh transition N-A-O-H. uh you see that some people reported it precipitates complex? only true for zinc. not true for any of the others that we tested. (it's) impossible it was (a) misinterpretation of the experiment that led to that, that data point. so bear that in mind. i was, maybe if you, i don't know if (s- y- uh,) do you understand like what this chart is showing or not. (like) i don't know. cuz like with these X's are correspond to these two (here,) and that means transitions and family twos, for (recorded) precipitate and this is the transitions and heavies, were the only ones that formed complex (xx) yeah the X is just the (mo-) it's the most predominant  yeah (just quick) okay. the next part of the question, was um, based on your answer predict if palladium two-plus will complex, and, palladium, is, can you see that? you might wanna lift it up a little higher. okay this ignore the stuff on the bottom yeah. that can be dealt with. okay, palladium is a transition metal, it's number forty-six, there, so, we predicted that... read the other (two math problems) (mhm...) (xx) (i guess you didn't do that one) oh, (didn't) we do it? (xx) (xx) got the (head) goal (xx) okay well, um... if it follows the trend, then most likely in sodium hydroxide since it's (a) transition metal, it's gonna, um it's going to form a complexation reaction, and or (xx) it's either gonna form a precipitate or a precipitate to complex with N-A-O-H as you see there. and... we didn't get any results that it just formed a precipitate with ammonia so (xx) (complex before) (xx)   the last part of the question, uh lead is extremely toxic in humans lead poisoning is usually treated with, (xx) (cladding) any  cool. (xx) i cannot emphasize how important it is, for you to realize that only zinc, can go from precipitate to complex none of the other transition metals will. okay? (xx) N-O-H with N-O-H. (xx) N-A-N-O-H N-A-O-H so, you will not see precipitate complexes on a transition metal with N-A-O-H, period. (xx) only with N-H-three. well that doesn't really form precipitate you will not see precipitate. you will       no it does not go from, if you had copper hydroxide and you add more hydroxide, (you should) (xx) you should have  it stays precipitate yep yep. so (what-) how people interpreted that when they add acid (xx)  okay, um we're also supposed to summarize the class data from part three... um and basically what we're doing in part three was considering whether, um, the process of um converting insoluble metal compound to soluble complex is more related to the cation's acidity or to its ability to complex with N-H-three or O-H-minus. and so we had to take our information from our first and second part of the lab, to make our hypothesis (xx) um which basically found that the P-H is going to increase, from, the left side of the, periodic table, and also and break_ (xx) in this part (xx) see (xx) one has the higher P-H average, and then, um, it decreases to the right. and then, also, we, um as was just discussed with the recent groups, um the reactions with N-A-O-H or N-H-three-plus. so, then in part three what we did was we kinda we com- we kinda compared the both of them, um come up with how when it's combined with an insoluble metal compound, if it's going_ if the precipitate would then be soluble. and we found that in family one, it was very soluble and we never even had a precipitate when we mixed it so that that was plenty and then in, family number two it never dissolved and there was no precipitate and then in the transitions in the heavy metals it depended on whether it was mixed with N-H-three or N-A-O-H, but it didn't necessarily matter what the the metal compound was because in all cases N-H-three, it_ the precipitate was dissolved for the transition metals and for the heavy metals so in all cases of N-A-O-H, the precipitate was dissolved. um so based on this information we, would, um as far as predicting salt solubility, um if we know the cation's acidity, we would say if we know the cation's acidity then we could place it into an area, on the periodic table as we've seen, if it's a higher P-H then we're gonna assume that it's gonna be, in the, family one area which then we would predict would be very soluble whereas if it's got a, um low P-H then we would assume that it's towards, the heavy, metals heavy end and then we would think that it would be soluble in N-A-O-H. or if it's a little higher then we'd think it would be transition then (it would) be soluble in N-H-three. and that would also be fairly easy to test because that's, you remember in the lab when you just kinda mixed the, two together and see which one it is. so it'd also be useful for identifying whatever it is that you're trying to, make soluble. second part of the question is, it says that okay. the first part. drawing, the reaction. look at our nickel two-plus, combining with N-H-three, which is a Lewis base and has two electrons that it can, share with this Lewis acid which wants some, and, the result of this reaction is nickel, and the N-H-three. we think there's still gonna be the two-plus charge there, and    yeah, but we didn't get that information, for the question so, whatever it is would be  six. okay. so (uh) if it's six then in that case it's gonna be, it's gonna be N-I, and then it's gonna have you're gonna have six water molecule attached to that, and then the uh, N-H-three is gonna react with that, and then this is gonna (replace) right here (so we get) N-I and it's gonna be, N-H-three-subscript-six with a, charge of plus-two and then you're gonna have, those six waters added on, to the, peroxide. indeed. the second part of the question was about magnesium two-plus. and it said that it was slightly acidic and our average was five-point-seven-three and it should not complex. so we, gathered a little more information on it it's from family two, and when combined with N-H-three, we get no reaction. and when combined with N-A-O-H, we get a precipitate and then a complex. and this, right here, the combination with a N-A-O-H, does not support, this conclusion... so we got a a yes and a no. so we don't know what to make of that... and this is this is from the data... okay? do you have (s-) copy of the data...? (um all we used was um) t- to determine this cuz it wasn't mixed with an insoluble (xx) we used part two when we were just mixing it with N-H-three and N-A-O-H, which bas- um i don't know if the group before probably has better data, does depicting that but (with) we had right here (it's) family two, with N-A-O-H (xx) precipitate complex with no reaction N-H (xx) and that's why we got (xx) okay... any questions? (okay,) we have question five and it's like can you predict the salt solubility in a base if you know the cation's tendency to form complexes? what we did was we looked at the data from, part three t- or part two to see what the tendency of each cation was to form a complex in, either N-A-O-H or N-H-three. and we saw that family ones didn't form complexes in either base because there was no precipitate, at all. family two, didn't form a complex on either one. transition cations formed complexes in N-H-three and heavy metals formed complexes in N-H-four. in N-H-three we also noticed that there in the family three cations we noticed that there was um split in the (pass A to a change in) precipitate (and) precipitate to complex in the, N-A-O-H solution, and we think this (error) was probably because, a lot of like the things that know the difference between, what a precipitate was versus what a precipitate to complex was where it should've been just a precipitate and the same thing for, the heavy metals in N-H-three, and then knowing the cation's tendency to form complex as well allowed us predict its salt solubility, because if a cation forms a complex in a certain base it's (oft- and) salt will dissolve in that base, so, since family one's cations didn't form a complex in anything, they didn't precipitate (xx) nothing to dissolve (xx) dissolve in either base, family two cations form precipitates in both, K-two-C-O-three, and K-two-C-two-O four, but because they didn't form a complex in (either) N-A-O-H or N-H-three (neither) of the two precipitates dissolved. and (in) family three, elements form precipitates again with both of the precipitating reagents, and since we know that they form complexes in N-H-three we know that_ the salts were soluble in N-H-three, and for the heavy metals, we had a precipitate with both precipitating reagents and formed (a compounds) (xx) N-A-O-H therefore it was soluble in (the) N-A-O-H... uh okay the second part says actually (xx) basic solutions (xx) well (n- it) (xx) acidic i mean if you add acid to acid nothing would happen right? hm (xx) (xx) (try to) (xx) (um) (so) (xx) well see the thing is is in basic solutions, you have an abundance of (like) negative charges that um when y- when you add a base (right from the) acid_ acidic solution, you're you're removing a lot of uh the positive charges, b- and then if it becomes basic enough what defines base, is the concentration of O-H-minus. alright?  right.   (and would form) a   mhm yeah. okay. no. okay. so, P-B-two-plus where is it? post-transition or transition? post-transition. post-transition. so what is it more soluble in? from your experiment. what is it more soluble in? N-A-O-H right? sodium hydroxide. what defines, a basic solution? what is the definition of a base?   right so what happens to the (xx) yeah wh- what i mean he had the lead solution what happened to the (xx) (capacitor then?) (xx) had (xx) um  it may. it might.  right. okay... yeah. alright. and, my groups, three and four are doing, question six right? come on down. come on down okay the first part of our question was to present our interpretation of the (direction) of copper sulfate and, potassium iodide. okay uh we believe that, okay first of all we observed that white P-P-T in brown solution, was observed, then after that we believe that the iodide was oxidized from, I- I-minus to I-two and copper was reduced from C-U-two-plus to C-U-plus. um and we checked from referring to the C-R-C handbook we found that the only possible P-P-T between copper two-plus and iodine minus is copper iodine. which is, C-U-I. okay in order to confirm our, observation, uh we we give two experiment (to the test) which is copper sulfate plus potassium nitrate, uh to prove that iodide is needed to form the, P-P-T and, sodium sulfate plus potassium iodide to show that C-U-two-plus is needed to form the, P-P-T. when we add h- h- hexane to the solution, the solution forms two layer a purple layer, which we assume that is hexane plus iodide and a brown layer which is uh water and copper iodine. and when we check again from the C-R-C handbook we found that uh C-U-I is brownish insoluble and soluble in ammonia. which matches our prediction... that's it... alright the second part of our question, uh it states it is a fact when N-H-three is added to a_ a precipitate of uh C-U-C-L-three, the precipitate dissolves. and they want us to offer an explanation based on our investigation of the reaction and the knowledge gained from the class results in part three. alright there's a few things to uh keep in mind when we think about the reaction, and that is that Lewis acids want to join with the best possible Lewis base that they're uh in solution with, uh in this reaction C-U-plus-two is a Lewis acid, and N-H-three is a much better Lewis base than the uh carbonate, uh so therefore the C-U-plus-two will uh break away from the carbonate in order to join with the N-H-three, to form the uh complex ion, uh shown there, which happens to be soluble, and that will cause the precipitate to break up and disappear because the, copper's no longer joined, with the carbonate, (can) you raise that up (xx) with the bottom. okay. uh then we rechecked our data in part three to confirm this, and it's a little hard to read but uh it's a ch- could you put your uh, transparency up from uh reaction part four, um could you explain, um what role the N-H-three plays? the N-H-three? uh we basically (processed a reverse reduct.) from uh C-U-plus to C-U-two-plus. (xx) i- in doing that what what's your observation for the hexane layer? what happens to the hexane layer, does it become clear does it stay purple? it became clear. it became clear. (yeah) uh because the I-minus uh was able to become I-two again,    mhm th- the real the real reason for this reaction going backwards um, is up for debate the people who who don't study this kinda thing but, who are chemists can argue about it, but you don't have to know why it happened just that it did. just that you observed it going backward and forward. when you added acid it went back again it just showed you that there's a Lewis Lewis complexes, Lewis acid base reaction (xx) (that's it...) (xx) so uh... you guys all did a very good job today. i'm very proud of you (xx) alright um let me tell you uh real quick, uh you're gonna be back here at one Lucy's gonna be lecturing for an hour and then we're gonna be doing analysis of reactions don't worry about today it's gonna be fun everyone has the most fun in this reaction. you're gonna be giving you're gonna be given reactions and it's up to you to figure out we're not gonna tell you anything more than to do the reaction but it's gonna be up to you to fill it out. we'll go into more detail on how you're gonna fill all this out, um when you get down there you're only gonna be writing up four reactions today and presenting the fifth. um, but we'll go over that in class so you can fill out the sheets please remember to turn in your sheets up front you're grading sheets so finish those um please none of my students leave yet. oh yeah uh_ oh yeah i also we also need you to fill out these evaluation forms. yes (no quiz?) no quiz today... we just thought we'd save that telling you that now so you'd fill out nice evaluations.  your hair's cute did you get it cut? right right, (we do that) no it looks, it looks shorter, like, like you got it layered right here but... like no, i'm trying to get rid of it (xx) okay well then i'm just an idiot don't pay  thank you, thank you (xx) huh? (i) need your laboratory discussions. (and for) my students come up here because it'll just be easier for me to pass these out. cuz i'm not supposed to go to your seat or anything like that. i need someone to volunteer  i dropped EECS two-eighty i dropped EECS two-eighty (xx) for the fall? yeah and my professor (xx) (xx) (to) introductory I-O-E uhuh but the thing is (xx) it's only offered, during the times that physics one-forty is offered oh i don't know what to do (Alexis) i'm gonna go talk (to him) i (xx) maybe ergonomics no i think (i got it) cuz that i can do the physics (xx) that's my only e- engineering class and i wanted to have something more (xx) can i borrow this quickly (xx) like (xx) one-forty in, winter how am i gonna (xx) i have to take one-forty in winter nuh-uh yuh-huh you do? you're like the only (xx) the only person i know that, like is in the class who doesn't have to take the exam i really miss spring. really? can i borrow the stapler one more time? can i borrow it one more time?   here you can like (he) doesn't care, it's just like there's (a) but i took two (xx) i (xx) took it in the winter term (if ) i took it again two thirty-one (xx) one-forty (and) (xx) see i need to okay the thing is i can't do that (xx) one-forty see i need to i'm taking two-forty in the fall (xx) cuz i've i had like ish (alright) i got a C-minus (in) physics one-forty and you need at least a C, (xx) hopefully i'll take   (yet.) yeah. oh you're kidding me. i think that's what someone was telling me. the thing is... i', gonna ask cause if i don't take engineering, then you gotta take physics, one-forty, and i'll take a two-forty, and what i'll do is i'll take um the I-O-E intro and ergonomics. do you have an extra pencil? because you're so prepared all the time? so, um, so (i'm not gonna show 'em that) yeah but don't do that um, do i need t- if i don't take one-forty i take, i take um two-oh-one. two-oh-one? well two-oh-one-two-oh-two  it's just the yeah two-oh-one and then, i take ergonomics my roommate's (xx) two-oh-one? two-oh-one two-oh-two but that means, that means (in) um, in the  yeah no you won't you'll be a sophomore next year. no because i (can't cuz,) (in winter) (xx) right? in fall. winter term i'll take one-forty. (that means)  yeah. but then and then in spring i'll take two-forty-one. and then in, (um,) fall i'll take two-forty. (take) two forty and two forty one (xx) together (xx) it's not hard i know people who (are taking it) they said it's  (i don't know) (this prof) one-sixteen like is (kind of ) right now? but then but now they're working my butt 	1
MTG425JG004.json	well, is everyone happy with if i_ you can look at what i've already started, to write up for the problem statement, mhm we can always add, and  (xx) it's right there i think one person, in, in this case you,  okay  and it's only a draft (so you know) if, sure and   mhm...    um, we hafta work on our goal, too and maybe we should do that as a group because Glenda had, the good point that it seems to presume, um, presumes that restoration, is... is a definite outcome. it's just the first sentence she doesn't like. yeah, i- but i mean, a- she_ it's not that she doesn't a- it's not that she doesn't like what we're saying it's just how we're saying it... we've got to, sort of um... put a spin on it that is more open-ended. okay mhm, yeah but (isn't it...) G- Glenda really has a problem with it? i was um let's see, what i so what i tried to do was to work from our from the problem sorta the problem statement, into a goal. and, we have a sentence in the problem statement now that says, that identifies MEANDRS' goal, mhm mhm (i mean) i think it doesn't, it doesn't a- address that, that, Glenda's concerns. yeah mhm mhm    mhm, i can't find something what are you looking for? something that i wrote. why don't we just, why don't we just define, as our goal well, i think one way to m- maybe make it easier is, in the, problem statement we defined, MEANDRS' objectives, and i and i think that's good. and i don't think we need to really rehash those in our goal. okay mhm i- i- if we just eliminate, the part of the goal, of the   okay.  so you would just say m- instead of, you know to assist them. yep mhm okay  that doesn't, look good see that was the problem i was having. when i would just try to take it out, then you would sort of lose the  yeah to the sounds good. i like it. does that sound, mhm   let me just rephrase this let's just write it up here or something so we can, take (note of it) so what is it? to evaluate existing conditions or, yeah or assess or, yeah, i think assess. you want identify? i don't know... assess kinda sounds like you're gonna, judge it yep (from future) rehabilitation effort? um n- well then that's getting into the presumption, (you know) if you say  okay  um  i came across um, i know we had problems with pros and cons before yeah okay i don't know, it was just another practical opportunities? possibilities. two Ss? uh yes (okay) so_ or maybe you know even just possibilities and limitations or, something i don't know. um yeah we're not biased now. yeah what is a feasibility study? it's... i mean i i think you can- i don't think there's any set, definition of a feasibility study but essentially you're just identifying, the limitations and, constraints, of a of a proposed, um, a you know proposed project, to determine whether or not, it_ you know and then, depending on what your_ you consider your your ultimate constraint, is it financial? is it, public acceptance? i think it's, y- you know based on your constraints, can can this project be done? i was thinking we could even maybe just cut the middle sentence out. okay mhm or you know we could, we could essentially leave, leave this out. yeah cuz yeah, i think,  what if we put in here to predict, potential changes, you know, limitations, and possibilities? i, i think, like if we're gonna do the whole like start narrow and and, and expand as we go out if we just leave it as, potential changes, um... because i think the limitations and possibilities    that's including, this? yeah. i mean that's just my take on it. okay yeah that's what i that's valid. what i think, i- is that feasibility encompasses, most of what is there you know mkay cuz i mean, the first sentence so we say the  what? i mean the first sentence is basically our goal is to like,  right identify, i don't like the word identify  (xx) uh... oh usually my English is, not, okay the problem is is that, when you get into syntax, it becomes, whoever's reading it is gonna interpret  (is to) describe, or,   but describe also also implies, mm, basically that all the information is all the things that, are laid out right, and we could come up and, describe them. what about determine? no determine's very, rigid. yeah hm examine. examine? that's kind of like it is a little bit better i would agree. more like explore how 'bout explore? what about analyze? that's very yeah that's uh explore's kinda neat. explore to me is more of a journey, it's kinda like, you're, uh, you don't know what you're gonna find, you don't know, you know and there's like sort of no defined end point to exploring it's just... examine when i think of examine i think of, someone looking under a microscope. okay okay  yeah, i don't like the last two.  you know we can also we can digest this for a little while right  yeah let's just put explore in there   yeah      mm yeah, um so uh, um... yeah, of course i have uh, my favorite word, but uh, um, i don't know, my choices are (appro-) more appropriate  okay. okay. yeah okay. so, uh, becau- not why. um the current and historical conditions, are not so clear, i think. so, um, we must, we must, search, uh what i- what, what are the current and historical conditions, so explore is more appropriate. okay, yeah okay historical conditions?  i don't know. this charac- or status, state? how 'bout oh the other thing i had written down, um yeah, that's good yeah. (xx) to use (a) watershed approach to do you hafta go? yeah. (um) yeah. (xx) okay so you'll work on the literature review stuff,  yeah, all my stuff and (then) do you need Glenda's comments? yeah cuz i think those are more_ most um applicable  i wanna s- what? d- do you guys wanna, meet, meet the three of us at all over the weekend or just wait until Monday? um i want i want to meet. okay okay, Sunday afternoon? Sunday Sunday evening? yeah Sunday, ab- Sunday at about five? what, what's your schedule on Sunday? um, Sunday,  yeah i, like last week uh i i w- i will have a r- a meeting, uh at eleven A-M.  is five o'clock good? okay no problem cuz i have a meeting at eight P-M, (xx) okay okay okay uhuh mhm  yeah yeah um okay five P-M then, yeah. um want a copy of 'em? there. (i s that Glenda's stuff?) um, actually,  oh yeah, please. do you want to just give him this one? sure okay, yeah his are um, kinda this handwriting, and Geoff's are, in there too. mine's, his are the more blocky, yeah yeah, (xx,) (these are the ones, in capitals) yeah... mine are the ones that have a lot of scribbles through them and stuff. yeah so i'll see you guys on Sunday see you okay did you do well, last night? uh, who else won? i only know that Minnesota won and that um, a- all the favorites won okay, then i did, one two  yeah.  Kentucky was the only they, yeah i fell asleep lis- Kentucky's just boring they were, they were like, winning too, easily. Kentucky was the only one (that,) U-C-L-A was losing by sixteen, at one point. they came back but they came back. so i_ that wasn't g- i picked i had, o- on one of mine i had um, i had Iowa State, (xx) one i had U-C-L-A they came back, and (xx,) it was, like to the last second did you watch that game? yeah what time did it get over? like at nine. it was so, weird. they were up by, they were up by, by, two, right? U-C-L-A? U-C-L-A. yeah with, like, four seconds left, (xx) and then, um, they fouled somebody th- Iowa State (just like) fouled somebody, so they went, they went (xx) missed one two U-C-L-A guys, got the rebound, and they were fighting for the ball,  to Iowa? to Iowa State with four seconds down one. so they inbound from, from the um, okay, i think so we'll talk ab- we can talk about it. okay? okay yeah um, physical tasks, are missing. mhm um, well let's, let's work on getting the the methods, mhm mhm    mhm. this is actually this was Pat. uhuh... green, green writing is? is Geoff. Geoff, okay i had an idea, for this, um that (cord's) kind of a hazard. does it come out?     i i can there's one behind you there. oh Hiro? hm? okay this_ now Martin can trip over it. (xx) Martin um... to predict, potential changes that may result from rehabilitation... or that could,  to or and? i think and (xx) (entities)   yeah. does that sound good? mhm Hiro, do you like that? yeah okay is that written down somewhere  (could put) it in i can put th- i'll put that in... actually should   yeah i like the beginning, yeah what put watershed-based,  i've heard it like so many different ways, i think it's    yeah i mean i've heard it used, watershed-based watershed approach,   do you wanna get together y- just like you and i, on, Monday morning and, sorta, like we did last week and just sort of put everything together? yeah we could do that um,  yeah. yeah, i think you are th- you and i are the only ones   okay pull it together, and then any extra time we have we can,  okay Geoff? yes? um, before pre- predict yeah no i don't think it is necessary, because we're not, to would mean, um, well i was, having  i was trying to get rid of some of the tos yeah,    mhm yeah uhuh okay. uhuh okay.   Hiro, it's one of the finer points, of grammar   it's, it's  okay    i think that would be it is by, by by using  yeah, to explore the goal is by,  okay right well that's one rea- that's_ you could put it here and then, say, a goal, the goal is to explore the current and  oh  yeah uhuh mhm i think with you have this to here, and this to here, i think that, makes it okay. okay uhuh, yeah  do you understand? yeah  mhm okay... yeah i've_ actually, i need to, get some stuff so i've got about half an hour left, okay okay what was that Martin? um, do we wanna, go over the objectives? um, or figure out who's gonna work on, which part, or we kinda work on our own parts i guess but... um  and we also say the Dowagiac river   okay because, you know we took out um okay yeah okay i think we can b- we can bring this into our problem statement and our objectives and (like,) and just make it clear up front and also wa- we wanted to also bring in water, water, quality, cuz Glenda po- pi- mhm water, i think, can i put it there? (oh yeah) (on the) water quality yeah, okay, so, i guess our objectives are still to... determine how, rehabilitation okay you wanna w- ca- let's work off  yeah. there's a... yeah okay (xx) i'm using green. we should all (like) pick a color. that, sorta stands out oh okay um, you can use blue. um, so, with this goal in mind... do we wanna add in a an objective to, explore to explore, the current and historical characteristics, and then... um, and have that as a goal, or an objective, and then, to lead on from that, okay okay mhm, (xx) okay um, determine how determine  yeah. now, i- Pat was concerned that objective two and j- objective three, three mhm, right or the, why don't we, since they are_ they_ i mean there's a fine point between, sort of identifying things, and judging them. yeah we could either combine 'em or i just simply put in, you know we could say instead of identify quanta- you know i- quantifying, it's kinda hard, it kinda depends how, you define, mhm right in the big picture, (or,) you know, that's    right, okay  right okay. to, maybe, um establish?  uh, e- evaluate? evaluate right i uh, i uh think that's what we wanna say. yeah, so let's try evaluate there. and, let's just leave it really, really simple (it)   (xx) this is,  okay, identify, we can change that again, to change it to explore, or um, identify okay... examine possible, effects of restoration... cuz that's, examine's like, okay, okay okay, well okay take take it out. okay this is the same it's the same thing we were just doing. right i don't think explore quite works there though. no. mm, maybe list? (xx) mhm um, isn't, evaluate appropriate? um,  mhm  mhm  uhuh okay  like ba- just, so i remember those words based on our research and, knowledge (xx...) and (xx) of the system, (xx?) yeah, just, leave it there in case we wanna stick something like that in there. okay. um... can you predict, possible effects of restoration? that's more, see that's more the next, right this is, or, this is  yeah, so i was thinking here predict possible effects. okay. i don't know i just took it from down there. yeah, okay, no that's sounds good predict... is that what we used up there? yeah... predict, p- or potential, possible? predict possible effects of restoration on the social, socioeconomic well, okay predict possible, let's just put it in there predict possible changes that could, result from rehabilitation, that's where we'll put, that's where we'll put,   yeah yeah okay, yeah okay hm? no no no, this is, this is, this is pros and cons. yeah, but so is this one this is_ i just changed the (page.) (xx) right. isn't practical  uh i was thinking of using that as a, a synonym for pros and cons. possibilities and limitations. oh okay. but... now what were you saying? that's fine. no i see what you're saying.  sh- b- yeah just just throw it in there with our other words, yeah i like limitations but i don't like possibilities      correct yeah   it's sort of_ it's got a cross over between ecology and social,  yeah right. mhm   yeah. mhm  mhm yeah. that sounds good... so i think Glenda just saw it sort of floating out there, yeah  especially since there wasn't anything underneath it. right.  i think so as opposed to bullets. yeah. bullets_ they kind of said task circle which  yeah right... okay. oh i i guess we should a- maybe we should fill in Hiro a little bit on, mhm uhuh...  uhuh mhm  right. so, the way that they_ we sort of all of us, decided that the methods are more conceptual, mhm okay. uhuh okay. mhm  mhm      okay,  uhuh  mhm  uhuh   okay. and what we were gonna_ we're gonna focus on, objectives, predominantly objectives, and then methods, and we'll worry about tasks, mhm  okay, okay, i see. and then time line and budget, after we've done the tasks... okay thanks. yeah. sorry i forgot to yeah no uh'uh. yeah um, i i am uh i can_ i could imagine uh from Glenda's comment. okay. mhm. okay.   we didn't get into that and  right. mhm  right  mhm okay mhm. okay... and uh, Glenda m- m- mentioned, our li- our literature re- review, mhm mhm right.  uhuh about halfway down  in quotes   okay. not so much specific articles, mhm,  yeah. mhm the effects of agricultural runoff, yeah  um, so  mhm  okay. okay. mm so she told us uh to choose uh our interest topic?  okay. um, she, i think what she said was, we just had, a list,  mhm okay i (see.) mhm  she wants to know where we're going with the literature, okay.  mhm   mhm yes. okay. it's like what information we intend to get out of  i see. (easy.) um, okay so that was objective six was was pretty good mm (you have to go?) uh couple_ i could_ like, ten minutes. okay... why don't we um... what was your ins- it's kinda hard_ i still think like in a sense maybe just Pat doesn't know yet, how he feels about it, but that, you don't really have to have, a a scientific hypothesis, right mhm yeah and then mhm right.  yes. okay. you know maybe would restoring MEANDRS to the Dowagiac system be a feasible method for rehabilitating? ins- as opposed to will restoring? yeah. okay... yeah ye- yes. and then that's not as, definite that it's gonna happen. or reha- we gotta get rehabilitation    of the Dowagiac, river system, be a feasible,  approach... (xx,) for... for MEANDRS. cuz we're we're just, you know we're trying to answer_ their question is, is... is rehabilitation, the way to go? yeah... for MEANDRS, to, pursue.  to reach their goal? i don't think that necessarily to reach it just to  goal of, and then go back to our problem statement. rehabilitating and preserving the integrity of the watershed? how about improving or how about um, enhancing, protecting, improving, of yeah...  (xx) economic, agricultural, um isn't it needs isn't that the end? needs... of the  (xx.) alright let's... um, changes resulting from, rehabilitation... Glenda had a comment on that one.  i think he took it but i've got a copy. (xx) no i think it was just a specific comment  oh. okay. okay. mm okay... and then i think this one's okay okay okay, um, methods yeah. yes. yeah for what? restoration options scenarios type oh um... um  now, um, Glenda indicate indicates you don't discuss possible alternatives, mhm we talked about that. yeah uhuh  what what we decided Hiro, um... Pa- Pat seemed to think it was really important to look at it as a system, mhm  mhm  mhm  mhm okay mhm yeah,   mhm, mhm okay.  okay... mhm  okay does that make sense? okay... um... so i think with these, we need to, save all of this, and we can use that in a in the task (yep) yeah well yeah   like baseline information on river flow, and, um, it it's sort of it's sorta the same stuff but without um (xx)   review maps, review maps, um, talk to people look at photographs, yep. yeah. again sort of, what we um, how we attend how we intend to uh, to, to meet our objectives... okay mhm mhm (xx) mhm  mhm mhm... okay  um a question. how uh ho- how we will, how will we_ how will we, um answer our research questions?  we have an extra, objective in here too.   okay  um, we, created a new objective mhm mhm  um yes current and historical, characteristics okay... the_ i i was just going through what we talked about yesterday. mhm okay. okay.  okay. so, what we're gonna do okay and ano- Hiro, and the other way that it was phrased was, a conceptual discussion of the approach, that you'll take. mhm okay... okay... yeah. yeah. okay, that helps... um... okay actually i'm gonna hafta go, okay uhuh. okay. lemme just write down... objectives (that we need) let me just (xx) (fix up)  i think that's okay cuz, okay okay okay. okay. um, do you wanna meet at like eight thirty on Monday? yeah. or i- what's the_ when do you usually get in? and i'll just it, depends eight thirty's, okay i didn't know whether you were there actually earlier um, i mean sh- i can be, probably not then. okay. that's okay.  Monday morning okay. okay. (cool) (can i) meet you at NUBS again? okay. okay... and uh, um, for Monday, uh, when w- will we meet uh for (later) class? four o'clock? four thirty.  we have class on Monday at four thirty. oh it's a master's (xx)   they're gonna talk about presentations uhuh okay. okay... do you guys know yet when you'll be presenting? um i sent  yeah on the thirty-first. (xx) mhm... but that hasn't been confirmed yet. if that's when we, i'm just thinking more people probably want to go later than early. i don't think we'll have a problem yeah... okay... um, Geoff um mor- um sorry. Ma- Martin? yes. may i keep this? yeah i need to make a copy of that. okay okay  okay. okay... okay well thanks a lot for, working on this, this weekend too. mhm  wanna take my snowshoes?  got your waders? yep those too. okay. (excuse me) (xx) (your way,) okay i'll see you    yeah you too. bye so do you want to come over with me while i make a copy of that and then i'll give it to you or do you want me to leave it in your  which is easier? oh, thanks. which is would you wanna_ me to leave it in your mail folder or do you wanna just come with me? um yeah i wi- i will go with  	1
SGR175SU123.json	sorry we could only get the old book. oh that's okay. okay. um, you kn- that oxyl acetate, you know that, there's like a, a weird cycle. it's, it sorta seems  no, it's something, sort of related to it but it's not, it. okay oh oh,   for the fatty acid breakdown right? uh yeah, i   glyoxylate? yeah,  the purpose of it? or  right, right okay, so, some of the same enzymes are involved, okay okay okay    that i- that's what it appears to be so, A-T-P would inhibit that cuz i- is it cuz it bi- it binds to that, or or something? it probably binds to the enzyme, okay   yeah, so and it's it's an allosteric inhibitor. oh okay   okay  right, so we have C-O-two yeah  doesn't it have six? right it g- okay let's look at the, structure.  ci- yeah like, i think this one's the one that leaves. which one's the one? the middle one? the new one? no the middle one, here right right... so what does that mean? that it changes, shape? right so, this is your substrate citrase, citrate and, aconitase the enzyme, okay okay   right, and that's catalyzed by, this  okay. so that was so then you have another carbon, leaving, sa- it's ca- like the step name is called the same oxidative decarboxylation, but it's a, by a different enzyme has  oh okay okay? what other one? the, this one   mhm hi actually if you'd rather fill them out, when you leave okay no problem. is that okay? that's fine. okay okay i got an old book, okay.  okay, so, um, so like, i know those, when it go- it goes from here, so this is the gly- glyoxylate cycle so this is the whole citric acid cycle right.  isn't this to like, sort of maintain, this in the cell? right does it only happen in plants? or was it something else? i think you might be right it only happens in plants  okay so not in, not in mammals or (whatever) um, it doesn't, does the glyoxylate cycle take place in mammals, or just plants? or animals at all? the, glyoxylate cycle? do you know what that is? no yeah i did  what's that? (xx) no. okay  this is the citric acid cycle. yeah oh. okay? and it says in plants it's, in these organelles called glyoxosomes, um, can something inhibit this? probably oh okay   oh  we can't  oh, then what process do we use  oh.   yeah,  i don't, think so.  (oh)  yeah, we'll learn that later. so what're we gonna go over, for today? um, well he had some questions first so we're gonna, continue with that. and you're like, teach me. we're not doing that. why not? it's the best way s- and this one uh, sort of. is this just like,   oh so these things, do these things come from that or this, makes that? well  it's going that way but, right we can make those too oh we can? yeah oh okay. and this,   right.  do plants have mitochondria? they    we can do that. okay yeah, yeah and then, yeah that's all i had   oh okay but i- it's possible oh okay. what do the red arrows mean? why are some red and some blue? anaplerotic means both ways, so... maybe that's the enzyme, like C yeah.  is it, so it means it just goes both ways though. right? like, the reaction can go, backwards   what's the word? anaplerotic and then  A-N-A. and then the Q cycle, th- that's ubiquinol right? that's not for plants. what's not for plants? the Q cycle or whatever the Q cycle. you know the one where ubiquinol carries electrons that's the is that the Q cycle or i thought it was   yeah ubiquinol? the c- no, the Q cy- isn't the Q cycle ubiquinol? yeah, that's what it's also called though. i thought it starts in three. i thought it was like right here and like, complex three was like, over here and this is like, Q is like right there oh, i don't know i i th- s- we'll go over that. yeah okay. well ubiquinone is after the comple- after complex one, so and, what's the other one, quinone is just, like we had to fill in like yeah so go,  i put that in complex three, an- cuz i- i don't know, cuz did you use the book? yeah well that's where i thought i- it would go. did you find out what anaplerotic meant? it told me to go to this page but,  anaplerotic? yeah like  oh, so it's a reaction that, if you run out of something, it could still go backwards.  like N-A-D to N-A-D-H, like you have to go back? no, it's no- that's not what back_ that's not what it means.   right so these are, some anaplerotic reactions, and where they take place. oh okay  oh okay. okay? okay. so let's, figure out, oh that's not it. um, the, this guy. (second?) yeah should i draw you oxal- citrate acid cycle? yeah let's see it. okay can you do it? i don't know all the little enzyme things but, i think i've got, the gist of it. our exam's next week right? yup coenzyme A. is it? isn't it acetyl,  does it, they're different right? they are different. acetyl, CoA has coenzyme A attached to it  i don't know A C E T Y L right. this isn't English class you have to know how to spell them though is it alpha, keto something or other? right,  gluterate? right. and in that case (xx) that was right... now that's not right how do you spell it? wha- wher- he's trying to spell oxaloacetate. isn't there an L? oxaloacetate? well whatever we know what that word is w- spell it out. ox- no, spell it out. say the word and spell it out. alright. there's an O is it phonetically, do you spell it phonetically? right   O, acetate that's not right you forgot an O, y- right? right how do you oxaloacetate. oh ox- wh- where does the O go before or after the L? yeah  no say the word. oxaloacetate, oxalo- ace- is it oxylacetate or oxaloacetate? oxalo- oxalo- right? okay is that basically it? is that it? acetyl CoA, uh citrate isocitrate, (xx) mm yeah. i think that's right very good  i'm impressed. so, tell me the enzymes that do this. you can't use your book. oh that's (a hard one) okay, what how do you get acetyl CoA from pyruvate? isn't it, pyruvate dehydrogenase? right. so how many enzymes are, actually in that complex? that's not just one  right.  coenzyme A?  mm. oh, M, M-G pl- plus or whatever, (that is)   or is it some (other)    okay, so, um, how do you get citrate from acetyl CoA? what enzyme catalyzes that reaction? some kind of (xx) we're making citrate. some kind of a, there's a decarboxylation,  isn't there? don't you lose C-O-two? how many, carbons does citrate have?   six, really? six okay six. bring in?  acetyl, what is acetyl? must mean something s- it's an alcohol? acetate oh C, or how many carbons are in acetate? i know what a hemiacetal is. seven? a hemiacetal, (is half) yeah  six. no how many carbons does pyruvate have? six  so, if we had pyruvate go into acetyl CoA there's no way we can, have six carbons in acetyl CoA right? no three three does it have three? cuz that would equal six. okay if pyruvate has three yeah  takes off, H-two-O. dehydrogenase? well, that's what the complex is called but okay so each individual enzyme, what does each indivil- individual enzyme of that complex do? doesn't one of 'em phosphorylate? doesn't it have that long ar- it like attaches two parts together? right they're on opposite ends. like, you know, is that the one with three complex right? it's a complex   there was an arm thing, you're right about that. and that's what i was asking you about earlier. that's what i was thinking about... there's no A-T-P (with this) there's no A-T-P where? in the, citric acid cycle. there's no A-T-P  do you get A-T-P?   you okay, here you go. i told you you l- you lose a, a C-O-two. no you said that acetyl CoA has six carbons. oh okay but i told you you said there was decarboxylation between acetyl CoA and citrate. oh is that what i said? yeah that's what you said. oh  right. okay five, uh two. two so how do you get, acetyl CoA, which only has two carbons, to make this six carbon molecule? of citrate? of citrate right. how do you make it? must bring in four. where do the four come from? from that enzyme. from the enzyme? does the e- does an enzyme ever change in a reaction? no no what what other, substrate  say the word. is it the same one? yeah say the word. oh. oxaloa- oxaloacetate. oxaloacetate, right. yeah they come together. right yeah some kinda dehydrogenase? you're making citrate,  isosome? i don't know citrate dehydrogenase. citrate    kinase  phosphorylates? okay, so we're making citrate. so citrate, synthase? dehydrogenase   right.  phosphorylates phosphorylates? what does phosphorylase do? adds phosphorous? inorganic no it takes it out     kinases. ki- oh okay. ki- oh okay  oh okay yeah it's in the   very good. uh, so how do i get isocitrate from citrate? what enzyme do i use? oh, it's just, it i- takes off something doesn't it? no all it is is a rearrangement. right. so an enzyme has to do that. yeah um a- a-   what is it? alkinase? uh, no. no it's like A C I N O T A S E or something like that A C I or A C, A C i know it's like  okay oh okay. ac- acno- no what a- what'd they say?     i i, akal- i don't know something,  (whatever) okay how do you spell aconitase? i don't know A C O N O T A S E N O or N I? N O. I. N I. aconitase, okay? so what's the intermediate between citrate and isocitrate? sys. sys what? acitrate? s- no sys sys A sys A sys, starts with an A (aconicitrate?)  aconitase  sys what? i don't know. i just know it's called sys. does it start with a sys A? like sysaconi- no? sys what? aconitase? aconi- wh- oh that was that thing again, that was the enzyme so it's acononate. right. sysaconitate, or, kina- sysaconitate right.   it's i- it's another dehydrogenase, isn't it? decarbo- they're all like  i- the name, uh you yeah the names are very uh they use the names, right. oh okay six still? six right. how many carbons does alpha-keto-gluterate have? it has five five so what  it's a decarboxylation reaction. so it's some kinda dehy-  so, what enzyme does that? don't look. isn't it some kinda dehydrogenase? what is it? some kinda dehydrogenase? right, what kinda dehydrogenase? alpha-keto-dehydrogenase, (or) um, well no. okay isocitrate dehydrogenase? right  oh okay (yeah) do i have to know these enzymes like,  like all of 'em, for, every cycle? or anything i'd be pretty su- y- you,       okay so why don't we like go over this stuff?  oh, okay wow that's a lot    right right okay so like let's do that stuff  okay good gosh you're demanding all of a sudden. because i like, we are doing that stuff okay good okay so, next reaction what happens? how many carbons does alpha-keto-gluterate have? five how many carbons does succinyl CoA have? i think it's like five. it loses uh, like some hydrogen or something like that. isn't there like nothing in the middle now?  (that's the part) right s- well kind of basically. like all this is still the same. so you're saying you still have the same number of carbons, you've just lost some oxygens. yeah (xx) carbon dioxide right   yeah yeah right. so what enzyme catalyzes it? alpha-keto dehydrogenase... no. alpha-keto-gluterate gluterate  dehydrogenase? okay. it's a complex. okay?  you usually can. some okay okay  no.   oh, S okay, yeah  yeah yeah coenzyme A yeah yeah  S is a sulfur. it's how you attach it. okay sulfur, coenzyme A. okay. yeah, you attach coenzyme A to your sulfur. okay okay no more looking. huh okay you lose this. you lose it? (to go over) there, right? isn't it? what do you lose? the coenzyme A right... so what enzyme does that? um you're   no, synthase.  what kinda synthase? succinyl  i want to say, what reactions are reversible and what, are not? draw the double arrows in there. (xx) isn't the first one and the third one? oh no, hold on. no that's glycolysis. oh okay, oh. okay   the that's a reversible, mhm (xx) i don't think this is. you don't think that is, well you would be incorrect. okay okay you're welcome, thank you ooh, what's isn't there like patterns, that you could figure out? like, in glycolysis it was like the first one the third one that's not a pattern the s- it's a, it's not a, it's not like a pattern it's just what the cell, oh okay fumarate to malate, that would be, reversible wouldn't it? that is reversible. how can you tell which one's reversible though? just it de- it really you can't just tell oh okay so we actually have to you have to know oh okay because, you can't just tell it depends on, the env- cell environment i don't think  okay what about malate to oxaloacetate? um, i wanna say mm, no, uh yes  yes it is. thought so. and, what about succinate to fumarate? hmm... think so?   so most of the citric acid cycle is reversible. most of it is, yeah. hi hello... is this one-sixty-two right now, no three-ten uh,  yeah you're, you're not in our section yeah yeah. i forgot that this was here, i'm actually coming from G-S-I office hours but, that's okay   yeah, i'll just wait. what time is it? two  so the only one that is_ are we done with it? no  it's irreversible, right what about you tell me. um, oh you don't have a chair. oops, i'm sorry. how come looks like no looks like no, yeah  it's not reversible  can i ask you a question? sure wh- why do you need oxaloacetate to be reversible? do you know why? why do you need it  w- it's just a ob- uh another way to regulate it. i mean if  it might be, used very quickly. so that's why it's in low concentrations. oh okay. cuz it prefers to be in low concentrations  oh cu- isn't that like a higher energy? that's why? oh. if it is  oh i don't know i don't know either. where did you read that? i don't know it's the different book okay God don't stress. okay. is this it? is this the one? that's your, uh yeah little study guide thing mkay well okay. so where do we make A-T-P here? umm, at the nonreversible points. not always. but you can't go backwards to m- you can't use A-T-P to go backwards to A-D-P  cuz it's not_ i don't know you can.   that's reversible. but you're producing A-T-P right oh okay... is that the only step where you, get A-T-P? no uh, isn't there two A-T-Ps from this? why do you say there're two A-T-Ps? i must be confusing it with something else you're not confusing it with anything else. what about the very end reaction,  well like i- once you complete it   oh you don't? uh you get N-A-D-H and F-A-D-H-two but, oh  it's cuz you go around twice  you have two acetyl CoAs to start off with? yeah  oh yeah okay.  oh okay okay i printed that off the web so, everyone can get that  and she said she was gonna update it. oh i think she updated it today right? cuz, i don't know (she said something about it) yeah, i didn't understand this part, the pentose phosphate pathway?   she, i think_ well it was on that ho- remember that homework? is that on there? cuz, it was on that homework assignment we had remember the photosynthesis   oh oh okay can i ask you a    yeah mhm mm okay  i don't really know  i think these are just like different like designations but like, it represents like, this could be the same as that    A i- it's just a multistep pathway oh so just like  so they could no, the enzyme is the ac- the arrow, okay the enzyme is here this is a product, that you get. oh, okay     right right there's very little substrate, but you have lots of enzyme around, okay? so you still have to make one you would still, make a comparable amount of product, oh okay oh okay  so here's your substrate,  so you have     right there's m- right reaction arrows? like you know th- like you know in the citric acid cycle  okay not good pizza? i said it looks good oh. okay i thought you said it looks sick,  oh okay this is clear now. okay? okay. what else? uh, which ones are exothermic? the ones that are irreversible? or no. you tell me, which ones are exothermic. well, obviously this one has to be right? cuz it's the first one is, highly exothermic, right? is it exothermic or exergonic? aren't they the same thing? what's the difference? i thought they were the same thing. ex- exergonic means exothermic. yeah   if it's negative, it's exergonic, right  does it have to be? what's the equation for delta G? delta G equals isn't i- something minus, change of T, del-   so oh entr- entropy  yeah so  S S? isn't there T and then   let's look it up. H minus T ti-      what's just synonyms? exothermic and usually, they are, but,  okay in this case yes oh okay,   gives off h- y- yeah ender- what is the other one? endergonic right.  hm what takes in ener- no- exo- exothermic takes in heat, and  e- exergonic gives off  endothermic,  endergonic and exergon- which,   you uh, you can know a lot about the whole passage by just looking at the picture right just right. you know uh uh uh if you don't have time to read, just go in and look at the figures, like before the exam. i highly recommend that. even if you do read everything, and you just want like, quick study session  okay isn't it, here. yeah (oh,) here it is. oh this doesn't have the delta G cycle does it? where do we have delta Gs? oh, they're here. for, creation of A-T-P you need a delta G of negative thirty, point-five or something? right.   um, it can be if it's coupled with something else. usually alone it's not. yeah, okay, what? actually okay right okay oh exothermic's for H but, w- delta G's exergonic (and)   what does H stand for? what does H stand for? change of enthalpy enthalpy, oh okay that's heat. and then, endergon- a- oh and delta G is f- oh, alright yeah. okay   what? if it favors products or not, you mean, forward_ uh oh, instantaneous? instantaneous or spontaneous? spontaneous, okay spontaneous those are two, very different terms. okay  forward yeah mkay sure mkay okay   right yeah,  okay, and endothermic and exothermic, just heat but if something's, exothermic then it's gonna be, spontaneous. not necessarily. what's the equation for G? what's the equation for G? uh, change of H T yeah T delta S just put H minus T, times delta S. right. so, what's T? what's  temperature? right and what's S? en-  right,  entropy entropy    yeah that's, it's another equation oh d- do we have to know that? you don't have to know that no yeah but, if are there calculations on the second exam, that you gotta make?    what's that? chapter fourteen oh yeah, it's pr- yeah     right, you can. so you can have, an endothermic reaction, that is exergonic. okay.  okay okay okay? so back to this. back to that. tha- this one, doesn't this one have a change, a big change in G? right, ne- uh it's like negative thirty-two-point-two    right, that's four. okay. what about here? um, okay. so, okay (and) here to here fou- uh, no wait that's not actually three. because um, the through the_ it's actually four, yeah. to get to the intermediate it's three, the intermediate of sysaconitate. okay they will, yeah but then   isocitrate to uh, alpha gluto keto gluterate wait, i'm confused. no, i was wrong this is three? that's  the next one's four. okay, here to here. the next one's four. and this definitely has to be four is it highly four? yeah if it's highly four, how can it be reversible? oh, but i thought that's where you get, your A-T-P. that is where you get your A-T-P. so isn't it from like a, a transition reaction or something? is it in here? so if you're gaining A-T-P, i would_ i mean_  mhm  highly forward so, this is not okay but it's it's low, like it's not very high. it's not very high, what? it's not highly, endergonic it's not highly exergonic  yeah so it'd be like lowly? lowly, exergonic? uh well it's like negative three, okay, pretty normal  three? zero. oh it's nothing? it's neither exergonic nor endergonic. can it do that though? because then the reaction wouldn't occur. cuz there's no energy putting putting,  oh it oh okay  what do you think? yeah, i would say. no no? oh that'd be, wait, wha- what, why am i on the wrong what about in the fumarate to malate? oh, that is, it's, lowly exergonic. okay what's that little O mean? that you just drew? this? yeah neither. oh it's zero kilojoules per mole. okay yeah  what is that? i would guess it's probably it's three exerg- three? so it'd be, okay so it takes in energy to go to_ oh okay cuz you have to make it, like that's why this one's so, highly exergonic. to pull that one oh okay   yeah. why was it again? because the reaction to make it, from malate, uh is so, endergonic... and the reaction to make citrate, from oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA is so exergonic, okay can we do this one next?  Lucky do you know if G-S-I office hours are always in alcove 5, or    oh really? well yeah usually she's in that one though usually but, like s- she, it was there last week   oxaloace- so from oxaloacetate to acetyl CoA is zero? from oxaloacetate to acetyl CoA? yeah those are two substrates for the same enzyme, for a citrate synthase. oh they combine they combine   how you're doin-  okay, good. were you mad at me last week?  how would it be fun? okay other than you yelling at me. well i mean if i ask a question and y- and i mean it's a really easy one and you just haven't, prepared at all, that's      oh, really? do you have to go? yeah, what i i don't know i i  oh you do? yeah okay, well if you think of anything else, you can always come to that one, and i think there's another one tomorrow from four to six. four to six? by who? um, ew. what? no, if i need_ i come every Monday haven't i? yeah n- it's j- okay i don't know who it is, uh i forgot his name uh actually i probably  i just figured you really? really wow can i just ask you about this picture first? yeah,      but if this is not in humans, oh this is just plants yeah, we're  right in the glyoxosome oh okay and that's where you get the glyoxylate cycle  oh i'm sorry you didn't know about the recording thing  and then, this is     cuz that's what the book called it. okay, can w- i see that term? um it was, in yeah i'm kinda shady on that like, not very clear on   okay, well this is actually the oxidation of fatty acids. this is not  yeah. so this is not it. this is amino acid oxidation.  uh i don't think you actually  oh they have different pictures. oh here, this one. okay. so where does it say Q cycle? oh, in our book it was like later in the_ was it, when they talk about, complex three, how ca- i don't know ma- maybe it's a new term they have. yeah no they do call it the Q, something or other. okay you're in photosynthesis now. okay, so so it was it was like somewhere here or s- like, like y- i think you make two cytochrome Cs, like, t- y- two cytochrome Cs are used to, make it go more. okay what yeah shouldn't we eat this before it gets cold? you can have a slice, if you want it. that's okay. what, go, eat. no i'll get all greasy. okay.   oh  yeah i, actually i don't even    oh is it in plants only? i thought it was in everything. where's the plant picture one though? just, keep going are those like, those big, like iron things (oh)  oh okay. oh it's in plants? i thought it was in... Q cycle, right there. Q cycle, oh it's in plants   uh no that's eighteen-nine. figure eighteen-ten. so yeah you have, it's, okay, Q B H cytochrome B okay. so yeah, what happens is,   but if it's only in plants n- no oh  okay oh okay    are these, these are the ones with um, iron in it right? these are iron container things?  weren't they like something like, irons in the middle of it? like, they're two di- the cytochromes are all different, A B and C? (xx) yeah this book isn't,  oh okay cuz like i was just looking at it is this it? this thing? no it was like a bi- like a big page full of, all the  oh. is it important to know? like, like some, some of them have, c- like cytochrome C i think is covalently bonded, n- but the other two aren't, the covalently bonded to what? plac- like, histidine or something or cystine? okay b-   that's what i was talking about then. like our book had pictures of some of these. okay, yup, does she say that  no, she doesn't, it's like it this book doesn't exist like we only have our b- well, i don't think anyone has this book no one has that book? well then she might want you to know that stuff. oh okay. well i'll just look on the, review, sheet, later. oh, okay well let's see, if you have to know it. this looks like it's uh, yeah (xx) that's when like hydrogen pumps out   that's just th- that's just the general picture of it, right    how many? thirty to thirty-two? per what? per, one glucose. no. two? no... okay i'm hungry. okay, so let's eat then. can i eat? yeah okay, are you guys ready? whoa it's, triangle... we don't have napkins  um, she said that, whoa are you vegetarian? no. oh what is feta cheese?   goat's. it's the, stuff right here. where does it come from you mean? yeah. Greece. um, i don't know, Greece? okay. yeah, it's a Greek cheese. it's either made by sheep, or goats. okay, i need a napkin. i'm a messy eater. use a piece of paper. okay. can i use this? no  there's one on the floor. no, she wants that. crap. here... here, there's a  there's a newspaper oh, here's a newsp- oh whoops there're no bugs. yeah there are. there're so many bugs in the S-L-C it's ridiculous. s- all these chemicals  oh you're welcome. good... thank you for being recorded. no problem. we'll do anything for free food, right? so we don't have to know those little things i was talking about. i don't think so... i didn't have to know it. okay so like two cycles in complex three yes... oh, okay  is what independent? ubiquinol independent of what? of complex, three. if i was like its own, entity. um, yeah maybe. like cytochrome C is independent, right? mhm so how do you, how does it, pump the protons? doesn't it lower the, gradient or something? so it, allows it... it goes four four two right? yeah no... complex three? only two go out complex one no, four. four? oops, i just,   yeah, aren't there two Hs that go? no they're four four two. okay, whatever you guys think... where do the other four go out? um, i have to go to work but, okay did she help you? yeah that's good. did you do the homework yet for this week? no. oh, okay i'm gonna be up all Tuesday night if you wanna call me bye. bye. um no they were like real big pictures though they oh so it comes out, complex three. yeah. it goes in one and is carried by, that Q-H-two that's, ubiquinol, and it goes to three, and then goes to the Q cycle. mkay, where does the other four get pumped out of? complex two. complex  it has to go out three  mhm okay  is that the answer to this one? like what's_ is this where he's talking about N-A-D-Hs? yeah, let's just answer the questions yeah, right? right,  so what happened? oh, she's about to tell us. so complex one, is N-A-D-H,  go through that. yes. they come in and they drop off the electrons they've been carrying, and are converted back to N-A-D-plus. and those electrons are taken by, complex one or, N- N-A-D-H dehydor- dehydrogenase complex isn't it i- i- for every one N-A-D-H two, go out and then uh, so you have two N-A-D-Hs going that's why you have four?   is it? yeah so, how does it enter it? isn't  yes it doesn't take the N-A-D-H, it takes the two electrons that the N-A-D-H have carried. but mhm how come why is there only one H though? how does it have two? okay, draw up on the board it's  yeah, s- bu- oh the other, plus H just follows it? watch. whoa, careful.  okay hm so it'd be so you take, one of those pluses away so (then you) is you add two minuses, so one plus, so it becomes a negative? two minus, oh okay so it becom- if it's negative the H is there it's  so it's zero. oh one plus, wait that's zero. that is zero_ yeah, that's zero, that's right oh  it's just a proton. it's H_ doesn't, how many electrons is it, none? it doesn't have any electrons,  tha- it's really, this. oh okay yeah  but it's not really that but didn't they say the plus isn't really a charge? it's not like isn't  they they talked about like the p- like the plus isn't really what it means it's the plus isn't  it means, this is what it is. you have an N, it's bound to four things. yeah  okay oh ok-  okay yeah, i know okay, so that's how y- that's  right okay and then F-A-D-H is exactly the same as N-A-D-H for this complex two, that's why you get four, also. what's different about, s- f- F-A-D-H is fla- f-  what do i, how do i make F-A-D-H-two? remember it was F-A-D-H-two. how do i make it? what do i start with? F-A-D-plus? plus two E, two H so in this case, you, F-A-D can accept both, the two electrons and the two hydronium ions. so it gets a neutral ch- it shouldn't be neutral then should it? no. shouldn't they be charged cuz they can move inside the cell? like, you know the cytosol or whatever? oh, well i guess, wait, it has to be like that but then, it can't be, two... oh yeah, yeah it does yeah, okay. then, it works... oh it always accepts one. it'll only accept one of these hydronium ions, the two electrons, and the other hydronium ion is, just, he's he's he's with him, he's, oh okay oh okay that's why they're there.  right,  oh okay it says like there're two shuttles, what are the shuttles? this? two shovels?  shuttles,  what's a  yeah,    that's a shuttle. uh is that a shuttle?   that's a shuttle, right? yes yeah. how come that's not a shuttle? it takes it. because it's putting it in, it's   oh, okay     yeah there is two, what's  tha- no, we're talking about N-A-D-H having two shuttles. oh  isn't it one and three? no. four? one and four? okay, does N-A-D-H come, to three? three gets its energy for pumping the electrons, o- for pumping the protons, from the electrons that, these guys have passed along. mhm   so, she said the two shuttles for a- for for N-A-D-H. there's another shuttle for N-A-D-H. but that's not listed there it's not on that picture. where is it? isn't it, i don't know. is it like, isn't it like the, ubiquinone, that shuttles the where else do you get, N-A-D-H? you get it from the  in the N-A-D-H yeah yes and where does glycolysis take place? in the mitochondria?   it's like,  right where what's outside the mitochondria? the   cytosol. so, there has to be some kind of shuttle  okay  this one. does that look like the right picture? isn't there like, i- that (simport) and antiport some- something like that? A-T-P,  what? sorry i had to laugh. you're laughing with me? yeah. wet ones.  maybe there is another picture, hm.  so what i said was wrong?   the one you were laughing at the, N-A-D-H with the, thing going (in) i wasn't laughing at you... i was laughing at something else, like i think of things and i laugh. okay... okay, so what is it?   can't it move cuz it's charged already? so, oh no  what's that? what's that? F-A-D, complex three... cytosolic cyto-   that's not a shuttle. that's an enzyme. how is that not a shuttle? it's not a complex.  no,  oh you're changing G  mhm so that's the shuttle? the malate aspartate shuttle right, read that section   'm'm should i start studying for the exam today? yeah. i don't know. it's all highlighted for you. read the two highlighted portions. there's one sentence.  so that's three shuttles then. where are there three shuttles? read the two highlighted sections. read the second highlighted section. okay it says shuttle, this says shuttle i thought complex    okay, i see that but i thought complex one was, also a shuttle. it is a shuttle. so that means there are three shuttles, not two. what are the three shuttles? the, malate aspartate shuttle mhm um is the malate aspartate shuttle another name for, complex one? is it? i'm assuming so. you tell me. oh yeah, it is.  yeah well that took you long enough i'm a slow eater. yeah   thing thing. this, is it's called a shuttle, i guess it yeah i guess it is another shuttle. um, yeah those are two shuttles, yeah. so the only two complex shuttles are G-three-P and complex one. right. oh okay. those are the  i_ she also wants to know, about this one. so she's asking fo- she's actually asking for_ when she says shuttles she means these two shuttles. this one is also, oh okay so complex, if it was like, on your exam, what are the two shuttles A B C, and D?  you would say those two. okay not complex one? well  really okay um, yeah okay, i guess you could say that. well i don't    okay okay?    well, this is a way of getting N-A-D-H from one point to another from one point to another. and it's shuttled because it, um, it is transferred, the electrons from it are transferred, to something else, yeah. yeah. and then, that thing can move across the membrane and then make N-A-D-H again on the other side of the membrane, and then um, and then interact with complex one. okay (yeah i- i-) yeah, what i- what is an isosyme? isn't it something that can catalyze two different things? is that what's what's an isosyme? what's an enzyme? a catalyst. so what's an isosyme? it can do two it can do,     but it's different  oh so like an amino acid could have a different residue, but it could still do the same thing. an amino acid could have  okay right, that's an isosyme oh okay. but you could also call those mutants because, you changed one amino acid. but if they exist in two different forms in, the body, oh  oh okay oh okay. okay i understand that now. okay, could we do, steps responsible for generating, the hydrogen ion gradient. okay. what_ how do you do that? just do it on the board.   i don't know it, though. but you can help me (probably) how do you, how are you pumping    one, one three and four. right yeah  so it's basically, okay N-A-D, goes N-A-D-plus, and from this, four, come out? yeah, and then that makes yes. then   because, from glycolysis. mm, let's look at that little chart they have for you.  so there's two, in the matrix, mhm okay, so that's all you they want you know when they mean the, the g- ion gradient is just that read_ like, those steps? like this thing right here right? right. doesn't the H then sort of go through doesn't it leak out here,    well how no oh no ten, ten yeah so it'd be, ten but, that would make it nine. cuz you get four pumped out four pumped out, two gets pumped out, and then, it looks like one gets pumped back  no okay well, falling down its gradient but it comes back into the matrix    okay so you pump those, w- however many across. okay if i give you ten dollars and somehow i get one dollar back, i have nine dollars. but you also got an A-T-P out of it. okay okay these take more    i don't think it really matters, where it comes out  i mean it just, falls down its gradient. it it could, i i don't know, where, it i mean they it's n- a- tha- cuz this is the thing that rotates,   oh there's still there's still some iffy, it's hypothesized, oh okay i'm like sketchy on these steps ri- like this, okay right here, okay four, gets pumped out, then, the electrons, what does, complex two do here?  dehydrog- like it, so yeah  um, what do you get? phosphorylater? no    what do you get from that step? here  F?   F-A-D-H-two. oh. these ones? oh,  yeah complex two is, that enzyme,  but they just separated it. they separated it, right. oh okay  oh okay i under-  right, oh okay so all these other ones are just like somewhere else? i mean i mean   they're floating? they're floating yeah  they can hang out, in the  oh okay  right. right, okay? okay, i didn't know that. yeah they don't explain that in the book at all, i think. and that's really bad. oh     yeah oh, so this is complex three. yes, you can write complex three up there. okay the enzyme? yeah. succinate dehydrogenase? i actually  is that it? complex three is something else. well we're, talking about complex two.   is it? yeah it's, cuz it's...  you did all of that? yeah. very good.    okay. in the study guide,   okay i would do that definitely   oh s- okay. oh okay really? stuff like, what you know,  um, there's a multiple choice stuff and all that right. and then there's one thing after the multiple choice that's like, it's like, you know apply the knowledge or something like that, oh okay yeah that's   yeah, yeah, exactly it's like way specific and you have to like hunt for everything in the book   exactly i mean if it actually helps you learn it, oh it di-  yeah it will sorta make you hate, biochemistry. oh okay oh okay that's  don't you? okay i do. i hate this class. wha- oh, okay. i like organic chemistry better than this. okay what else?   tran- uh electrons that are transferred, along the respiratory chain yeah that's the picture. yeah tha- that's it     yeah   didn't they do that, that,  is it like, i think it was kind of in our notes but, yeah  yeah. can you go backwards? can i go from A-T-P, no no. no? aren't you going from like a really high energy to a low energy? so if i_ this i- you're saying that this enzyme, won't go backwards. it won't go from A-T-P to A-D-P plus a pho-  oh no i guess it can. it ca- it will. cuz yeah in the right  okay  so, in your book i- has, did they say that the structure of this is totally solved? no, they just showed us all these like, protein structures. did they say the structure of this guy's totally solved? um,   all i know is they just showed us a lot of like,    okay.  that was random. i know i just thought of it  okay, will A-D-P and the inorganic phosphate, w- make A-T-P, uh, without the hydrogen pump? or without this, falling down its gradient? no no no. needs it. cuz there's no, nothing to move it, make it move in a circle.  oh oh okay, so that's why you need the hydrogens. the hydrogens fall down their gradient forcing, this F-one complex    it's the world's smallest machine. that's what, my s- teacher calls it. okay. okay oh okay oh yeah do you think the cell map is good to study like, we should make the cell map     have we got, to uh carbohydrate ma- metabolism yet? have you? i don't know,  what ab- what about uh, glucagon and, (all of that?)  glucogenesis? isn't that what they ca-  yeah yeah. have you done that yet? i don't think you've  oh okay. i don't think you've discussed  i no, i fell asleep in class though.  do you guys look at the notes that are on the web? i printed them out but i  i look at that and i look at her uh, slides, yeah okay, so did you guys discuss gluconeogenesis yet? no no okay what is, okay, what about the, cyclic and noncyclic, foio- phosphorylation where are we? what's,  i don't know. rubisco? i don't know     okay.  are we done? oh we have ten more minutes. practically. okay, mkay. okay what about this stuff? bioenergenics, glycolysis, i think we've, gone over glycolysis like, bioenergenics? hmm what? glycolysis? the stats? yeah pretty much. you need to know. i pretty much know what happens. you can have this. so glycol- glucose to, six okay, we're talking about  i don't know all those equations and stuff. oh well doesn't she give you them? yeah but like i won't know how to use them. you won't know how to use them? no. i'll have to look over 'em.  right are there any other fates? no they're only three. no there're th- what about all those anaplerotic reactions? yeah but, they tell you that like the th- it says the three fates of pyruvate. oh does it? oh. yeah, those are yeah... isn't that what we did last time kind of? did we do that last time? okay if you have high g- if you have like a high glucose level then insulin will b- will release, but then if you don't then, glucagon will be released  the A-T-P concentration is high? A-T-P over A-D-P? so what is the active, form of that (xx) phosph- the A form, is the active form. yeah cu- phosphorylase B is   right  so what's in the paper today? i don't know. are you voting tomorrow? no. why not? i'm not registered. that's sad. i'd have to go home anyways. what does that mean? you'd have to go home anyways cuz if i why can't you register here? oh,  you only stay registered for a year. oh, you have to reregister every time? i'm pretty sure. no? no i don't remember. i don't know, i'm not even from, Michigan and i registered here.  good for me? no, good for the country guys. i don't know. are you even from Michigan? no. where are you from? Virginia. see my vote wouldn't count in Virginia but it counts in Michigan. so why didn't you just go to, University of Virginia? uh because, i knew too many people that went there. it's a better school than this. no it's not. yeah it is. no it's not yes it is no it's not. in the overall ranking it ranks higher. i- it's it's not better. it's not better. okay whatever. but that's okay.  but it's better. but anyways. it ranked higher. maybe it ranked higher this year but it didn't rank higher when i, accepted my, little, okay no we're done. it's four o'clock. we have, four more minutes. you're always complaining that we don't go over enough stuff. well i don't think i've learned anything in the last, three minutes  i don't think so oh, yeah well can we_ yeah, we have. like this is, the stuff right? okay so i'm gonna ask a question real quick okay?   hey, how's it going? um, oh, that wasn't good. um nope oh. answer the question. um, if it's what about reduction potential, what is that? i have no idea. okay. mm mm i thought everybody would be jealous of us. no one is, though. some people have been. oh really?  what's that? they would be jealous of our pizza. oh. she's doing biochem too. that's the G-S-I. that's not the G-S-I. the one that's talking right now? mhm oh it sounded like somebody i knew. sorry. 	1
LAB205SU045.json	so everybody, everybody got a handout? (xx) no. you didn't get one? okay, so today we'll be talking about, uh flows and plant lines. and vent losses and exit losses and entrance losses and valve losses and this and that, and, it's going to be an individual assignment, so you'll have to do it, all by yourselves of course you are allowed to discuss with partners how to do it, but i would like to see your own work, i'd like to see, uh, your own set-up, and your own solution and your own discussions. and um, couple other things as well, that i would like to see in the assignments that you hand in. and let me just quickly, tell you what those are going to be. you'd say that we should set up a, Excel sheet, for all of these problems, or? no no just for one of 'em. i mean i'm suggesting that you do that you can do it in multiple ways but what i would suggest is, set up an Excel sheet, cuz for instance if you look at the first problem which we'll be doing, the the way it usually do i let you read the quest- question and you ask me a question about the question. so i would like you to, well i would suggest that you set up a, some sort of a Excel workbook for this. okay you have this, Fs you have your Ds you have your discharge you have this and that, and once you have that set up you can just goal-seek for the variable that you're looking for, and then for the rest of the problems you just have this spreadsheet, everything is set up the Fs is set up the Qs the, head loss coefficients, formulas everything is set up, you just change numbers, in individual cells and you modify a little bit and do another goal-seek... makes sense doesn't it? yes? mhm and that's what i would suggest but if you don't wanna go through that you can just use your calculator and, go about doing it this way too. so. now, a couple things, once you do your assignment for each problem set, for each single one of 'em, those are the things i'd like to see.   nothing.   visc_ you got it. Ann you are right on the dot. exactly. you'll need to do_ well you may want to do your sample calculations right? so that's what you'll need this for. okay so, why don't we do it the way we usually do it then i would like you to read the questions, let's start with question number one, read it through, and um, ask me questions. and we'll talk about it. okay? so just question number one. what's the difference between the hydraulic and the energy grade lengths? good question. anybody having, an answer? i don't, i could look and see if i can find one. (xx) okay isn't um, the_ well the, the hydraulic energy line is just the water level, but i don't understand what that, means here. the, hydraulic  in_ like in an open channel isn't that what it would be? but it's not right okay, well, how do you calculate, the hydraulic grade line in an open channel? what's the formula for that? like what's_ how do you calculate the water depth...? it's P over gamma isn't it? you want me to write all this down for you. B-one-squared B B-one (xx) B-squared through G plus Z plus P over gamma right? the total energy equation isn't this that you want a, minus E-two over um... well yeah right but that's the energy slope. energy one minus energy two divided by the length, through which this energy drop took place that's the energy slope right? the hydraulic grade line is s- say you just take individ- like you'd figure out what values of uh E, and then, a hydraulic grade line are (at) like various points on the X-axis  so when it says it's twenty meters, uhuh oh that's the length of the pipe. so would you need to plot it like that or_ do you see what i'm saying? you'd plot it... you don't take into account the angle that it's at, right? well, do you need to though? like suppose you have this reservoir here, right? and is the pipe is sticking out of here and it's going this way right, and i- it's going into another pipe and here is some expansion going on and some all kinds of stuff and you know how to deal with that by the way, right? okay, so here, at this point, you need to determine what the energy is at this point, right? and you know what the energy drop is going to be across this length of the pipe because you have everything given to you. the pipe diameter the length you have everything given so you can easily determine what the head loss is going to be through here, so you can come to this point and say okay, this energy, minus all the energies here, is going to be equal to the energy here whatever that may be. and you just, connect the two lines. oh, that's it? yeah. oh. head loss? is there head loss in the pipe? well that's the friction loss right? water's going through the pipe, it's getting exposed to friction, and that causes the head to drop. right? what else is there? what else is there, that causes the head in the pipe to drop...? is it the entrance and the exits? exactly. very good. this thing is in the reservoir, it's entering the pipe, and of course you can (see) different types of entrance losses exit losses, you need to take that into account, right? well if this is the case, then probably a better way to represent this energy grade line would be, i need to know what the energy here is, it undergoes some drop, and you'll determine what the magnitude of that is because of the entrance, and then you have another point, because of friction, (djoo, you're gonna be right here) but we don't_ you don't really ex- want us to figure out what distance that's over.  where the entrance loss is. this distance here? yeah. oh no no no.    okay. now let me ask you a question right here then. what is the energy of the flow right here? total energy. where did you point again? right, inside the reservoir before the flow even enters the pipe. it's not (what) a Z is it? huh? whatever the Z on this well how about the P-over-gamma and the V-square over two-G? that we emphasized. da-dum, that's it. everybody see that...?  at the surface right. right here because right here you need to have some sort of energy. well okay, if the energy right there is equal to the Z whatever that may be, so what do you think Bradley what is the hydraulic grade line over there? same thing. same thing. right? you all see that... okay, you got that important concept. so now, at this point the energy and the hydraulic grade lines coincide and after that it won't of, of course because the velocity changes and this and that, but you already calculated that right...? right...? okay. so any other questions then? so when we plot it do you want u- us to plot it like, on this drawing, or do we just do it on a regular Excel? oh you don't have to do an Excel drawing you can just oh okay. y- you said we had a Q, but how do we get Q out of this? good question. how do you get a Q out of this, this thing...? how would you set up your sets of equations so that you get a Q out of this? you just use your H-L equals R-Q-squared. you got the question, you gave the answer. right. you know what Z-one is, you know what Z-two is, at the very end of the system, well those two_ the difference between Z-one and Z-two, will have to be taken up by all the losses that this flow encounters while it's going down right? and the losses it encounters is friction losses in pipe one pipe two, expansion loss, entrance loss, exit loss, i guess there's a valve in there too right? and valve loss. and you know how to represent each one of 'em, right? so you have an equation saying, delta, Z, the head difference between the two reservoirs, will have to be, equal, to, all the losses that the syst- that the flow encounters as it goes down from, reservoir one to reservoir two right? there can't be anything else... right? does it make sense to everybody? so there's no velocity at the end? uh, meaning what at the end? like this thing is_ goes like this  right? it's still inside the pipe. but as soon as this thing exits the pipe and enters the reservoir all the velocity that it had, poof, it's gone. that's why we have an exit loss, right? and that's what you need to take into account right here, okay...? right...? any other questions? so, to go about finding the location you would look at the energy grade line and subtract off, like V-squared,  i mean of_ location of maximum pressure. ah, okay. so do we do the maximum on the energy grade line minus, like velocity minus elevation? correct. well, maximum of what? maximum of the energy right? is that what you're s- well yeah, if you do a thought experiment, since you asked this question that's mine. okay here we go. but then you'd need the velocity at every, every point right?  as small as possible as small as possible. so this doesn't necessarily mean that... where is this small, in the system? at the end of the run, anywhere where the, well zero. right anywhere where this, where this isn't it_ but didn't you already answer that, because we know at the end it's zero? at the very end it's_ well inside the reservoir it's zero right. but inside the reservoir you know what the maximum pressure is. right. right? so is there another place that the pressure is even higher than this? before the expan- the exit expansion. is that what you mean? right here you mean? no i'm just, that's what you're saying, okay. the energy here and the energy here are different, mhm well, where are we_ how are we figuring that out to begin with to solve the energy equation? P-over-gamma. you know, what the energy is going to be, right? you know what the energy is going to be here, here, um, and then if this is the valve right before the valve right after the valve and right before the, entrance into th- into the reservoir and at the reservoir you know that the_ what the energy values are there. but i thought we knew what those were  okay let's back up here. okay alright, now, forget about the energy... well, with the head loss equations.  P of the entrance times Q-squared over two-G  minus R-Q-squared. R-Q-squared and R is F times L over D ti- well that's it right? F times L over D over, two-G whatever. yeah yes. yes. yes. okay, let me ask you a question. well before i ask you this question though, for this problem for this particular problem, in addition to what we just talked about that i would like to see, i also would like to see these here. i would like you to tell me what your delta-H is that you used for your calculations, delta-H meaning the energy difference between those two reservoirs, what energy difference did she use? i'd like to see that. i would like you to tell me what V-C-one-squared two (xx) V-two-squared over two-G-R. trivial once you have Q, and you know the diameter, of the two pipes just ratio them and give me this value... so i would like to see numerical values for these, obviously we need to see Q that's what you're asked anyways. now, i also would like to see, when you do your P calculations i don't really care if you do it in terms of P over gamma, or if you change it to P like, this_ the value that you calculate multiply it by gamma or not i don't really_ it doesn't matter to me. just gimme a P value, maximum P value... okay? i want to see those. in nice little circles or boxes right. okay, now before we move on, i would like to ask you one more question just to see that you are, um, on the same wavelength here. well it says a new commercial steel pipe. why would i bother giving you this? have they ever talked about a, pipe a steel pipe in here? you have to estimate, the friction losses. exactly... (what did he say?) huh?   so you want the discharge in each pipe section? very good question, yeah, like cuz the system has like three sections right? so you have three discharges which one do i wanna see? well i would like to see all of course, so how about figuring out initial Q, again. huh? how about figuring out well you need to_ all is based on this_ this energy equation that we just talked about right? this delta-H difference it's cu- because that is equal to, whatever head losses the flow encounters right? well... let's_ how would you write an energy difference equation for this? cuz we don't (have) two reservoirs anymore but one of the, ends is open to the atmosphere, so how would you write your energy equation...? what is E E-one? call this section one, let me just do it on the board... well your Z is, one thousand. so E is, one thousand? yes well how about_ so we know that E-one minus E-two is equal to the sum of all the head losses that this thing encounters as it moves down, in the pipe. well we just determined that E-one is equal to a thousand feet, well... what is E-two, do you think? nine-twenty, nine-twenty, nine-twenty, plus your... P over gamma term. very good P over gamma and? plus your V-squared G term. well, since you told me this statement let me ask you a question. what is this? it's zero isn't it? why?   (that's) the answer. cuz it's open to the atmosphere. it's open to the atmosphere. zero. and the velocity is, what is the velocity? it's Q over A exactly. what A, what A? w- well the A of the pipe right? right  no. okay. and this is equal to, all the head losses that the system encounters. right? now, H-F-one plus H-F-two say it again. the H-F-one plus H-F-two. H-one plus H-F-two plus four. oh okay that's, it. it didn't even see this pipe, right? but the particle could have also instead of choosing this path, chosen the other path, and then the energy loss we can use two sections without doing this, minus one minus three minus four it doesn't even know what's going (down) its tube, right? so this is wrong you guys, i don't wanna see this in the assignments really. could you just take an average, of the two? whoo they're the same.   they are the same exactly. it just seems like we're gonna have too many unknowns. uh like what? you know the Fs right. i mean you know you can estimate what the Fs are right? cuz you have this thing called a Holland equation that says one over squared of F is equal to minus zero times seventy-nine times L and times, well i don't remember the rest, but that's (basically) what it is. so you plug in the numbers you plug in the length you plug in the type of the pipe you have, and this and that and you have an estimation for F. yes? so, when we solve, that equation that, E-one minus E-two equals H-F-one H-F-two plus H-F-four, uhuh very good question. (wouldn't) that be a- the Q of the two? well, in that equation you'll have,  gr- good question. well what i would suggest, since we haven't even talked about how to deal with losses in branching pipes, negligible. and leaving the reservoir? uh, leaving, this one here for ex-? yeah exactly i would like it if you include the loss here because we know that there is a reservoir, but here, well, there's nothing really right? and besides, this thing here, (xx) for counting these in the equation (you have of) that too. okay. right? so, yeah. what do you mean by construct a figure? like, i don't, i don't think i exactly understand that term. okay, oh the last sentence you  okay construct a figure it's basically plot Q versus, uh valve opening. like you have this plot here, it has valve opening in terms of percentages, in terms of C-D. what i would like you to do is replace this C-D with a Q, basically. i don't get that part where the um, it says, mhm mhm, okay, um, how is it? how is that? alright, well, let's see. all set. you are the man. what would that K-L be plugged into? say it again. that K-L we found i got plugged back into, up top there. right. the K-L goes in here because here you have, Q unknown and K-L unknown, but this K-L, is known now, for this particular valve setting so in this whole equation the only unknown, is Q, right? pull it out... and, write it down here. for this valve opening, this is the Q i get. and repeat it for a couple more of these values so that's why i keep on suggesting, if you have a s- s- spreadsheet or some sort of a programming tool available for you, you can just plug in these numbers and just, press goal seek goal seek goal seek all the time and you'll end up (with) all the right answers. why do you need to use goal seek (xx) when we do it?  but for all of these, problems, uhuh there's Fs so we need to estimate our initial Fs, go through this whole, thing and then, do it again with the_ our new Fs or, how exactly does that work? that's certainly one way of doing it and that's why i have the star up there, but i'll talk about it once we go through the assignment though, okay okay. doesn't a Venturi,  let's give  uh are we ready to, entertain any questions...? yes...? okay, so, any questions?   don't, don't understand i have a general,    okay. it says eight-inch diameter pipe uhuh uhuh right. just for convenience? yeah yeah.  okay. did i hear something about not understanding the entire question? yeah.  energy equation. the buzzword. well it's the energy equation but uh Darcy-Weisbach Darcy-Weisbach. good to know. okay now Darcy-Weisbach equation we use it in here, here we need to use some sort of an expression... that's a function of Q, and pull, the Q out of there. now, what's this? couldn't you just look it up?  there are some tables, i've_ yeah, but um, i i'm not sure if we have given you a table that, tells you what the loss is through a sharp-edged orifice... well let me, let me, direct you to a certain way of thinking. as i go down here, instead of having this, isn't this part, similar to having... a pipe like this...? right? yeah,   it's in your notes. but, i would like you to be, aware of something though in there, in this equation... um... what's, the one particular fundamental difference between, this, and this? can anybody see, from the sketch that i have on the board? flow contracts. flow contracts Jeffrey... if this is, four four if this is four inches... this one here, if i deal with expansion, this is not four inches. it's four inches times, the contraction. the flow doesn't expand from four inches outward. it goes from four inches into a contraction and then it starts expanding, right? does it make sense...? no, you said it's four times, the contraction? contraction coefficient. coefficient okay. right. are we supposed to just, guess, on that? i mean, by this point we, we sort of know but you sort of know exactly but, you also know that there's a table, uh, table sss- in one of the previous assignments in the back of the, assignment there was like a table, for contraction coefficients? and it's also in Alton's book in i think it's also in the other fluid mechanics book so y- you just pick, a contraction coefficient for that. and the contraction coeff- contraction coefficient is a function of the relative, ratio of the two, diameters right? right? so you use that equation but you nee- you need to make sure that you modify that, D-one, in there, by multiplying with the contraction index lower.  fifteen. yeah. (there's) the average (thing.) okay, zero-point-fifteen, of course not fifteen. but yeah, so you take that, and you plug this value, which is a function solely of Q, into your, energy equations. pull the Q out of there. but this K now is very different, right? right. it's very different. sss i mean we went through, a lot of pain in a couple labs to find that.  we can just guess now? yeah. what value would you pick? mm let me hear. uh  let me see. one-point-oh-two. one-point-oh-two somebody says.  zero-point-six. zero-point-six somebody else says.   what else? yeah. no? yes. yeah. and this is where we pick up our K values right because i did the calculation for this can everybody see this by the way? and i think you have, a copy of this in one of the assignment sheets. so this is the K... that goes in here. what page is that? that is on page, five-twenty-eight but as i said i think i, have given you a copy of this so, in one of the assignments you should have that... now, if you look at this graph, it's a function of Reynolds number, and, a diameter ratio, right? well diameter ratio fine good i know what the diameter is here the (xx) diameter i know what the pipe diameter is i can deal with that, okay, good how do you deal with a Reynolds number? there are all kinds of K values that you can pick from. the highest, seems to be... one-point-oh-two, who said that? Jeffrey? yeah. you man, good intuition. one-point-oh-two is the highest one and the lowest one goes to zero-point, um, sixty-three (xx) so, which one would you choose, to do your calculation? the average, the average. the_ do you have to calculate Reynolds number? huh? do you have to calculate Reynolds number? could you do that or not? you need to calculate Reynolds number but without the discharge can't you figure it out from the flow rate from the previous problem? but it's a different meter though. it's a different meter and it's a different head loss it's gonna result in a different flow rate. but this is a different meter it's gonna have a different   sorry. huh? go ahead. i was gonna say guess one guess one what, Q? guess like a K and then plug, plug that into your Q and then plug that Q into the Reynolds equation and see if it works. very good. how what, what K would you start off your calculations with? the average. the av- start off at the high end. at the high end. it's a high Reynolds number case. do your calculations, if the Reynolds number that you get, is greater than the high end, no matter how greater it is because after a certain point it is one, right? no matter how greater it is as long as it's greater, the K value that you assumed, is correct... i mean you can do it the way Brenda suggested too but then you would have to probably do multiple iterations because K Reynolds number probably will be moving off. but once you reach a high end, after that no matter how much bigger it is, that's the K value, no need for iteration. does this make sense...? to everybody? just ignore the, ignore the meter. that's it Bradley, ignore the meter cuz it's zero. so in this equation H-F plus H-meter, H-meter is zero. do your calculation again just, with H-F delta-E, is equal to H-F... and pull out a Q... okay...? yes...? yes, question? and delta-E is just this twenty feet, that's available right? exactly. exactly... any other questions on this before we move on...? yes? no? (xx) okay, number five, last question. which you talked about in class as well, imagine that. easy. easy. yeah. right...? okay before i let you all go, this F thing here... let me tell you something about this. well, there are, certain equations, that relate F to certain values certain characteristics of the pipe the length the diameter the, the this and that whatever, and um, so which one of those equations would you use, to solve this problem? give me an equation... uh you may wanna look at your notes. um, (xx) which one? are you talking about the one over, negative-zero-point-seven-eight-two? uh uh would you use that? i mean i'm asking you. do you feel comfortable with that? no but i was just giving it to you. do you use the one that's like the equivalent length, equation, that one? but that doesn't have an F in it. i mean, you still need to know what F is, even to use this equivalent thing. well since we're at high Reynolds numbers it seems we could use the one she was about to okay, how is it? what's the equation for that? one over um, quantity negative zero-point-seven-eight-two times the natural log of times the natural log of okay, that's it. that's it. that's it... this is the Holland equation isn't it? for high Reynolds number cases. so the regular equation has a plus, a number divided by Reynolds number in here, right? the whole equation don't you have it written down too? six-point-nine. six-point-nine... now, in order for you to do your initial estimate, what you say is i assume, a high Reynolds number case... if i assume a high Reynolds number case, now look at this, K-S is given to me, the diameter is given to me, well this is like a pretty, clean equation, you can easily pull an F out of there right? right? yep. so you use that, do your calculations, and at the end of the calculations, you have a small column, saying okay, i assumed a high Reynolds number case right? let me calculate the Reynolds number... V times D over kinematic viscosity. now if this Reynolds number is indeed greater, greater than ten to the mi- ten to the five or ten to the six, the one over it, it's gonna be like zero-point-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-one. and that's pretty small isn't it? so you don't even have to go back and put that in there because it's probably not gonna make that much of a difference. right? but i would like you to do that, because that is an assumption. you assume, high Reynolds number. once you are through with your calculations go back and calculate this for me. prove to me that this is the case indeed... okay...? alrighty, but af- after you find the F, in the back then find (F) after you estimate the F using this, you do your calculations, and you get a Q... and that Q is going to give you Reynolds number, right? well if that Reynolds number is bigger than ten-to-the-five or ten-to-the-six, i personally don't see any point in doing it here and modifying, F because, you're gonna have to take the one over ten-to-the-five (xx) (of that) ten-to-the-minus-five times six, th- that's for each problem then or? the verification? yeah. right. for any problem  huh? say again? any time you calculate a- a Q using an F then we need to do that. right. okay. right... alright. that's all folks. so i would like to have your assignments of course, before you leave and here are, yours. yes. well i have something else for you guys. aw come on. 	1
OFC285SG135.json	mkay... okay Jeff, why don't uh, try to start here by, bringing us up to date on, what you've been thinking about since our last, conversations. okay. um, we were talking about uh, you kn- you and i'd had a, a series of conversations about thinking about the different cultures that uh_ and particularly the bridging, or you know, looking for the right word or at least i'm still looking for the right word but but very interested in in the idea that you've suggested about, thinking about the work that the, i'm thinking now about the poetry mentors in particular, are doing with regard to, um, thinking about, in certain senses conveying aspects of the academic culture that they're very steeped in, to the students, that they're working with out, uh in the high schools. um, and we had a couple of_ we had a_ i wish you coulda been there um, we had a very very interesting conversation today, in in seminar, and uh it, touched on several issues that we've talked about. but in some intriguing ways so i wanted to, share a couple of those with you  yeah  yeah i was just gonna say yeah you you you're one ahead of me again. i you know i think there is and in fact and today there was a very direct sort of popular culture component. but, it's more than that, and you kn- and i mean i know you know  yeah well, lemme try this on you   mhm in a sense what's called i- uh audience and it's you know y- y- you know we're asking them, they know to take audience into consideration. but you're feeling that they're taking that audience in as a with a vengeance. it's they're taking it in with a vengeance. yeah mhm mhm mhm     mhm mhm yeah  yeah yeah mhm mhm mhm      yeah, a school in Spain uh American independent   yeah. okay. okay, alright, i don't know.  okay.   yeah.   right yeah? yeah yeah  no now wait a minute let's track this. yeah. right, she says this  yeah. yeah, (yeah)  and Mrs W says, um, jeez  oh, oh   uhuh mhm mhm mhm    well tha- yeah. exactly, exactly. and the other thi- well yeah. so th- i mean there's there's that concern yeah i mean th- those two th- cuz Erica's also looking at me and saying, she's sensitive enough to s- remember that Jeff also directs this project  yeah. this is enough t- you could easily predict, that this would be, uh well i've had it. if my, if these, young whippersnappers in Ann Arbor, you know the what's the line, sixteen square miles, surrounded by reality yup yup  right, because it becomes a matter of how much are we willing to, trust if that's the word i'll use that word. how much are we willing to trust, that Mrs W even though she may not speak to it directly, kinda got the message here? mhm.  yeah, yeah  yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're in cliche city baby.   yeah so do you know what, where where we where're they going with it? well, here's where here's where we decided is that um, one of the students, one of the quieter ones actually so i was really happy that that_ i wasn't necessarily expecting_ cuz i asked if anyone would be willing i said i'd be willing to do it, but i would i would i would be delighted if one of you were willing to send a message. you know cuz we now have the, private messaging,  mhm     yeah  no i don't think so. i don't think so. it was interesting. no it's_ it b- you're right, you're right. yeah so, Nicole's gonna go off and do this. Nicole's gonna go off and send a private message okay. now lemme interject if it is an interjection, maybe it's a a ver- what you're expecting. okay yeah    okay, i'm sorry.   yeah yeah. i see what you're saying yeah yeah, yeah yeah   okay yeah yeah  yeah yeah. (yeah) and then we gotta plop down this, formal academic, research scholarship mode, on something that we have enough trouble with, from any angle. how do we do that? how do we cast this..? what's your doc- what's your th- you know, what's your dissertation about, Jeff? um, you and i know, ever so precisely, and not at all yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, boy that's, nicely said. s- how have we thought about it in the past?  well, you mean things that  so things that, you mean things that i've kinda started on that, yeah, i'm i'm thinking back to their more recent, most recent conversations, uh where we  yeah yeah. right. we did.  yup, yup the yup, yeah, yeah, mhm mhm mhm yup  yeah, yeah... um, well, yeah i mean you raised that in, in one kind of, context and set of meanings, and, the other way we've talked about it has to do with thinking about, um, say when we talk about standards, the employment of standards in education. it's  mhm what we were referring to, uh based on Gary's experience there the ex-post-facto, um, analysis, of the fit between what had been learned, and the objectives, benchmarks, or standards. yeah yeah yeah. yeah. yeah. so that, um, you know well i'm i'm glad you brought that up because i, yeah well it i was kind of a, yeah it was unfortunately i'm glad you brought it up but it complicates it still more well, lemme try another thing cuz i if if_ i'm jumping around a lot but, maybe not. the other thing that we've talked about in this connection is trying to think about, um, how this setting, working with the mentors and their work with the students, how it might in some ways have_ what sort of, commonalities or what sort of relationship it might have with the work that, we're doing that i am newer at with with teacher education. mhm mhm mhm  i i i w- i i'm butting in. but, can you imagine, well isn't it a whole lot easier, in many respects, to teach the mentoring class abou- in the poetry guild, freed from the self-conscious, necessity to be doing teacher education? yeah yeah yeah. yeah.  form-  yeah  yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah yeah right yeah, lemme lemme tr- s- s- lemme say one_ give you, o- one of the other things i wanted to share with_ this is just a small one but to see if maybe it, maps back onto what you were saying in a way that makes sense cuz i'm seeing a connection, when you talk about, the formalizing process and what happens to that. um, and i maybe and i and i i didn't think when i when i used the word process but i i do wanna use that word, very mindfully. um, because in the course of the conversation as things flowed, people started talking about well... there're pieces in the coursepack and i mighta been able to talk to them on the first day about, sort of what the mission of I-P-G was if i dared to do that. um, it might've had little or no meaning to them, probably little or no  mhm isn't that, yeah. mhm hm. mhm mhm yup  is this, is it too pretentious to say that uh, we're dealing with something that people might call irony? where, it is but it isn't, you know, uh uh i- w- they're they're doing that but you know that's not what they're really doing. yeah yeah yeah, that's interesting. um, i was in a conversation earlier, this week, with the chair of a doctoral committee that i'm a member of, and i was very close to the uh graduate student doing the work and helped set it up, okay yeah okay. okay. yeah well, i mean the first thought i have is um, my, you know limited but still experience with, some of the things that happen when very well meaning folks here at the university, try to help, help people in the, out in the secondary schools out in the schools out there. when we try to or  when, when we gear up to do, uh professional development, outreach, etcetera. yeah, yeah  yeah, and how easy it is, in the in the interest of wanting to convey this knowledge that we possess, um, to, trample all over, the people who we're purporting to, help, and um, and to be you know and i think questions of respect come into play and i think those those get, those can get, you know tricky like a lot of other things but i think that's something where um, i, i i felt_ i think that um,  well i i i'm sorry i you know  yeah yeah yeah that's that's what i'm talking about. okay  almost, yep.  yeah, you see well here's the thing i mean i'm glad you br- i'm glad you brought it back to that Fred cuz i think you, see, and i i'm i think i'm a little closer to your perspective on this, um, i know i know that i am i i think maybe you're uh you're seeing m- even more there than i think that, than i was able to. i think most of the students thought that it was maybe, they didn't react and say oh, oh she gets it. you know or this is like this is an interesting move for her to make. hm face saving. yeah face saving, exactly. okay okay.  well, we don't know. we don't know. yeah now that puts Nicole who's writing a response, in a pretty neat place because we may learn, more about it. yeah, yeah, yeah we may well. so maybe Jeff what we do, um, um, i- i- remember, the work we just finished up last summer, uh inherited um, Karen Deolavaris's um, work from David Hereford after he died and, yes yeah that might be  yeah  yeah yeah yeah (could) be yeah   yeah yeah yeah i'm g- and i'm glad you said that too cuz it also i mean this this kind of interplay that we have here which is so unusual for us, yeah yeah  yeah, and you just go back to the way Erica, i mean after, uh she w- just to wind up, when Erica wrote, this poem cracked me up, that was dated twelve sixteen, two two sixteen it is (i think) 	1
LEL185SU066.json	can you uh give your attention to uh, to Dan for a moment? uh once again i'm your section rep my name is Daniel Cohen, just wanted to remind you uh, what's going on in S-G-A. i'm gonna send out an email, um i was looking to do it today but it might be tomorrow just to let you know, general email but tomorrow, at four-thirty in Hale Auditorium there's gonna be the forty-second annual business leadership awards ceremony, that's four-thirty, in Hale, Sam Zell, of the Sam Zell and Robert Lurie, Institute for en- Entrepreneurial Studies will be presenting, a section on entrepreneuria- entrepreneurialship, one-oh-one, and um, student government just wanted everyone to know about that and uh try to attend that so it's four-thirty tomorrow in Hale Auditorium, and um, go check it out, it should be very interesting. it's the forty-second annual, leadership_ business leadership award. thank you. uh, okay before we get started today, uh, with, a few announcements regarding class and also, um, uh uh the material we're gonna cover, uh you'll notice there's some microphones here at the front of the room, and that's because uh, for today's class we're being, uh, taped for a veri- very special project that's going on here at the University of Michigan, it has nothing to do, with your grades it has nothing to do with what's going on at the Business School, it has to do with a very special daya- database, um, that they're putting together here, and to tell you a little bit about that, uh Janine is going to explain why, uh we've been chosen to do this thing. just a few reminders, due dates, today by five P-M, your classified ads are due, um the individual writing assignment is due Friday at five, um, couple of re- uh, responses to some questions i've gotten, you can, respond to the questions as questions or you could write your essay just responding to the three questions or you can put it together as an integrated essay, without saying that this is the, plot for one this is two and this is three. so whichever one enables you, to come up with the best argument, how to make the best case for what you're arguing, please follow that format. whichever works best for you, um the other thing is you can use materials through Wednesday's class. so, um, and all of those topics are listed_ again, you gotta be careful not_ you can't possibly use every single concept we've covered, uh choose a select few that you want to use, um that will enable you to uh, make the best diagnosis and um, and best plan of action. another point of clarification, in terms of, write-ups of case questions, you're given prep questions for every case we cover that's to help you prepare for class. i don't expect those to be handed in, except if i announce in advance that i want them, alright? an- and, then you'll be given your automatic, um, your automatic credit for doing it if you turn them in. we do highly suggest that you write them up, for class it enables you to prepare, you then have a record, of the case, for your notes for later when you go back to do assignments, uh but for example today and Wednesday, i do not expect you to hand in write-ups of the questions. uh for next cla- class we are going to be focusing on (Stripe and) Space, okay? that's the case that i want you to focus on again there're prep questions for that, then, you may, w- wanna just jot this down on your syllabus, pages sixty-nine through seventy-three in the in the, Presiding Motivating Jobs that_ those are the pages you wanna focus on just skim the rest, cuz we're gonna be focusing on the job characteristics model, and also the Lawlor reading Choosing an Involvement Strategy. so that's where you wanna focus your attention is on, pages sixty-nine through seventy-three in the Involvement yeah? um as far as the writing assignment's concerned uh if we use, like the, coursepack as sources do you want them documented  um, i think they're a good motivator, i think it uh, brings out competition, in our environment and, um pushes kids to like strive and be the best, mhm mhm, jus- other thoughts? Melissa? um, i think they're a really good motivator i was in the Residential College my first two years, and i totally slacked off, because we got evaluations and we didn't get grades. d- does everybody know what goes on in in the R-C? wh- why don't you explain a little bit. you just get pass-fail, and then you get a little written, explanation as to what, you do in the class and then how, you personally perform in there, so i personally like totally slacked off, because i knew i wasn't getting a grade in the course. so, (xx) (xx) um, i think it really depen- depends on the individual because i know for me, um, i like to learn just to learn  mhm. so, you've just suggested that there are, remember back to the uh, second class? individual differences in how we're going to react to the exact same, type of motivation. other thoughts about this? Dan? um i think grades are definitely a motivator, but i don't know that they motivate, towards the right behavior like what? (Kim) yeah  so, focusing (xx) rewarding A while hoping for B yeah so we have the folly going on there and then there's also, there's another term that was used in your reading anyone, have any thoughts about that? there's something that they they talk about goal displacement right? that the grade is there to try and reinforce, try and motivate a certain type of behavior and instead of, learning the stuff what you're really, reinforcing is getting the grade. that the grade is there to motivate a certain type of behavior. other thoughts about this, how you feel? Kelly? i think sometimes the grade is too   uhuh  it discourages you. i don't think that, the, grades necessarily reflect, learning, either like i don't think they're a good reflection. in classes where i've gotten you know like a a B-minus or something i feel like i've learned far, more over the course of the class than perhaps something where i went in with, knowledge already and just could ace the exam without even, listening, i don't feel like i learned anything in that class so, i don't know as i should be rewarded,  mhm so who n- so grade_ it's not clear what grades are necessarily rewarding or even motivating Rich? i think that a concrete example of this like goal displacement thing is that, like you look at someone's G-P-A, the concept of a G-P-A presupposes that all classes are created equal, but what you have at Michigan especially is that people actively seek out the absolute easiest classes in the school, so wait a second. how'd all of you, end up, here at the Business School where_ how do we treat grades here at the Business School? well well if you look_ even if you wanna get into the Business School for example i mean this is a lotta the times the way they do it they padded their G-P-A with, you know (well) (xx) go ahead... go on. Jason? if you talk to like the admissions people like that's not what they say they say that, they look for the people that take the strong classes and i know for myself that, that's not true cuz i, barely took any, easy classes i took maybe, one easy class that's considered an easy class and, i didn't get all As and, uh like i, did poorly in a lot of classes but,  mhm, so it's schedule grades, other things? David? uh, mine was, more of the, the improper motivation because all through_ like even for a test, you studied very hard but then like often right after the test, i mean, next coupla days i won't even know the information that (xx) but that never happens in organizational behavior. no um, just to take a stab at the Business School again, um uhuh uhuh uhuh so, it's, suggesting that maybe grades aren't the best motivator especially when you get to the Business School Jessica? yeah i was gonna say that, same thing, that he said, when you have like a median that could be a median, you can work your, butt off and you're not gonna g- get_ nine ninety-five could be a B-minus, if everyone knows it so, it takes the emphasis away from like, you knowing it to like you concerned with if everyone else knows it, and it's, uhuh (xx) so it can have like, some dysfunctional effects after all. other thoughts Mike? i also think it depends on, um, how it's graded, like whether it's objective or, subjective, cuz i know that like if something's like cut and dry, you know such as like a- an economics answer like if you n- i i think grades could be a good motivator cuz you're actually learning the information and like, if you put, right answer you're gonna get, the better grade whereas, if you write a paper which is like graded, you know based on your, teacher's interpretation of your paper and you may think it's like really, mhm mm mhm mhm so there so there's some situational factors that come into play, like whether you're at the Business School, whether it's a subjective, so-called subjective, examination of your abilities, or whether it's an objective test where there's data and a right or wrong answer. so one of the reasons, that, we introduce motivation that way is because, you day to day experience with grades what often happens in the workplace which is, you know there's this one type of motivator_ typically in the workplace it's money_ that we think can deliver all sorts of results that we're after, and it, in fact turns out, that maybe it has some, consequences we didn't expect, so we wanna be, particularly careful, in thinking about motivation, in thinking about, what we use to motivate people, and in thinking about, what sorts of things we wanna motivate and we'll look, carefully at the Hauser Foods case, um, in thinking about those questions but, let me give you just a brief overview, of motivation. the first question you wanna answer when you're a manager, when you're in an organization is you wanna understand, what are people being motivated to do? are people motivated to do the tasks that we seek, them to do? right? so we first wanna be able to detect motivation and there are three questions you wanna ask, when you wanna know, if people are motivated or not. the first one is direction right? where is their effort directed? what tasks are getting done? right? this, basic thing, where is their effort directed? the second, is amplitude right? how much effort are they devoting, to a particular task? how much of a task is getting done? that's the second diagnostic question when we wanna figure out if people are motivated, or not, to do something that we want, that we want them to get done. finally persistence, right? how long does their effort last? how long are they doing a particular task? okay those are the three, questions for, detecting whether in fact, what we want to motivate, is being motivated right? we want a particular task to get done, we wanna ask those questions. now why do you care about motivation right? if a task is getting done or people are performing, why do you really care about motivation? well the reason is, quite simple performance, we tend to believe, is a function, of motivation, and skill. right? people can be equipped to do a task but if they're not motivated, who cares how qualified they are they won't get it done. so on the one hand if we want tasks performed, we wanna know about motivation, but we also care about people right? we also care that people, are satisfied in the jobs that they're doing. and so, the way to make sure that they're satisfied, is to motivate them appropriately. so how do you start to think about motivation? and let me introduce, multiple frameworks, all of which you read about for today, in the chapter overview, and there're, there are three categories of frameworks that i, um, that i talked about. uh the first focus is on needs that is the way you motivate people is you find out what their needs are, and then, you address those needs. and the extent to which you can address those needs, will motivate, their behavior. the second looks at, an implicit calculation that models human behavior, as though there's this implicit calculation going on within people's brains, and the third says, well you need to put certain conditions into place within an organization. and when you put those conditions into place, you'll be able to motivate folks. so the needs, frameworks, um one of them, very popular one, is uh Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs the idea is, you need to take care of people's needs, at the lowest level, physiological needs, before you then address, higher-level needs like safety or security's next, then after that there're social needs, right? esteem needs and self-actualization there's this pyramid in your reading, the idea is, people need to have their, most basic needs taken care of you take care of those first, and then you move up the ladder and typically within an organization, it's the higher-level needs that we need to address. right? now, unfortunately though Maslow's hierarchy is incredibly appealing there's been no empirical research supporting it. now, Persberg came along and said, well there's really, two different types of needs. we've got things that are called hygiene factors, and things called motivators. hygiene factors, are the things that have to be in place, for people, not to be dissatisfied. so pay attention there to the double negative right? the idea is, the more of these things you have, doesn't motivate people, but you need a certain threshold level of these hygiene factors, in order for people not to be dissatisfied. right? this will just keep them from being, um upset and disgruntled so, things like, believe it or not, salary, or work policies, certain things have to be in place for people not to be dissatisfied. but then, after that, you can't necessarily motivate people, with more of those hygiene types cuz you then have to rely on the motivators. so motivators include things like the way you design, the job or responsibility the more of them you give people the more you can motivate, the kinds of performance that you want. finally uh, David McClellan, a social psychologist_ and i i talked about his theory when we discussed individual differences but he says, well people differ on their need for achievement their need for affiliation and their need for power. and you should identify what people's different individual needs are, where're they_ who's strong in a need for affiliation? you know what? it might be best to give them a job, where they can, satisfy that need they'll be more of a_ motivated to do it. right? people who are high on the need for achievement, set out really, challenging goals for them. right? need for power you might wanna be able to show somebody, how, the better job that they do the more control the more authority you'll give them. so identify people's individual needs, and then give them the opportunity, to achieve, and to meet those needs now, implicit calculation (in) these theories, and um, i'm gonna give you a handout, at the uh, towards the end of class with, uh models of these theories on them, the idea here is not that people explicitly are systematically making these sorts of calculations, the idea is rather, we can model their behavior, in light of, the calculations that are going on in their minds. so for example there's equity theory. right? the idea with equity theory is that somehow i'm gonna be motivated, by the extent to which, i'm calculating, what i'm getting, in return for my effort compared to what other people are getting in return for their effort. right? so if i'm getting paid a lot of money, for the effort i'm putting in and i see that other people, are getting paid a lot less, for the effort they're putting in, i'm gonna really increase my effort, cuz i wanna see it, as, being somewhat equitable. now, the reverse happens. if i see people, doing the same effort, putting in the same effort i'm putting in, right? the input is the same, and their outcome is a lot bigger they're getting a lot more for it, i'm gonna start to reduce my effort. cuz i wanna even the scales right? i'm calculating somehow in my mind, that, it should be an equitable distribution the outcome, compared to the input, should be the same for me as it is for others. so that's, equity theory there's_ expectancy theory is another sort of way, another sort of, calculation model, that we'll talk about and apply to Hauser Foods we'll talk about that a little later, but the final, framework you might think about, when you consider motivation, is putting in place, the appropriate set of conditions, right? you can either set up, goals, just establish goals doesn't make a difference what people's individual differences are, who cares what the calculations are that are going in their minds, set out, challenging goals, and that can motivate behavior or alternatively there's the idea, that if we set up the right set of reinforcements, the right set of, punishments, and rewards again it doesn't make a difference how people differ, doesn't make a difference what they're calculating, figure out what behavior you want, reinforce it with punishments or rewards. i think um, first thing she should do is, is to_ cuz they kept emphasizing that um, Jay, the guy that headed headed the Florida, team was, one of them, so i think she needs to somehow gain their trust, by, either convincing them that, it's not in, you know, to her advantage to, sell them out to the upper management, and therefore get, some information about how the Florida team manages to, keep their sales, and then, do that for the rest of her district uhuh mhm. uh okay anybody here w- wanna play Jay? anybody here from the Florida sales team? anyone? okay. go ahead, Brenda, you're having a conversation with Jay. you gotta get_ you have a plan of action go ahead. you have some ideas let's see the follow-through. um, so Jay how do you, keep your sales uh ten percent above the prime, throughout the year? good teamwork we work together,  c'mon Jay, you know, um, i don't know you know we uh, we cover for each other we make sure we get on each other's uh butts per se and you know, make sure everyone's getting the job done, help each other out you don't think i'm gonna sell you out do you? sell us out to who? i don't i don't understand what you're saying. (hey,) alright, settle down. so, you know, uh, believe it or not this is probably how the conversation would likely start. and that's, a good line of attack right? try and get their trust now there is somebody who knows, exactly what's going on down in Florida. right? and a lot of you are gonna go off you're gonna become, maybe investment bankers or consultants or you may manage organizations, you may become lawyers, you're gonna have access to confidential information right? confidential information someone's taken you, in, and counted on you, counted on your honesty and your secrecy, and yet you know that if you share that information, a much, larger number of people, are going to benefit from that information. so suppose you're the researcher, hired by Columbia University you're just down there doing research, what are you gonna do with that information? what do you think you'd do in this situation? any thoughts? Danielle? well since it's confidential you can't, she can't, go to Brenda Cooper but, what she can do, is in talking to the people in Florida, she can kind of convince them that, Brenda Cooper isn't out to do_ to, harm them she just wants to work with them to motivate them to be better salespeople. (yell out) again, go ahead, let's let's hear it. hear it i'm starting?  (and who am i?) (alright) one more time. how's this gonna go? well i know that you have, a very low level of trust for Brenda, and the, senior management but really what they're_ they're not out to punish you or to harm you, they just want Hauser Foods to be one of the better companies in the industry. and so by cheating them and not trusting them, you're slowing down the progress of Hauser Foods so, really there's nothing to fear there. yeah but see i'm i'm getting paid with a little bitty salary that i get, rewarded based on my, you know performance here as our little group employment so, why would i jeopardize, you know having our sales get, bumped up next year and not being able to meet our goals and not getting paid while the people in the head office, you know get paid the same regardless of, you know how, we perform so, we're gonna take care of ourselves and, screw the company. go ahead if i, if i were Brenda i think i would, uh push to have their compensation switched instead of having, them compensated based on, um, the amount they exceed their, their sales plan every year, i would have them, compensated like solely on commission, so based on how much, like how many units they sell, uhuh ah so you might think about starting to tinker with, with how they're compensated so let's start to uh (xx) increased demand for your product as well as uh diversify into other, lines, besides just baby food increase demand what was the second thing? um diversify your um, market diversify your market. with, other products  uh you wanna be like, the best in your field  uh they wanted new ideas for selling the products  uh it's not explicitly stated but i'm assuming a loyal staff because you depend on them for innovation and product development  profits and growth. you're basically you're basically  they want their staff to work a hundred percent, at their hundred percent level. to do everything they can do to, increase sales  are we assuming that the uh, senior management has the same desires and interests as the stockholders? or are we? well suppose you did assume that?   maybe they want job security ah   ah they want their staff to meet the plan no matter what. meet the plan loyal customer base? they want, they don't just want a loyal staff they also want um while they want the staff to, meet the plan- plan and, be_ give hundred percent effort they want perfect paperwork turned in for everything. ah she heard that, that if she meets the sales plan or whatever the chances are good for her being promoted  she wants the district managers under her to, communicate more, hm?  well this is more of like her own personal goal but she wants to do well in her job  uh, i think she wants job security because she's not entirely confident, in keeping her position so job security other things? Fu Keung? large bonus from, business sales one more time bonus from increase of sales, i mean the bonus from, the (mark) the marks in business strategies. so. and get bonus yep, potentially large bonus. so she wants to increase sales, cuz she wants the bonus from it. go ahead Phil? she wants innovation and, more motivated salespeople, working under her, aha other tthings? good (Aveetra?) uh, she wants, the district managers if they have any new idea to share it with others so that, everyone could benefit from it hah uh she wants trust with her district managers. (tops,) trust, Rebecca? um i think she wants to be like an extension of the senior management, because um, they're all in what Atlanta Georgia and the sales team's down in Florida. mhm well in accordance with that i feel like she wants power especially over the Florida sales team. she feels like she can't, do anything without them. huh and i guess in addition to sharing ideas more than anything else in her life i thought she wants to know Florida's secret. ah. they want to protect themselves   aha, oh so there's something else they want? they wanna maintain their strong performance numbers  they wanna, like make large bonuses while working in a relaxed environment okay so there's two things there. um, they really want profit-sharing, when it comes down to like, producing their secret, they only get a thousand dollars if they do that uhuh oh  they want their freedom, to individually do their job and freedom from what in particular? freedom from uh like the district manager not telling them exactly what to do. uhuh... and is there something in particular? they just wanna be left alone and there's one thing that really bugs_ Pierre? i was gonna say they want the need for affiliation. okay, and with who? uh, just their coworkers, uhuh  they want, to be, a true team. when the new guy came in and tried to, tried to do everything himself they, they wanted to make_ they kinda cut him down until he became, a team player. mhm. that's kind of_ that's, the kind of affiliation they want other things? Ron? for the amount of, money that they gain they wanna keep the, the work load about the same aha, so um they complain about the amount of time they have because they have to fill out so much_ so many papers for those people in Atlanta they say they don't have enough time to actually do the job they're supposed to be doing. so, like, you want, time, free  so, they want some security there, Supriya? they care more for the betterment of their team than the company. aha, so i think it's actually they want control over the sales plan because, they're they're you know going crazy over why, over over why they might lose their jobs and, and if they just had some input into the plan, cuz there's a disconnect between what the executives want and what they deliver, uhuh aha. Dror? building on what he said they wanna keep the sales, figure, low enough, so as not, so as not to increase the expectations of the senior management, aha so we can kinda control things if we can maintain the sales quota. good Zack? i think they all feel like they're, uh somehow beating the system and that gives them a feeling of power ah  um i think they want, to reserve a bigger bonus when their suggested_ suggestion plan works.  mhm it's not so good right now. no not so good. are they increasing demand successfully here? no. no we're not doing so good there. communication a lotta stuff flowing between, we're not doing so good there. are we diversifying products at this company? no   not (now.) no decrease in numbers  three percent i said it's  no no no nope no no no no 'm'm no no yes oh yeah, mhm yeah  yeah yes no yes yeah yeah Florida uh they wanted to, like if if they help, and the whole company does well then they can keep their jobs but if they don't help the company they_ like the the rewards don't really match what kind of inputs they wanna give out. okay and so- and and wha- what's the company rewarding and what's it getting and what does it want? and what_ i mean what's going on here? you read about the folly wha- what's, happening here? anyone know? Jason? the company is rewarding for, continued growth but to_ in order to get that continued growth they have to work harder and harder and harder, and these people, don't wanna_ like, the time effort that they would have to put in to work harder and harder and harder isn't worth it to them. okay so th- the company wants more and they're not getting the right sort of stuff Mike? um the company is rewarding competition within the, company   alright so that_ so the reward_ they want competition externally and they're getting it internally, Paul? so there's reinforcement for the Florida team to do what they're doing right now and keeping a secret that they why? because if they did_ the al- the alternative is which is? giving the information to the, senior managers would just would, just increase their work level and the same amount of_ with the same amount of pay they're getting right now. aha. so if i share my ideas what happens?  you_ they lose out they, they lose out and what does senior management want after all? innovation. paperwork. paperwork. they're rewarding paperwork. and they're rewarding what? secrecy secrecy no there's a bunch of extras here. oh thanks. paperwork pardon? paperwork.  meet the sales plan. meet the plan i'm not really sure is it innovate? right. i just wanna say i think this, meet the plan concept is really ridiculous i mean, we want them to sell as many things as they possibly can. we want them to do their best we don't want them to, to fix them up with some medio- you know mediocre standard, and say well as long as you get this you're doing a good job when really it's not the best they can do. right so, let's look at why maybe some of that's happening. it's a great point let's see why that's happening. now, if they put the effort in can they meet the plan? i mean if they do the work, then what probability would you put on that? let's just use, low moderate or high. if they do the, do the work, if they put in the effort, can they meet, the existing sales plan? mhm high. high. high moderate moderate maybe because, i mean they've been in the market for, thirty years and they haven't had so many new ideas. so they're sitting on a pretty good one down in Florida, but, you know it's a moderate probability. we can put the effort in, we might get a new idea. you get a bonus. you get your bonus... anything else happen if we meet plan? Kurt? you get the opportunity to meet the bonus next year. you get the opportunity to do what? to meet the bonus again the next year it's not just a one-time deal it's something that can be recurrent. okay so, you can make it a recurring bonus here... what else happens if you if you meet plan? Dror? it raises expect- uh expectations. okay. positive negative you keep your job  positive. your level of, income, dollars don't go up they stay the same year after year because, your expectations are going up but your your income is the same. aha. so this might be, a little bit more of a_ it might be a double negative cuz of what's happened here. Cheol? job security goes down. because it becomes more difficult, to uh, be uh right? so we better hope that someone in addition to Albi discovered, the new market. how about paperwork? what's the outcome? if we do the paperwork what happens...? Marcy? you keep, you keep Atlanta happy, with your, progress.  um they like, cuz it gives 'em their freedom, it gets Atlanta  um, you have less time to do things like cold calls... uh getting customers and things like that. and how do we feel about that? we have less time to do cold calls and sales do we like that? no (definitely not) you get a, really small thousand dollar bonus. and why do they think that's really small? because, if you come up a good new idea then, you know the company's gonna raise their sales expectations you know they're gonna they're gonna think with the new idea you'll be able to sell a lot more and, in the long term it's gonna decrease your income and you have to work a lot harder. mm and so_ and and why in particular do you think we think this one thousand dollar bonus is like, alright anyone wanna apply anything (xx)  um, that the theory, that_ i think it was like, equity i think where uh, they're putting in something that's gonna make the company a lotta money right why bother? anything else that we get from innovating or new ideas? something else happen here? Rich? well i think that this_ like, our expectations are gonna be raised because, now i mean, you know, th- th- the uh, the plans are gonna are gonna go up and it's gonna get more difficult for us to, to meet the plans and, that's obviously a negative. huh. (but you got this) other negative. also they still have to take time away from their making cold calls and things like that, meaning they would have to work longer hours. aha so, there's another thing we don't want. John? well if they can keep the new ideas secret like they have been doing then, it's positive because it's like a free ride for them, so aha and, what do i want as, what do i want as Brenda Cooper? do i want to keep 'em secret? sorry, do i wanna keep 'em, secret? no you wanna so does everybody have a group number? okay hold on, and here, is where you can assemble in your groups and remember the idea is you wanna come up, you're Brenda Cooper, what is the bonus system you're going to use? what's the bonus system you're going to use? um, and is it alright? are_ do the group ones_ will you agree, is it okay if they tape you as part of the group discussion for the web? just let them know and you can be over here. please make sure you introduce yourselves to one another, before you start the task. i (xx) should go around and say everybody's name Paul Andy i'm Kate Adam Dan Zack what's your name   well i think uh,   i think one of the important things they have to do is like, in the following year when they raise expectations they also have to give 'em like a pay raise, too, like (xx) see i think there's a bigger issue here though and that's that the sales like, expectations are set from up above and people have no say in um, in what will happen, in what the goals will be for the next term, and i think that they almost need to redirect the attention, and have it st- begin with the um, sales crews that are in the different locations that are_ fall underneath Brenda, have them set goals for themselves and give input, that way they feel, like they'll set goals, that they think will be, um, feasible, and what they think will be um, i don't know what the word is but um attainable. right yeah i think that's important we learned about that at the very beginning, if yo- if, if the upper management sets the goals then the lower management's_ i mean the lower people aren't gonna wanna do it  it's like on- it was one of the first   it like said no it was like um, it was just, it was just where, like that, it was one of those uh, ideas of like, if the employee sets, the  yeah yeah i have it also,  it's on the same page as the expectancy theory ye- yes right entire- entirely that so anyways i i was also thinking okay especially especially for like the new ideas they bring right  and, to go along with um, like setting go- setting goals like at the lower levels they should just like increase the communication and that's   yeah i think a- at a company level i mean at a, at a district level with with Brenda and and as a company level at all because if_ everyone in the_ all the salespeople are like_ basically hate the company, you know? yeah what do you think about the uh, paperwork, also? is that something that we're gonna just_ we would eliminate, or? at least decrease yeah i think we should decrease paperwork. well (and then) we don't know what the paperwork is yeah yeah yeah, i think that's a good idea  (xx) mhm i think the problem with um, separate from that, with the with the whole bonus system and with uh, increasing sales, were that they were always, they_ if you pushed the maximum they increased the sales it was kinda like, if you had a really really great year one year then, the next year it could be like not such a good year but you still ro- yo- they're_ you're expected to get at least ten percent above that. so in essence not, creating, any expectations of sales based on the previous year but, kinda based on like a, like a moving scale or like, like costs (us) i don't know like something like average growth yeah i like that, yeah, i definitely think, that it's ridiculous that they always increase the plan... um, no matter what  right cuz you have an incredible year one year because right yeah what if you just went, entirely on_ based on commission rather than bonus as a, as a percentage of your sales. do you think that would motivate in the same way? it would but, in some instances like some markets might be_ have a higher demand than others. so that, i mean if you had better sales manager in one mar- (xx) market, it_ you would maybe get cheated because they don't have the access of more employees but, then yo- s- it might be good to set like, some kind of, commission off of like, okay you're expected maybe this much, and if, after you exceed that exceed  well it could be like a team commission, like if your team does, (oh yeah)      shut up. yeah. it was Disney World though that's what it was. yeah take just another couple minutes to jot down your ideas and then let's, reconvene. okay did we, touch on the main points (xx) (i dunno) he just took away (so)  yeah our basis of commission is gonna be_ or i mean our basis of reward is what? commission? or... so, um  yeah  yeah, i thought of a base salary. so, so say increase base salary, and still have bonuses but make them,  uh, to stimulate   right i'll have to jot that down yeah so basically (then) it's a commission. yeah it is a commission but it's,   uhuh okay so you're not punished for, increasing the quota. but, you're in fact rewarded for it. other ideas? Mike? we kind of like thought that in like the short term, and then in the long term like, in the long term there's a lot of like, better alternatives as far as like her going through senior management and getting things like passed but like, something is due to like profit-sharing whereas like, if you increase profits and you're getting some percent of it reflec- reflected in your bonuses as opposed to like a one-time deal, also like you know, stock options or, things that just happen in the short term, where she has little control over what senior management does it just, um, kinda like (managing) the role system (xx) in such a way that it's like um, rewarding the entire region, therefore like they might be like_ they might_ one district might be more prone to like, share their ideas because if someone's slacking in their district then, they're gonna actually be hurt. it has its like, negative side, but like as a whole it might, stimulate and how would you do that? any of the groups have thoughts about how you would do that? h- how might you do it? how might you, do that so you get the whole region_ you reward performance in the whole region? any, any thoughts about how you might do that? Kurt? you could have little bonuses for the whole region instead of specific districts, say the whole, region meets their sales quota then, everybody in the region gets a bonus but the region doesn't then nobody gets a bonus. so therefore, if we find out, that there's an elderly market for baby food, maybe we won't keep it to ourselves because if the whole region increases in sales, we get a bigger bonus other thoughts? what else might you do for the bonus system? good Jessica? we said that, um you should take (xx) away from like, the internal company and make it like, just, industry competition, cuz the whole problem is that, like the Florida people don't wanna help the, Chicago people or whatever, and, um, the whole, company, wants to help each other then they'll do better overall mhm so just maybe some_ create some, regional, competition here any other, other thoughts, from any of the groups? good Daniel? we're talking for, as far as bonuses instead of each year, your growth, your your sales have to be like ten percent more in order to, to to get a bonus, instead make it, based on, a the average economic growth, in the in_ as a whole i- in the economy and on that you get the bonus not based on like_ so you, you're taking away from like, if you do really well this year, you have to do even better next year this way it's more like you're doing well, and each, it it's independent almost. so there's some kind of objective criterion that we're linking, the reward to, right? we're gonna look at general, economic conditions, Adam,  mhm, so it's a way to to build the corporate spirit, in the long term, if we can get, the attention of senior  uhuh uhuh uhuh so, and and it'll also give 'em that sense of consistent earnings right? that that that they were after, Marcy? to increase innovation um, sometimes companies if you, introduce a new idea say they, introduce to the elderly market, and the sales of the whole company go up b- by ten percent, that team would be rewarded a certain percentage of that. uhuh, as a bonus you're thinking more of the company as a whole rather than just yourself. so our fate isn't just how we do down here it's how the whole, company does. good. Beth? we brainstormed a little bit kinda combining those last two where, um, the increase in base salary would come as a result of, innovation and new ideas so that they would see kind of a long-term effect ah mhm, David? uh, one of the things we came up with, is that if they sort of centralized the paperwork, then they could sell more, without feeling that they were spending more time, selling, because they said oh we have to do the paperwork so we can't sell, well they'd, be working the same amount of time but could still sell more, and we could get a bonus also. aha so there's a way we can reconfigure the tasks that they're doing which is a perfect transition to Wednesday's class, we're gonna look at the way jobs are structured to motivate, but you see there's a variety of ways that you can think about motivating people. what i wanna call your attention to is, oftentimes when we think about changing reward schemes, we think a lot about well what new arrows might we add, right? what new, performances do we want what new outcomes could we add? you also wanna think about well how do you get rid of obstacles? what what sorts of arrows might you wanna erase? like, how could you get rid of this right? if you meet plan expectations go up. and remember they're dealing with a mature product here, it's a mature product line so if you keep ratcheting up the quota, you're just not gonna get it. there's no more market for baby food, other than what we found with the elderly so we really do depend on this. so you wanna focus, both on adding, arrows right? adding outcomes and, looking at which arrows that currently exist right? which outcomes related to which performances, are obstructing the sort, the sorts of uh, effort the sorts of uh performances that we're looking for, how do we get rid of the obstructing, arrows? now, this is in a handout that you can pick up, um on your way out there are two piles it's the exact same handout, pick one up on your way out, the the idea is look when you're thinking about rewards as managers, make sure you're linking, the performance you want, to the rewards right? that wasn't happening at Hauser Foods. rewards weren't linked to the performance that they wanted they wanted new ideas, that's wh- that wasn't what was being rewarded, and make sure you're very careful to think about what is it that i want to, reward anyway? is it effort? is it ability? what is it that i wanna reward? or, results i mean grades, tend to, reward results, when in fact a lot of what we get, a lot of what what we might like rewarding sometimes is effort and ability. and there're different times you wanna reward, effort, different times you wanna reward, ability sometimes, you just wanna, reward, results but be very clear about, what it is you're after and therefore what you're going to reward. make sure you pick up a handout i'll be in my office in about ten minutes till seven. um, and see you Wednesday. oh please just_ can i get your attention? if you were asked to fill out a pink form could you make sure that you fill that out before you leave? and drop it off, up front? thanks. 	1
SEM340JG072.json	o- of the groups who're presenting are you guys gonna be, focussing specifically on the crack cocaine thing or generally on, um, sort of sentencing? a little bit of both mostly   are we trying to move all together?   are we gonna sit in a big line across the room or at the table? just like three and three okay. over here? you like it when we're like we're on_ don't you like it when we're on this side, both on the same sides? both on the same side that's fine if you wanna do that, okay, that's fine. i don't wanna sit that close to them (xx) okay. so you guys sit over there and we'll sit over here. okay. they're trying to get away from the,  yeah i'm gonna try and disguise my voice now if i would've thought ahead i would've had you guys abandon the Sentencing Commission and uh, dissenting and, majority opinions, but that's another story that we'll get into in a minute okay i don't know if we're gonna need any more (beside some) emails about illness so, okay, uh let's get moving, um, we are going to talk today about uh, uh, sentencing policy and the war on drugs and whether or not it made sense, and we have we have, both sides of the story here. uh do the teams have clever names this time?  definitely i ju- i just forgot what uhuh   uhuh  yeah, but that's a, and's little, there you go.  and apple pie. efforts, towards and towards is little too.    it was our best one. drugs so that's, WEED yes. aren't we clever? and uh, okay. and and no no clever name on the (xx) uh. our our subject is much too serious. (xx) can somebody open the window? um, and uh, i i forget, so you guys were, uh sort of pro pro, oh no you were you were con before. right. okay, um no pointing to the cameras um. uh. why don't we get started? why don't, i- if_ unless there's a preference about who starts i think it's probably best to start with the, um, sort of pro, drug war side. um, sort of, you guys can have something to respond to it's, put out a positive, uh, approach then attack it. you know, that's the way we go (xx) one is JAIL right? judicious no. did you get this?  as opposed to the legal (lawbreakers...) nobody remembers that once we, you justify the acronym. um, okay so i uh without further ado we'll start with, uh the recently named JAIL group, um,  okay, my intervention is about a, connection between drugs and crime. and drug and especially crack cocaine is associate with, system- systemic crime. research allowed the enforcement official report that much of the violence, associated with crack cocaine, stem from attempts by competing factions to consolidate control of drug distribution in urban, areas. for example, uh twenty-seven-point-nine percent of the crack offender possess (xx) weapons compared to fifteen-point-one of powder cocaine offender, and are more likely to have more extensive criminal rec- record. uh, twenty, twenty-point-four of crack defen- defend- defendants, have the high- highest criminal, history. United States Intensive Commission, shows that crack cocaine defendant also are more likely to have a recent criminal reco- record. thirty-three percent, are under a preexisting criminal justice sentence at the time of they most recent federal offense. the Commission f- found that forty-eight percent of men and sixty-two percent of women who use crack, engage in petty property crime and a significant minority of the main committed fairly high, high number of violent, or potentially violent offense. this (history) also report that sixty-nine percent of women crack user engage in prostitution. the prevalence of cocaine supports babies children, neglected or abandoned by mother addict to drugs, an increase an illegitimate births or an increase in gratuitous violence. heroin, cocaine, crack and methamphetamines are highly toxic substance, and (xx) of to then engage in all kinds of destructive behavior, from preying on family member to assaulting a stranger to abusing children. okay, um, i'm gonna to get into a little bit more now about the, sentencing disparity between powder cocaine and crack cocaine. we think it's, pretty self-evident that drugs are a real problem, um, that they are very destructive, that they create lots of destructive behavior. uh but what, i think is maybe not so, evident to people who criticize these sentencing laws is the fact that, crack cocaine simply results in greater harms to society. it's more dangerous, it's more destructive, um, it's basically the worst drug that is out there on the streets today. now because of that we feel that like the sentencing disparities currently in effect under federal guidelines, are legitimate. they shouldn't be lessened and in fact you could even make a case that they're not stringent enough. um, so lemme talk about why crack is, is worse. first off, uh, pharmacologically, um, it's worse, than powder cocaine, you can_ you know some people try and claim they're the same drug, that's simply not true, it's true that they have the same active chemical ingredients, you know crack is produced from powdered cocaine but to say the two are the same is like saying that hemp is the same as marijuana. they're, sure they're the same plant but there's a vast difference in potency. the same is true of crack and powder cocaine and this of course comes from the method of administration, um by smoking the crack the effect is much more intense, it's also much more short lived. um because crack or, and powder cocaine are not pharmacologically or physically addictive but psychologically addictive, the shorter more intense high leads to a quicker and greater craving which leads to more addiction, so this obviously makes it a more dangerous more destructive drug. in addition, this shorter more intense high leads to binging. um this can lead to all kinds of problems. it leads to more crime, as Jorge talked about um to fuel these cravings, it also leads to more destructive um behavior like sexually risky behavior sex for drugs, um that sort of thing. so, i think that, to say that they're the same drug is naive and not at all true. now another, set of factors that makes crack more dangerous can kinda be grouped under the heading of, the characteristics of the crack market. um, Jorge's already talked a little bit about, uh the, violence that's, you know highly correlated with the, crack markets across the country. but there's also other uh things that fall under this heading. there's the marketability of crack, uh it's able to be sold in small, uh packages for only five to ten dollars. um this means that it's basically accessible to everyone, particularly children, particularly, the people who are economically disadvantaged, um and you know that's actually born out by, uh the statistics that the Sentencing Commission uh looks at. you know of those who've used cocaine in the last year, uh the more twelve- to seventeen-year-olds used crack, twenty-six percent than any other age group. so it's not just a, a theory that it's more accessible to children there's more children using crack. uh, which you know obviously disturbs us due to its high potential for addiction. um also there's a high rate of involvement of juveniles and women in the crack trade. um because of way the trade is organized a lotta street corner selling it's very, sort of uh disorganized, lends itself well to the type of, employees, if you will and also they're viewed as less susceptible to prosecution. so we feel like getting people involved in crime would maybe, you know we would like to see involved in positive, um things in life as opposed to crack and the crack trade. um, also as, as we've talked a little bit about the more likelihood of high risk behavior, the binging factor again also means that if a pregnant woman is smoking crack as opposed to snorting it, there's the likelihood that she'll expose her baby to higher levels of the substance, so that also comes into play. um, i guess finally, you know, to talk about, um, the issue of well, you know a a a a certain amount of powder cocaine can be turned into a much greater amount of crack cocaine, we sort of think that, regardless of what powder cocaine may or may not be turned into at some indeterminate point in the future, the fact is that once somebody takes that step and converts it to crack they're then selling a more dangerous drug and they need to be punished, uh, you know they need to have a harsher punishment levied on them. i mean we wanna see the day when no crack is sold at all. we wanna see the day when no drugs of any kind, illegal drugs that is are sold on the streets. uh but as crack is the worst we want to see that go down first. so we think that, you know the pu- the penalties are already very stiff and yet you still have people producing crack, selling it on the streets, we want to see the penalties so stiff, that dealers don't want to touch crack. you know if you want crack you'll have to convert the powder into crack in your own kitchen, um, you know that right there would eliminate a certain segment of the market, children who don't have access to that, you know, or don't have the ability or the access to a kitchen to turn it into crack, some economically disadvantaged i mean, you know, i- i- we we think that perhaps, frankly that the penalties and or the disparity isn't high enough. okay great, that was, great. and i know they all firmly believe all that stuff. okay. um, i'm gonna start us off. i'm gonna basically provide, kinda introduction, uh, to our arguments, um, then i'll turn it over to the two of them. i'd i'd like to start out with some statistics, actually just to get us thinking about some of the issues involved, in the war on drugs. um, first, in nineteen ninety-six, ninety-three percent of all federal drug war spending went to law enforcement efforts, while only seven percent went to treatment, and other strategies. um, in the early nineteen seventies in New York the Rockefeller Drug Laws mandated harsh prison terms and forbade, plea bargaining. a massive multi-year evaluation concluded, implementation of the laws had no effect on drug trafficking drug use or drug related health problems. in nineteen eighty, twenty-five percent of federal prisons were drug of- excuse me, nineteen eighty twenty-five percent of federal prisoners were drug offenders, by nineteen ninety-two this number had increased to fifty-eight percent. typical estimates of the average annual cost of holding one prisoner ranged from twenty thousand to thirty thousand dollars, highe- higher on average than the annual tuition at Harvard University. under nineteen eighty-eight federal law possession of more than five grams of crack cocaine triggers a minimum sentence of five years in prison. simple possession of any quantity of, powdered quar- cocaine or any other drug is punishable by a maximum, of one year in prison. after ninety, after nineteen eighty nonwhite drug arrest rates rose steadily and then skyrocketed. by nineteen eighty-eight they were five times higher than, white rates. and then finally average time served in federal prison for drugs is seventy-eight months for rape, sixty-seven months. okay so those statistics were basically like i said just to get us thinking, about some of the issues. um, there are two themes to the arguments that we're gonna present. uh the first, theme concerns um, uh the two different ways you can categorize, um approaches to to drugs. um the first way is supply side, uh the supply-side approach and second si- second is the demand-side approach. um, suppl- supply-side efforts include law enforcement, um, general law enforcement in cities local communities uh interdiction along borders, like the border between the United States and and Mexico and, uh financial support to other countries that um, from where a lot of drugs that reach the United States originate. um, demand-side efforts uh target the demand for drugs. um, mass media education programs, drug education programs in schools such as the DARE program, uh, drug abuse treatment programs. and finally law enforcement efforts aimed, at possession of drugs. um, so basically you know, there are two main, uh categories of efforts um supply side and demand side. um, our argument is simply that there should be a balance, we're not saying that there shouldn't be laws against drugs, we're not saying that, that shouldn't be a a a one of the, one of the central foci, i guess, of of uh, drug enf- drug strategy. but we're saying that there should be a balance between the two. right now, as a statistic on the federal spending indicates, there's a huge imbalance ninety-three, percent versus seven percent. um, research has shown that both types of strategies can be effective, supply and, supply-side and demand-side strategies. um, so we are simply advocating for for a balance of the two. um, furthermore if- uh, an imbalance towards the supply side um, is very expensive and, a lot of research shows that the difference between a balanced approach, a balance between supply and demand and an, approach that's completely supply there's no, there's basically very little added benefit, to that. so, and the second argument basically, um is about uh the equity issues, or the second theme i should say in our argument it is, is equity. um basically one of this, one of the main, strategies of law enforcement um, is actually, a a demand, strategy. um, uh sending a message, by these laws, um, like mandatory sentences, and uh those sorts of laws. sending a message that, drugs are wrong and that if you do drugs, um, that you'll pay for it. that that's also a demand strategy. um we think though that making that a demand strategy has resulted in a lot of, inequity, um between, um blacks Hispanics and, sentences that they receive, um and and the law enforcement presence in their communities versus whites. um, um, and we think that given given statistics show that um most felony defendants are poor, badly educated un- or underemployed, not part of a stable household, and black. um the efforts of the government which is made up of largely, white middle and upper class, people the effort of the government to, uh make law enforcement a demand strategy basically results, in lots of, poor people ending up in jail, um when their efforts are really directed um at middle-class, and upper-class white kids. so, that's the second theme, and so i'll turn it over to Ally now. okay, um the first question that i would like to ask is whether, the successes of the drug war are balanced with, and i would say that they are fairly limited successes, whether they're balanced with um the costs which i would say are fairly high, both um in terms of economics and in terms, of the effects on communities and on individuals, um as well as, sort of the detriment that they have to, some of the ideals that we hold like equity, as being, pretty fundamental part of the rights that we enjoy as citizens. um, first of all, i would say that the supply side approach hasn't accomplished, very much of what it hopes to, although granted, as the other side said um there are, tremendous increases in prison population, um which has led to some decrease in crime, but, the next logical step to that argument i think is fairly obvious that, of course if everyone was in prison then, the whole community would be safer in fact, traditionally, the upper classes tend to be very happy in police states. um you don't have a lot of people, who are really unhappy under um, say for example Franco in Spain. during his reign a lot of the upper and middle classes really enjoyed, that the power of the police, um and that presence in the community. so just something to balance out sort of what, their argument is over on that side. but, as in terms of it actually being a success, um if the war on drugs was indeed a success then, the risk of dealing would be so high that the availability of, the availability of drugs would be much lower thus increasing costs. however the, the increase, the costs of drugs has not significantly increased to um, dissuade people from using them and, massive arrests if they were indeed able to reduce this um supply, we should have have our streets cleared by now we have tons of people in prisons. however as has been shown, um these massive sweeps on drug sellers has really just_ they're replaced almost immediately upon, being arrested and placed in prison. that particular approach is, clearly unsuccessful. um, the other costs, Jim already touched upon some of them um, including, the harsher penalties and how they've led to an increase in, not not just in terms of enforcement but also in the cost for, court costs prosecution and the increase in the prison costs which would include, not just the twenty to thirty thousand per year per prisoner, but also the cost of new prisons which range between fifty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars per prison. um, when you multiply that out by states and federal tha- that, turns out to be quite a lot of money. um, but on top of, sort of the costs of, of balancing the cost versus the effectiveness of this particular strategy we also have to look at the question of equity um, in terms of, sort of sen- strategy that's really made our prison popu- population disproportionately minority. um, in terms of where blacks fit in, cocaine use they are fifteen percent, fifteen percent of the black population is involved in, use of cocaine whereas they represent ninety percent of those who are imprisoned for um cocaine drug offenses. um that's obviously, a huge disproportion in that particular, arena. i'd just like to throw out a little quote here i'm gonna try to wrap up i'm, not trying to be over long here. but, going into the war on drugs, there was a certain amount of awareness that this was going to targe- target this particular populations, disproportionately, as um senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, okay, i'm going to talk about the uh, sort of what Jim talked about the intro the two pronged approach, that we think should be taken to reforming the war on drugs. two prongs are fifty-fifty, even treatment in supply controls and second reform of sentencing laws, like our crack cocaine, disparity law, well, the disparity, in those laws. uh, first, is fifty-fifty, even treatment. like Jim said our current spending, is of seven percent on demand-side strategies and nine-three percent, on supply-side strategies and these failures are costly. for every dollar we spend, on supply-side strategies we lose money. we lose somewhere between, somewhere between two dollars and an additional dollar. and i guess that the three of us think that, this loss of money could be acceptable if results, were being produced, but they're not. as Ally and Jim talked about we have, exploding prison populations which are, costly in and of themselves, huge racial disparities we haven't seen a massive decline in the amount of drugs used. and so, we think there should be a more more even, distribution between s- treatment, and enforcement. and treatment includes things like education rehabilitation and harm reduction strategies. and um, doing harm reduction strategies education rehabilitation, studies have found uh that, for every dollar you invest you save about seven, seven dollars and forty-six cents, which is fifteen times more cost effective than a law enforcement strategy. um, we understand that there are are some, problems with treatment. you can, people can take some, swipes some whacks at whether or not treatment works, um but i think we think that there's three things that are important to keep in mind, when you look at whether or not treatment is effective currently. first keep in mind that it is competing with a resource deficiency of seven to ninety-three percent. second, keep in mind that it's judged only by abstinence programs and that honest drug education or some reform to drug education might be a good idea. and third, keep in mind that it's still more effective than locking people up for drugs strategies which gives them no chance for treatment, and is more expensive and more inequitable. second thing that we want to talk about is, reform of sentencing laws. uh, like Jim touched on in the early seventies, we did have mandatory minimums which we repealed, because we found that they, were not solving for rehabilitation were increasing social alienation were not solving for drug use, and, thus we got, thus we got rid of them. and so, we propose that maybe we should change the mandatory minimum laws that we have, for disparity between crack and cocaine. uh, i think that you're pretty clear on what those laws are. there's a gap which is one hundred-to-one, of possession. you're, the sentence is a hundred times, or a hundred times more harsh for crack. um, the per- the change that we would propose would look at the severity of the crime, and not just put people in jail for a mandatory minimum. i think a lot of the things that Justin discussed are things which are reasonable if there's more crime, being associated with the trade if someone gets killed during the trade uh, of a of a drug if someone uses a gun. those are things that should be taken into account in terms of severity, but all those things while reasonable, don't justify a mandatory minimum of one hundred-to-one different disparity where you don't look at any aspects of anything that happened during the crime, you just immediately put someone in jail, or actually in prison for, for five years. and uh, so, so i think that, i'm gonna kinda read, i know that's not always thrilling when somebody reads at you but, some of the things that would be taken into consideration if you got rid of mandatory minimums you'd use these sort of guidelines. um, you could take into consideration okay great. WEED and JAIL have their positions on the table. and uh, now why don't we start with some rebuttals before we go to questions from the, from the audience here. you guys wanna take it away? whatever um... okay. well first of all, you guys talk about the, prison populations and overflowing etcetera etcetera changes in drug arrests and imprisonment policies since nineteen seventy-four only account for eight percent, of the increase in the prison population. this is not a- an enormous increase, compared to how much, the prison population has grown, drugs are not necessarily the cause for the bulk of it. changing the sentencing to e- encompass all of the thirteen points that you mentioned Missy, would, take too long. it's already, already as i mentioned before only, four percent of, every tr- of drug dealers are punished, uh, and if we want to, for all of their deals we want to take them to trial and take into account all of the different variables that you mentioned, it will take too long. punishments will not be swift they will not be certain and they will not be severe. because, since the drug war has started the crack market has, is no longer expanding, is evidence that the war works, and because there is no market expansion competition among dealers has increased, which has led to increased violence. this increased violence is not associated with powder cocaine and, if we, don't punish, them more severely and more strictly it will, the violence will continue to increase, um... don't know. w- um, i i can keep going there if you if you want, um, i guess to talk about again about punishments um, versus treatment. you guys talk about a fifty-fifty split um, that you wanna see. uh, i mean okay great. one last, word, and we'll open it up. (go) um i'll start. um, i'll talk a little bit about some of the different things people have said about sentencing or reforming sentencing guidelines and a little bit about, about treatment, and then, if any of you have anything to say just jump in whenever i'm done. um, the first concern i think about reforming sentencing laws is that sent- the, reforming them would take too long. it would have_ there's, you know there's a lot of factors that you have to consider but, uh i i do think we can be judicious we can have a little length, in order that we preserve racial equity in this country. i feel that, you know fifteen more minutes is probably worth it, to say, to have s- things that are much more racially fair, particularly when our original laws aren't based o- our original laws are based more on conjecture when we don't really have studies which prove, a lot of the reasons why we have the one hundred-to-one, it's based mostly on conjecture. um i understand there's a concern that sentencing, if you reform sentencing it won't be swift and severe. but uh, the way_ reforming and sentencing or changing to a mandatory minimum, really doesn't, doesn't massively increase whether it's swift and severe. it only shifts discretion from judges to prosecutors. it's just a shift, of that discretion while the prosecutor determines whether or not you'll, implement or how you'll, what you'll do with the law or the sentence and so i'm not sure that, the mandatory minimum, gets all, gets all these great benefits of being swift and severe and l- and, like we said before there's not much of e- evidence of de- of declining of a massive drop in drug use. there might be a, decrease in crime rate but that's not the same thing as the decrease in drug use which is what the war on drugs is supposed to produce. and we haven't seen, that, decline which i think also, takes away one of the main reasons why you want to immediately lock, um everybody up for, drug use. um, does anybody have anything they want to say about that? um i was just, going to, jump on what you said before about the prosecution. um they do have a big hand in punishment and that, has been often pointed to as part of the reason for racial disparity because they do have, a certain amount of, um, authority to determine whether or not someone's charged on the state or federal level, um whether they get charged with, dealing versus possession obviously dealing, being a more, stringently punished, crime. u- to go to um some of the points that, were made on this side as well uh i agree with you that we should punish, equally. tha- that was a point that, both Justin and, Holly? made earlier. but, the point is that currently we aren't punishing equally. currently, fifteen percent of cocaine users are African-American but, as i said before ni- they are ninety-percent of those who are convicted on crack cocaine charges, and forty percent of those who are, con- convicted for powder cocaine charges. um i think, as it's been pointed out previously, it is more difficult, to um sort of, round up those white suburban kids because they have a lot of, they don't have to deal on the corner they can deal in their houses. but, until we are, targeting them just as much as we're targeting these poorer communities there will continue to be a disparity. that point that also hasn't been raised which i think, definitely um goes into this is the whole idea of, um, in terms of, cops and who they pull over there's definitely been a huge debate in the past, in really recent times about whether or not, you know using racial, um criteria can be a reason for pulling people over. and it is been shown to be something that, even though it might not be mandated by, or allowed by different police forces it's certainly one of the criteria that they use for who they pull over. um that's definitely worth keeping in mind, so, Jim? yeah, i i have a couple of points to make about, sentencing imprisonment. um, you guys use a lot of correlational, research um, in your arguments and i'd i- i'd like to question that um, one of the things i'd like to question is, you talked about how, uh crime rates are at, an all-time low right now, um while, rates of imprisonment are at an all-time high. therefore putting people in prison is reducing crime. well um i read the paper the other day and read that um, uh unemployment is at is at a thirty year low right now so, perhaps one of the reasons that crime is at, is an all-time low is that employment is an all-time low. we need to start looking, um at some of the other causes uh potential causes of crime such as economic situations and i think, that's doubly so when you look at some of the communities, um that are so affected by crime and, specifically crack cocaine since we've been, we've been talking a lot about that. um, what is it in these communities that are, that are causing a lot of people to turn to the crack, trade, for their source of income? um and what's causing a lot of people, who are so um, uh who're having such a, a tough time to turn to crack for, some kind of enjoyment? um so, you know, i think we need to consider those, those situations. we need to consider the context. um and we need to look beyond simple like one-on-one correlations to explain, um why crime has gone down. um furthermore i, i guess i'd just like to add, there is a lot of research that shows that if you put someone in, uh prison in one of these communities someone will take his place. um, you know why is that? why is there why is there a constant demand for people to, to deal drugs in these communities? and, um, and i i think we need to look at, contextual factors to determine that, so. um, i just wanted to, i was talking a little bit about treatment and sort of the, the risk of uncertain success and whether or not drug treatment is an effective strategy and um, let me, well let me, first begin by saying that, w- there are some s- it is uncertain whether or not the war on the drugs is an effective strategy as well. uh the war on drugs like we've talked about before, hasn't really decreased, hasn't decreased drug use, and, has put a lot of people in prison. we have certain, racial impacts so i think that those are important, to look at. certain, disenfranchisement of, of a of one group, proportionately and the second thing is that we do, agree, i guess concede that treatment, in s- a treatment is, yo- you know, there's some cert- some levels that make it effective some levels that don't make it effective i think we talked about some of those before. the reason why treatment might be   okay. great. great. that was very good. you know, on both sides i think. um. i thought that was, for both, good presentations. um why don't uh we, why don't we take a couple of questions before we take a break, then we'll take some more, but just to get started off right now. um, questions that folks from the audience have? i- i- i- i i try to explain how, um, maybe other perspective because, i am from America. and and and uh uh uh i- i don't, i no from America. mhm mhm really? (xx) yeah? dead? mhm so you're suggesting that you didn't want to be on this side of the debate.   come on over to the WEED side (xx)  you know. like, what do you think should be different?  uh uh oh, okay.  mhm hm mhm   that's great. and now, um, i want you to go back to being a Sentencing Commission Member appointed by George Bush. yeah, come back. firmly in favor of strict and serious actions. uh does the audience have any questions they want to ask either of the teams? yeah, Harry? um, i guess i would address this mostly to the JAIL group. um and, reflecting on a lot of what uh Tonery said about this being part of a a wider political situation. why in the universe of things that you could address, as a social policy issue, in order to get at crime, would you target crack? i read a statistic that, eighty percent of the people who commit crimes are under the influence of alcohol by the legal standard. um, it seems to me that there's, there's a lot behind the fact that crack is singled out as something to be addressed, that has to do with demonizing poor minorities. so, could you react to that...? well, you know i'll start i mean, uh, i mean alcohol is legal, for starters. so, um, i mean i i don't know that we could really target alcohol per se. i wanna comment. just going back to, the_ how alcohol eighty percent of, violence. there are those, who, what was the statistic? i'm sorry. eighty percent of those who commit crimes are beyond the legal, limit for intoxication of alcohol. okay. um, i think that just, i think that that is a very serious, the implications of that are very serious and that is a problem that needs to be addressed. having said that, i think that we also cannot ignore, the problems associated with crack and, the violence associated with it. uh, i read in one of the articles that, um crack is associated with crime relating to its marketing and distribution more so than powder, and it gives four reasons. it, because of competing dealers, because of volatile dealing areas. crack dealers are more likely, to carry weapons and they're more likely to have an extensive record. to have committed a lot of other crimes and a lot of other violent crimes. it is a problem and just because alcohol is a problem doesn't mean that we should ignore, crack. we have to target both of them. and alcohol is a legal substance that we are legally allowed to use. because crack is illegal it contributes more to, the, crimes associated with the, um, i can't (xx) at this point can we colloquy, or? sure. um... what i'd like to ask about is the is the  well um, first of all, like like i was saying before, if you wanna look at simply the particular crimes being committed that's great for that individual crime. you know that that's, perfectly fair, that's fantastic. but, the market, as a whole, the crack market, has specific, public health and violence and crime issues associated with it, that aren't present in other markets. we wanna squash the market. we wanna make the opportunity cost of dealing crack so high, that the market is not there anymore. now, that doesn't exist with any other drug, at this point. those sort of uh, you know, the market factors, uh that Holly mentioned, that um, you know have to do with its marketability, you know the types of things that we talked about that certainly doesn't exist, you know at the corner liquor store. it doesn't exist in the powder cocaine trade it doesn't exist in the marijuana trade it doesn't exist in the heroin trade. um, and so, you know maybe for each individual crime that approach's acceptable. but there are other issues here, that aren't addressed by that type of approach. and, you know i think that, you know, we ascribe more blame to cocaine because of the problems associated with its marketing. with i- associated with um its methods of distribution and that don't exist for other drugs. and that's why i think it's justified. i just wanna add one last thing and it's a quote from the U-S Sentencing Commission. they say, can i comment? sure. okay. um, uh, well, i just wanna com- i just wanna just sort of talk a little bit about how that statute has been implemented. i think that sort of, well, i'll just, give you some statistics about how the statute's been implemented. i think we sort of, talked about how if you have this really harsh penalty then that means you break down all the distribution networks for crack and that's not what's happened. um, only five percent of the people that we have arrested, for crack are high level crack dealers. people who are the high level crack dealers are smart, and what they do is they have their young kids, or they, their mules, um, that's what, that's just the term. young kids people on the street corners carry the large amount of crack. you're not punished, uh, under the law because, you're punished for how much of it you have on your person. and so you get your younger kids you have your women your low level dealers carrying all the crack. they're the people who get busted for having fifty-five or fifty grams of crack and that's why, uh seventeen percent of people, who are in federal prison for dr- for drug offense related to cocaine had no prior violent history. and fifty-five percent are only low level relationship to the crack trade. and that means that our laws, uh it sounds nice, but our laws, we, that people who deal crack have found a way to get around the laws. and we don't have high level crack dealers, in jail. that's not what's happening whatsoever. and so i i think that if we looked at severity, if that was maybe part of something, when we determine sentencing, we might be able to target, getting, we might be able to target people who committed more severe offenses and get them in to ja- jail and prison, at a rate that, made more sense than the people that we have currently behind bars, for our crack offenses.   oh no, that's alright go ahead. okay. i i'll just i'll just say pretty briefly. um, common sense would dictate if you wanna solve a problem, you have to find the the root cause, of the problem. um, if we have, if if crack is, if crack is an epidemic in poor black communities, you know why is that? what's the cause? is the cause that poor blacks are genetically predisposed to doing crack or that there's, if they have some, if there's some kind of moral deficiency? i mean i would, i would argue that's not the case. if if you eliminate those, as the causes, then you have to look at the environment. something in the environment is causing, poor blacks to, engage in drug trafficking, or e- e- e- engage in in crack trafficking, or use crack. and, if you really wanna solve the problem of crack, since that's what it, that's what the concern is then, shouldn't we look at those, factors? um, actually Holly mentioned earlier when, you uh, were talking about children using, drugs, um, that, wouldn't it be better to have kids involved in positive things? that's one of the things that we're advocating by, shifting towards um, decreasing the demand. we're advocating programs for children we're advocating educational programs, alternatives to drug use like recreational programs after school, more jobs, for these high school age kids who, um you are so concerned about, being heavy drug users. um, if there are no objections, i think we should take a quick break here. and then come back and continue the discussion of, what you wanna say. i i mean you guys got, you know you know, barraged by attacks here if you wanna respond briefly that's fine, or if you wanna take a pause. well, i w- i would just say that, statistics can be used to show anything. that's very helpful Justin. position. the basic, argument will be, prisons invest human resources and rehabilitation programs. um, in- in- so actually to say that, not only, you know, has this, been (xx) uh, and talk about why it's ineffective why it's unjust and why it's unfair to provide lots of programs. um and then go on to say what makes it hardest about a lot of programs. what, other important goals of running a prison might get undermined if you, spend too m- pay too much attention to programs and what things a prison should be doing instead... um, so i mean a- and again i i only mean those as general guidelines. um, i hope that will help (xx) if you guys have any suggestions i'm, happy to,  i'm not gonna take on the role of prison management but, i can't imagine arguing that, rehabilitation is unjust. mhm. yeah?    and they yeah i think it's a pretty good way to break it down. i think it that's a pretty real. uhuh  and politicians, there's definitely been a lot of debate, mhm yeah, nah, i think it would a, a decided minority (xx) no, (xx) state legislature. (xx) yeah. that that's probably a good way to do it. um, and then, mhm um, i was just gonna put you guys in whatever i have you here. um which means Cathy Holly and Harry on one team, Ally Susan and Jill are on the other. and who wants to call the, call the uh, pro treatment side. if you call it right you get pro treatment. tails. okay... tails it is. now you're the pro team. pro treatment. i want    alright um, oh do we have somebody out making, quiz notes? le- let's regroup and they can come back in um, am i supposed to go back over there? yeah. alright. let's, regroup and uh, close that all the way. and and take some more, questions from the audience, about, drugs. why do you think they call it dope? yeah uh, i well i heard uh, WEED, um rattle off the statistic about ninety-three percent of federal dollars are going toward supply-side strategies while only seven percent are going towards demand-side strategies. and i agreed with uh, Justin's contention about that, that about the fact that, you know um, i- it's very hard to prove kind of causal relationship b- between, um some of the prevention education and and uh treatment, measures that would go with the demand-side strategy, and, you know measurable, uh, measurable, effects and and less drug use. um, but at the same time i didn't hear kind of a, an alternative proposal um, from the JAIL side. are are you guys? you know, they_ the WEED had mentioned they wanted a fifty-fifty kind of, um budgetings, budgeting between the supply and the demand. are you, i guess, are you are you proposing to keep kind of a status quo with a ninety-three percent and a seven percent or, are you completely giving up, even though even though you can't, you can't, um, you know measure, you can't demonstrate a causal relationship, uh for some dema- demand side strategies. are you completely giving up on these types of strategies or would you propose an increase in funding, or would you_ do you want the ninety-three seven kind of, ratio to stand or what? i i'd like to respond to that actually uh, the statistic that i was working from was a seventy thirty split. okay. um, okay. is- i'm just, is is there, is there a point at which, you know you've been talking about the fact that we need the supply strid- supply-side strategies to get the people off the streets to get them in jail you know. that crime crime has been going down because of, uh um the sentencing policies that you guys are propounding and, and stuff. but is there a point at which that that funding will change? i mean there's only, there are only so many people off the str- i mean, by your theory we will get all the people off the streets and that's our priority and we get the crack out of people's hands. but don't we hafta at some point change kind of funding priorities to prevention? you know once we've got these people off shouldn't there_ i- is there going to be a change in the funding? is, or is this going to stay seventy-thirty or? i think part of the thirty does go to treatment. but i also think that private organization should, be the one to provide a lot of the treatment um, i think that the ment- mental health care industry in general, in the United States today is, a large chunk of it is privately funded. and i think that corporations do a better job than the government of, providing drug treatment. yeah, i'd like to say a couple things on that. um, uh for starters you know i'm not necessarily opposed to more treatment programs but i don't, want to cut into the law enforcement, budget. i don't wanna lessen that i don't wanna lessen the penalties i think that's a, a key, component. like, i don't i don't i don't think it's right to keep the amount of funding for this progra- this problem the same and shift, some of it to treatment. if you want_ you know i'm sure there's some environmental programs or something we can cut, to give more treatment alright. one point. David Crosby, uh. Stills and Nash i had a question about the fifty-fifty split of resources. now, i think it was Missy who said that the one hundred and one ratio for crack and powder cocaine is, is not backed up by studies it's an arbitrary number. fifty-fifty also seems to me kind of an arbitrary crowd pleasing, number. uh, and i was wondering, wh- how do you arrive at it? and uh, whether it really reflects, how much it cost to do, a treatment program versus how much it cost to, to run an enforcement program. oh well. co- the cost of, doing a treatment program like the most expensive treatment programs that we have cost about sixty-eight, they range, it ranges from eighteen hundred, to sixty-eight hundred dollars a year. in contrast the cost of putting someone in prison for a year is about twenty-five thousand dollars. so i mean the cost is much, less, for a treatment program. fifty-fifty is that, a lot of, lot of some, certain public policy institutes, like the RAND, corporation have done studies trying to look at a balanced approach. and balanced, get_ they used fifty-fifty, as the balance. and that's sorta so where took the, fifty-fifty balanced idea. i guess it is sort of crowd pleasing cuz it's, you know like even, but and they tried to look at an id- of an idea where you had treatment, adequate amounts of treatment and some changes to treatment, which i, we really haven't talked about but, some changes to treatment and uh, had the law, enforcement. and then they did i mean, a lot of what we're talking about does come from their studies about the cost, and about the, effectiveness and they concede, you know, some problems with the effectiveness but they think that it's a much much better solution than, law enforcement. so that's where we got fifty-fifty. but what does it mean if it doesn't mean that, you said there's a high, high price for putting somebody in jail as for your low price program. it doesn't mean have, ten programs for every person in jail so it's balanced out. oh oh, are you saying like, does it mean fifty-fifty in terms of dollars or does it mean fifty-fifty in how far the dollars go? is that the question? i i'd like to know what it means (that's it.) i mean i- i think that fifty-fifty means in terms of the money, spent. half the money is spent, on treatment, half the money is spent, on, law enforcement. maybe the half that's spent on treatment goes, a lot farther. uh, you get more bang for your buck in that fifty than you get in the other fifty. but, it means, a split of the, the federal money. they would spend half and half. but how does that make sense given that law enforcement is so much more expensive, than social programs? because i, their argument is law enforcement doesn't, law_ yeah it's more expensive, law enforcement doesn't work and produces worse, results so, it's fine i- i mean, it's better to spend less money on it, and you get more effective spending when you spend on, decreasing the amount that people, uh use when do prevention. basically reducing the amount of people who would be involved in trade or in possession. and i think that that's, where they're coming from, when they... i can speak to that a little bit as well. a lot of the, the mayors who have looked at addressing, um sort of, drug problems within their own cities, have looked at Baltimore as um, good example of that. have looked at increasing availability, of drug treatment programs. um the mayor of Baltimore argues that, unless every person who, um, wants drug treatment has it available to them like on demand. because um, of the way that drugs cycle. you may want, drug treatment real bad when you're o- in withdrawal but by the time you score your next hit you're not particularly interested, in receiving treatment at that point. unless it's available, on demand for people, that, its ability to actually help people is much reduced. and in order to make it available, on demand for people there has to be a huge increase in expenditure in that particular area. okay. any more from the audience right now or, Leslie did you have a, question? yeah i have a question for JAIL. i just want to know if, if the, um, harsher penalties were meant to have like a deterrent effect in themselves. cuz they mentioned deter people from using drugs people from selling drugs or both, and how effective do you think that would be? um, you mean the mandatory minimums? yeah if i could follow up on that. um, the... uh, we made you know a very strong argument that there is not much evidence that there has been any sort of public safety benefit, whether it's from deterrence or from, incapacitation and, you know, though the person locked up, uh can't commit a crime we all know that, uh uh, that somebody will take, his or her place out in the world and and and cause the same, level of mayhem that that that the person locked up would've caused. um, and so they've provided all this evidence that suggests that whatever the mechanisms that these public safety benefits aren't materializing. that, um, if the risk had been higher the cost of coc- of crack would've gone, uh, up but in fact it went down. that if uh, arrests stopped crime the streets would be_ you know we're arresting at you know, at enormous rates and we would've cleared the streets of a lot of these dealers, and that's doesn't seem to be happening. um, uh uh, and you know, and and you know Jim made some some points about you know your large argument about, uh you know about, uh you know that crime rates, um have gone down as incapacitation, has gone up isn't really valid, because you know, the gross national product hasn't gone up while the number of pet hamsters in Nevada has has gone up and so you know well, mhm, so, even if they don't necessarily have public safety benefits that  mhm um, a- as an aside the_ i don't know if anybody else noticed this, but Tonery's argument, he's the one who mentioned this thing about, you know crack prices went down when they should've gone up if the drug was working. but then later on he talks about for other reasons the proportion of the population that was using drugs went down. well, those for other reasons should also the cause the price of crack to go down. and so, even the drug war was increasing the price, then that effect would not necessarily be that it would go up. i mean the drug mor- war may have kept the price from falling   there, there was something else from Tonery that i thought was contradictory. i think it had to do with uh, i i i'd have to look, you know to the book but i think it had to do with uh, the people who were um, that people should've known that you know, more blacks would be convicted but then he starts talking about, i thought he said something else that contradicted that. i don't i'd have to look at it. mhm. they all contradict, DiIulio contradicted himself too.  Nixon i mean i guess that, maybe that will keep happening for a while but it has to peak at some point, and then start going back down i think that, our ultimate goal is we have decided as a society that drugs are illegal because they're bad, drugs in general. all drugs. and until, we either decide that drugs are not necessarily bad, or, that, it's not an interest, it's not important to society, to, prevent the use of them, the drug war will continue. and i guess that's a good thing. because it will make, our streets safer um, it'll make our people healthier, we'll have more, well, we can have, i mean the society can think drugs are bad, and we don't have to fight a war on them. i mean there's other ways to kind of prevent them there's other ways to address the issue,  but at what point would you lift martial law is maybe the question  i i don't know that there is a point, that we should lift martial law. i think that these   okay. that's interesting.  uh, well i guess i i you can, i i thought that Ally might wanna...   um, well i, i think that part of the reason why it's questionable, is that, um, we were talking before, they mention that, obviously drug u- use of this drug doesn't occur just in the black community. um whereas in the case of, perhaps racketeering and Sicilians, there was, um a direct correlation i mean definitely the who- the idea that um, that a particular law can keep everyone from doing something, like sure that's definitely constitutional and in theory, the law is constitutional but in practice that's that's what we're concerned about is the way that it's actually, um, sort of, doled out, and that that partic- that is the part that's inequitable. mhm. did you wanna  mhm mhm, well that's a, interesting argument but probably not very popular on the hal- floors of Congress these days but um, uh, but one follow up to that um, i mean you guys suggest i think it was Missy who in her talk, suggested that you could capture some of these additional harms that you concede are associated with crack, through the use of guidelines that say, you know if the person who is, dealing you know either in coke or crack has uh you know weapons on them or is uh involving, uh youth in the distribution of their drugs or, all the other you know thirteen or so things that, uh were in your list, that you could make guidelines that would capture those harms and make, larger sentences for them and not directly ask you know what form of cocaine are we talking about here? but those guidelines would still, probably have this disproportionate racial impact so why would they be any more just than, than uh, than the straight differential between crack and cocaine. well i think that that, i was waiting for someone to say that, um i think that uh, i think that though that that underestimates the way that the sentencing laws are enforced now. mhm mhm mhm mhm, that's sure responsive. other questions Harry? DiIulio points out that most of the crimes, committed around the drug trade are committed against people, um, who are minorities. so, um, how would particularly the WEED group balance the, the bord- the burden of enforcement which is disproportionate, on these communities um, with the need to, um, in order to be fair in terms of e- equal protection of the laws to be there and to fight the crime so that, economic demon- development can come in? well, um, i can speak to that a (xx) yeah, i'd i'd just like to add to that i think that, i think that if you ask members of these of um, of these communities, would you rather, have us protect you by helicopters constantly flying over your neighborhood and, a police person you know a police officer on every corner or, would you rather have, you know, near your neighborhood and accessible to your neighborhood jobs that pay a living wage, um and schools that aren't dilapidated, and, um, (i thought the same) community i was gonna say the same thing. it also, kind of assumes that treatment doesn't do anything to lessen those problems. and i think that, we think that, it probably would. i mean if you, get, have less addicts, you d- decrease the demand for drugs, you do decrease, the cri- some of the crime and some of the problems involved with drugs, and so i think that, that i should tack that on. (beautiful.) um, i gotta a couple points i wanted to, talk, lob over in your direction. alright. do you guys wanna, respond? okay. well, that, that very well may be true, but, i think you can't make an argument that no, whites use crack cocaine. however um, there has been no white person ever, who's been convicted of a crack offense in Boston, Denver, Chicago, L-A, Dallas, Miami and numerous other cities. kinda kinda lob that one back to you. hot potato  right. well we, i don't think that we originally said that the laws instituted were bad i mean clearly, as you've already pointed out, they've been declared constitutional. again what we're concerned about is the way that they're implemented and we've said that, previously and i think this is a clear example the, the fact that there have been absolutely, zero, um convictions of whites for crack offenses in in any of_ those are major U-S cities yeah. i think therefore we need to  yeah but i ki- i kinda think two things about that, i think first, you have to look at the reason, why you target, why crack is targeted and if there is a motivation behi- and obviously i mean the result when you target the crack market is that you target, African-Americans with less money and there, there might be something behind the original motivation behind why you decided to target, you've kinda gotta examine that. second thing, is that i think that, and you kinda, i mentioned i think that cra- that_ i don't know if i agree, that, the only segments of communities of, of the African-American community affected by the drug war are hard core drug users i don't know if that like, that you just said a minute ago i don't if i agree with that, i think that it's broader, and i think it has affected, i think it has affected, a lot of lives, that were people who, weren't hard core crack users. and i i just i i'm not sure that i, a hundred percent agree that it's as targeted it's as direct as  yeah but i mean, i do think, i mean i think about fifteen minutes ago, we talked we had a long discussion about black on black crime and how we think that that, relates back to whether or not there should be, whether or not that justifies the war on drugs. i mean, yeah there's, there, like i think that that Ally said, there originally might have been a high level of support and that high level of support has really eroded after, you know communities are really trying to balance, a lot of these issues. Leslie did you have a follow-up on this point? you had your hand up earlier. i just, i had wanted to say something about the quote that Justin read which i think is a little bit misleading in, in portraying how many um, that are arrests that actually use drugs and trade because, a lot of dealers have to like i guess like you were talking about earlier, how they transform the powder into the rock cocaine and a lot of dealers, that sell crack cocaine have to go through that process and in that process, um, of i guess they call it cooking crack or whatever they do, um, the potency of crack cocaine is that it gets into your system just as if you were using it but a lot of them don't actually use it it's just in their system because, as a dealer or whatever they have to go through that process and that, so i don't know (just get tested as kinda) mhm. so that some of the people that s- purportedly have it in them they weren't actually using it but, it doesn't exactly paint a picture that they're not culpable, i mean they were cooking it and, uh, i, well, i don't think that_ mhm so, you might withdraw those other statements about why crack is more dangerous in favor of this more modest list. well, i i think it's certainly, um, i think it's more dangerous for all those reasons. uh, you know i, but i think that sentencing guidelines alone don't take everything into account, mhm mhm mhm mhm, well, i mean how does WEED respond to that i mean you seem to wanna go back to a sorta one-to-one ratio for crack versus cro- cocaine penalties that, the same amount of either drug would trigger the same penalty, um, but doesn't that neglect some of these, these these things that aren't captured by your guidelines the way Justin points out. it neglects the increased addictiveness, it uh, neglects the fact that it's a drug designed to appeal to you know the poor and vulnerable because it's, you know marketed in these little vials and, it, would it- a- does the does the one-to-one ratio do justice to the differential harms associated with crack? right. i'm, i'm not a hundred percent sure it's a one_ i mean there are, there are the other, facts. i'm not sure it's a hundred, a one-to-one ratio. you might understand it better than i do, so maybe it is one-to-one ratio.    okay but, um well, um, in terms of whether or not, whether or not, they're, it's more addictive or etcetera, etcetera. i mean it, what, the Commission basically said was that there weren't very good, pharmacological studies that could prove whether or not, uh, crack or cocaine was more addictive what you could prove, was that crack has a more intense high, even though cocaine had a high which lasted longer. so, shorter more intense crack, longer lasting with cocaine they had really a lot of, ran into a, difficulties in sort of determining well okay, what does, what does that, mean? um, in fact a, in fact a lot and throughout a lot of their recommendations, they just kept finding they didn't have any studies, to prove, crack or cocaine were different for any of these things. that there was no study that proved the difference between how much crime you commit with crack or cocaine, no study that proved, b- big differences in death no study that proved that in in some some were so s- ridiculous that they were finding like three studies across the entire country, that looked at, crack and cocaine and how much more crime you committed. you know, they they only had three that surveyed like seven hundred they had nothing to base these_ and i think that their feeling was a lot of this seems to thus be, created on, conjecture. the idea that we think, we have this gut feeling that crack, is worse. and that since we can't prove it through any  so this sort of residual, differential harms that Justin mentioned you think that there's not enough evidence that  mhm  uh you want a quick rebuttal  right  well we'll come back to that in just a second. well, yeah, we'll come back to that well it seems like that's, that's a fair argument as far as sentencing policies for users, um, but as far as sentencing policies for, sellers and guys who cook this stuff up, i think the fact that, i think Justin's and JAIL's point um, i- is pretty well taken the fact that, um, when you convert cocaine into crack form it's more easily accep- accessible, i- it's easier to sell and um, basically it's easier acces- i i- it's more easily accessible to, uh poor people and and younger people, and and i think that's, that's a real problem and the- that's a problem of prevention as well if we're talking about prevention, um so, what would you say about different sentencing policies as far as, as far as um, sellers go? we- well i think that in those thirteen guidelines, i didn't read them all. but, they are like, some of them are like, wer- like, they address those concerns, who, who was targeted, i can, even i can find them, i don't know where they are, but. but i mean those would be different between coc- you you would, say that those should be different between cocaine and crack then right? i mean the- they use, y- i mean, it's since i mean my guess is since those are things that say would be, that you determine to increase the severity, and if those happen more like, more readily in a crack trade then yeah, it would cause a distinction between crack and cocaine. okay so there should be i mean there should be a difference between how we treat, cocaine and crack as far as selling  right i just wanted to point out real quick that the, the thirty- thirty-six states don't use the hundred-to-one ratio. and, don't necessarily apply the mandatory minimums and do, a- a- allow discretion, in their cases. yeah, is that is that the loophole thing that they they were talking, talking about in the what we're debating here is all, everybody understands this is all  w- there's also, and i mean i also know that in nineteen ninety-four, there was a federal, they tried to institute a federal, loophole. to try to make, to try to, lessen. although, the only, only, i think it was something like, thirty people have had their sentences lessened, so that the loophole doesn't really get used ever. um, i i had one more, uh, question for JAIL and i wanna, wrap up unless people have some burning, questions. i i don't think we've covered this one yet, there was a discussion in, uh the report by the Sentencing Commission of of what, seemed to me a a pretty, serious disparity and it was the disparity between, um, the sentence that the the the guy with, the cocaine that distributes it to people who make crack, what sentence that person gets versus what sentence all the people to whom he distributed. and so you could have somebody who had four hundred grams of cocaine, uh, and distributed it to you know fifty different crack dealers and those crack dealers would all get five years in jail, and the cocaine dealer would not, because he hasn't reached that mandatory minimum. doesn't this strike you as unequitable, unjust? i mean, that this is clearly where the, the person high up on the distribution chain is getting off, um, and the people much closer to the street are not getting off just because, by virtue of being at the l- at the retail level, they need to uh you know they have to convert it into crack and so they have the harsher punishments.  well i'll, i'll start us off i guess um, you know i, my, my feeling on that is that, the f- the the distributor is high up on the powder cocaine, tree. whereas the retailers are a- actually the people who've, taken the extra tre- step, converted that cocaine into crack cocaine. um they are the ones who, took that step and are now selling and distributing a more dangerous drug okay but those people, you know the  mhm mhm but couldn't you look at it the other way the, the distributor with the cocaine did not take the step because they knew this issue of punishment, they kn- they they_ in their heads they are in the crack business but, they're not gonna convert it into crack until the last minute, uh because they know the punishments are more severe. right. if the other, if the people who do convert it, don't wanna get caught, if they see that what the penalties are then they don't have to they can wait, they can buy it in powder form take it home to their kitchen add some baking soda, some water and microwave it and then they won't be caught either, they'll it'll you know? mhm,  mhm right, my opinion, yeah, we should  mhm i find this a tough one to answer, good, good job trying.   twenty-to-one ratio. some kind of compromise, yeah yeah and uh, what was especially interesting is they, uh so they they tr- wanted to raise the, the leve- the amount that would trigger a mandatory minimum for crack, and so it was from, now it's at five uh grams and it became, their recommendation was between i think twenty-five and seventy-five grams. and they lowered, the amount for cocaine it's now at five hundred grams, and they r- they recommended that it be between i think a hundred and, twenty-five and two hundred and twenty-five something like that. so they brought the ratio closer together by both, being softer on crack and being harder on cocaine to try to, i guess diffuse that argument. um, was that the original approach as well? like when they, their first proposal, when they  yeah. mhm if they accepted it they'd be soft on drugs. yeah, i mean it's a, were they always, were they always harder on drugs every time, or? yeah they i mean they were, pretty hard on drugs i think, um, i mean it was always increased sentencing kind of, yeah i'm not m- yeah i'm not sure if they'd ever tried to, lower a penalty before yeah right. okay. i think most of it kinda came out in the discussion. yeah, i think. a- all the issues that i, that i remembered from the reading. okay. i mean the- ther- there was, i mean yeah the big, you know, the big issues had to do with this idea of you know, harm. i mean the idea that cocaine has more, harmful effects than than other drugs and_ i'm sorry crack does and that's why it's punished more severely, but then the question is uh, do, are there other ways of getting at that that um, you know, that don't have all the other costs that we talked about. yeah Justin? yeah, just the one s- reading, that i thought, were, well the Body Count, the stuff from body count. like about how like everybody is going to prison or like, really serious violent offenders who, you know you've got those horror stories interspersed throughout, i just thought it was, it's interesting i wondered how, cuz you know they talk about prior conviction, sometimes they say specifically violent offenses but it's not always clear what the prior convictions were. mhm mhm yeah yeah. yeah, and h- William Bennett you know who, he is? do people know who, William Bennett is? he was the, he's very you know sort of, intellectual conservative figure who um was, i guess education secretary under, mhm mhm wasn't, wasn't that article significantly older than a lot of the other ones? i mean that was the thing that i, sort of questioned cuz it was like from nineteen seventy-six. oh no the Bennett one? yeah that  was it? okay. okay, cuz  mhm right yeah, yeah, i mean i thought they're, i mean, you know they make some some, i mean they have a uh, i think a uh, i think a perspective that's important to think about, but that they're a little sloppier than some of 'em um i thought um, like the, you know the contradiction the main contradiction i saw in there is first they're saying how, we're not punitive these days, um, and our evidence of this is that the ratio of, uh, people in priso- people incarcerated to uh, crimes committed is very very low. um, but then later on they go on to say, how uh, uh, you know each criminal commits dozens of crimes, well then the the the, i mean you have to factor that into the ratio of crimes to criminal because crimes isn't the number, isn't the relevant denominator. the number of criminals is the relevant denominator, and you have to divide the number of crimes by, the rate of criminality, so that i mean i'm being a little bit babbling here but i think you get the general, sort of point that they were a little bit inconsistent um, uh, in along that dimension but anyway. but the argument that, um you know, people who are in jail for drugs are not in fact, you know, as they put it, you know misplaced angels this has been a powerful and important argument in these debates, so anyhow. uh, di- did people like reading through the the the Sentencing Commission's stuff? interesting i was gonna make a real quick announcement. mkay A-B-C yeah. this was last night on? mhm. yeah, i know, i just i know that i, taped something last Tuesday, and i accidently ran the tape like through Nightline, which was about like man- minimums, yeah mhm so they might be doing a theme thing, so keep your eyes open. but it was a really very interesting, cuz it kinda put a, human face on all the stuff we're talking about. i think it was actually huh  (xx) like when we were i was doing research to this last night, there's this totally interesting website i don't know if any of you would be interested in it but i was, and i don't remember the thing but i could email it to you guys but that, was basically just every woman who's incarcerated in a federal prison for a drug offense it was like just a picture and sort of a bio, of like every single woman and, i mean they were really fair like some of them were like and she's been arrested like eight times already right. huh, yeah interesting. yeah, i'll see if we can't, um, get a copy of those Nightlines. um, one quick announcement, there is, uh, i passed around this just uh, one sheet that has a sh- a very short article that's a little more positive about rehabilitation for next week, uh together with a table from something that was released, that describes how much different regions of the country spend on uh, treatment versus other things, so pick a copy up. i think it would be interesting, um, like, when you do this class next,  mhm  yeah. mhm mhm  uhuh uhuh okay uhuh uhuh yeah, that's a ide- cuz uh wi- the stuff that we did on rehabilitation when it lumps everything together that's a little bit unfair to the drug treatment stuff because it tends to work better than, the sort of behavior (xx) mhm  mhm yeah but no, it it's true that drug treatment is, people are less, cynical about than, than other types of rehabilitation, yeah. no no no, i was seeing if it was a Gore or a Bradley, or a Bush, cuz i know you. don't say that too loud. what, Bush? Bush. i hope, i was hoping to share a comment. i was hoping that your comment that, you know we should look at historical injustice to determine, like whether or not a  no, but that's not what well, but it's funny. i mean if   i don't think there should be special treatment.    well, yeah. we have, well, i mean you wanna chat briefly now. yeah yeah, if it's working?  i think so. um i'm, what what was the? mhm mhm so Native Americans cannot  mhm mhm mhm mhm uhuh mhm mhm mhm uhuh uhuh mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah, no that i mean that sounds that sounds good. it could be, i mean there's there's some big issues there about um you know, the, the, how, sovereign a nation an Indian nation really is, right yeah. except for i think that, yeah, it's pro- i just think that there's a lot of, there's huge fear mhm  yeah, uhuh uhuh yeah. so, that would be interesting and to frame it the way you framed it at the beginning. yeah that's what i wa- right because i know that they like in, in like South Dakota and Florida, they've done it like two different ways and i actually, mhm mhm mhm nah, that sounds that sounds really good, that sounds really interesting, just do it as a you know, what do you think what is the right way to go about it. it, it's  mhm uhuh yeah, i guess the hard thing will be to, to separate out the specifically criminal justice issues from the much more anticriminal issues of, of the sovereignty, you know sovereignty of the (xx) nation um, but i don't mean, don't don't go into them and (xx) and then it gets, interesting (xx) 	1
LES355SU009.json	okay let's begin. uh, any questions on the last class or anything on the readings or anything we've been doing? this will probably be one of the last sessions on the Romance languages i may need a bit of time Thursday, but after that we'll sorta look at the parallel case, dealing with English. so, the next thing that you should be reading in the coursepack are the series of articles in the coursepack, that deal with the history of the English language again those form just general background. just some of the things i want to say i mean as i said the lectures themselves, will not be based you know specifically on those readings although i certainly will attempt to answer questions, or anything specific you may have, uh with regard to that okay? all right what i wanted t- yeah? do you want me to read this little thing? okay go ahead. okay. um just part of procedure, I'm supposed to do it. um, are you gonna, um this is gonna be, transcribed like written down? or  right. it's, play- well we hope to have it both available in the the form of a transcription, um, like somebody can read out on a piece of paper and also as a a digital, digitized, computer so see for someone like me who does language history i wish that they'd done this a thousand years ago so i could have recordings, of what Spanish sounded like a thousand years ago. very nice. any questions? okay thanks. okay. all righty um what i want to do is continue with this discussion that we've been trying to show, between the interaction of history and, language change, and again as i state we're using the Romance languages as sort of our test case, because we have an abundant documentation of the situation both of the historical development of the Romance languages the historical background of real world events which occurred from the start of the Roman Empire right up through the fall of the Roman Empire, and the ultimate uh fate of the various provinces of the Roman Empire, and we also have an abundant corpus of linguistic documentation. so to a large extent the Romance languages present an ideal case, uh for studying, the development of language against the background of history. or conversely how history affects language. one of the issues that i want to particularly concentrate on today is the issue of the linguistic, uh impact of language contact. one of the main historical themes that i've been stressing, throughout the last uh couple of classes has been that in the history of th- in the linguistic history of the Roman Empire, we've had movements of peoples. we first of all have the expansion of the Romans. as the Romans left Rome and over the course of several centuries expanded their territorial domain, to what was to become the Roman Empire which at its height, stretched from Ireland all the way in uh through west bo- well most of uh central western and eastern Europe and through the Mediterranean basin both the north and the south shore the Mediterranean, and beyond into Asia Minor. other pe- movements of peoples that are also relevant will be we'll see a little later when the Roman Empire falls apart. and when various outside groups outside uh ethnic groups, uh invade or enter perhaps that would be the better word there really wasn't an invasion, in the strict organized military sense but when uh outside groups entered the Roman Empire, this also led to the movements of peoples, and who came into contact with the Romans so in both cases with these with the (j-) territorial expansion, of the Romans as they moved i- and expanded their empire and then with the, uh entry into the Roman Empire of other peoples, the result of this is language contact in other words Latin, comes into contact, is it still, in some parts of the world, a J sound? no. there is a J sound in some varieties of Spanish like the Argentine  what are you saying? /p/ to /k/? or /f/ to /k/? /f/ to /x/. and so you're saying that F is changing into... yeah well what i'm trying well yeah (xx) th- what happened is that in Castilian and only in Castilian, what was the /f/ in Latin, or what is believed to have been a /f/ in Latin, cuz i'm gonna have to sort of uh, nuance a little later something i'm saying, but what traditionally is believed to be an F sound in Latin a /f/ sound, in other words a labiodental fricative, as Castilian evolved, that /f/ became a /x/. alright? whereas in all the other varieties of Romance that didn't occur. how do you know that that's the case or that maybe they were using, um a letter which we used for something else to represent, the labiodental, fricative? because we have the living evidence of all the other Romance languages. moreover the fact the other point is cuz here i'm giving you just limited data, uh there are lots of exceptions to this rule. okay there are a numb- there, are a fair number of exceptions. okay? i'm afraid to really answer your question thoroughly i would have to go off on such a tangent, it would lead us much too far afield your question is perfectly legitimate and i don't want to give you the impression i'm just trying to deke it or duck it rather, so if you want to discuss it with me further i'd be more than happy but i don't want to take up class time with that okay? okay okay you use something else that, your native system does have that's similar. exactly you usually go until you a- until you actually start to master the language the the usual first reaction, is to use a s- a sound in your language that is somewhat similar in other words shares, some f- not all obviously but shares some of the phonetic features, associated with the sound that you're tr- uh you- associated with this strange sound. okay so of course obviously when, the Basques were learning Latin, in the days of the Roman Empire, the Romans did not have the goodness to organize schools and have Latin one-oh-one. followed by Latin one-oh-two etcetera. if in other words the Basques who were learning Latin who were learning it you know uh in the marketplace or on the streets or in the fields. uh, probably the best way to learn language. but probably not the best way to teach elegant grammar or elegant pronunciation. so according to the theory of Menendez Pidal the Basques didn't have a /f/ sound, but rather that the Basques, did have and this again can be documented on the basis of our reconstructions of Basque, uh that Basque certainly did have an H type sound... now, one might ask what in common is there between the phonetic features of a /f/, and the phonetic features of a /x/? what do they have in common? is this even a reasonable linguistic hypothesis? in other words we see according Menendez Pidal's hypothesis, by the way Menendez Pidal is the name of that great Spanish scholar don't worry who it is, uh, um his hypothesis was that uh a Basque trying to pronounce /p/ /b/ /p/ /b/, how many agree with that? any disagreements with that? fine it's quite correct now why would you say it's closer? yeah. labial right, they all the /p/ the /b/ and the /f/ all share, uh, all share the feat- the feature of labial or l- labiality in other words all of them involve in some way, in their articulation, the lips. alright the lips are, uh the lips come into play. so, therefore it would almost seem more logical, that if you're a speaker of Basque trying to learn, Latin, that if you're going to (ada-) uh you can't pronounce the F cuz you don't have it, and you instead of making the effort to learn it, and of course, that's one of the alternatives is just to learn the new sound after all, for those of you who have learned Spanish, as native speakers of English, you have, learned to with varying degrees of success perhaps to pronounce the sounds of that are the um, refresh my, my knowledge of, phonetics here, is it, is it always or most usually the case that, that, when you're talking about something being close to another one your your, emphasis is on, closeness or, relatedness in terms of proximity or does it ever have to do with both of them, having the same, production feature (or)  yes.   well the H and the F actually they're not i mean strictly speaking, the F and the H, uh the H is actually an aspirate it's really not a fricative.   y- (well) this presents a a general and much ki- and somewhat controversial issue of which are the most dominant features. okay? in other words the /p/ and the /b/, the /p/ shares the with /f/, th- uh the uh features the uh u- the features of voicelessness and of labiality. and also of physical proximity. alright? cuz again the physical proximity is not unimportant because the one thing that again the thing that stands out in this change and makes it sort of, strange in quotation marks, is the fact that you're going from a sound here that's labial I-E involving articulators that are in the front of the articulatory apparatus, to a /h/ which is articulated almost as far back as you can go, in the articulatory apparatus in other words you're you're traversing, the whole gamut. and even leads to the whole problem of, intermediate stages or whether it was just basically a leap, from the front to the back. alright? it looks painful (xx) you said the internal was the upper lower class? ye- well that's uh int- the internal actually would be the /f/ the phonetic nature of the F yes. yeah. not the fact that the sl- ea- the class distinction is actually an external feature. but the fact that is that internally, then you would've the starting point would've been this uh labio- would've been this bilabial fricative. by the way that w- that solution also presents a number of problems as well, i'm not necessarily advocating it, cuz you still have the interesting phenomenon that hasn't been (that) neither uh hypothesis explains, is how you get from a front sound to a back sound. why does it go from a /p/ to a /x/? one thing and here this might even be more of interest for those of you interested in more general phenomena of linguistic change, it's interesting tha- that the history of Spanish there are a number of changes that are unrelated to each other probably, in all likelihood they're unrelated but they do have the one thing in common. they represent uh a switch from sounds that were pronounced in the front of the mouth, toward the back of the mouth. in other words that in the history of the Spanish language there are a number of_ some changes, unrelated to each other, okay this is important, but le- but when look at them separately and then try to put it all together you might get the idea it does (xx) seem to indicate some sort of tendency. and the tendency is from going from let's say, you know put in linguistic terms from plus front, to either you want to state it as minus front or plus back, depending on how you want to handle you know binary features. for example you have today there's a change going on in the history of Spanish, probably the most noticeable change that's going on today, in the history of the Spanish language, uh to which uh probably is is an internal change without any doubt, but it's going on all over the Spanish speaking world and some of you may have even experienced this, especially after you you know cuz one of the first things first of all let me ask you this right how many of you have been to a Spanish speaking country? okay what wa- where were you? Spain what part of Spain? Madrid have you been south of Madrid? no now that doesn't help cuz this is uh Madrid doesn't do this at all but the South does how many of y- anybody here been to the south of Spain? or been in the Caribbean? or at least familiar even by listening to the radio or television, let's say with Cuban Spanish or Puerto Rican Spanish?  (xx) that's a very unlinguistic way of putting it you're right but that's a  does that even show in verb endings like pardon? yes well it affects verb ending it affects agree- it affects plural marking it affects agreements. (no) it's got very serious consequences in Spanish. so it changed all the verbs?  it certainly does. although it doesn't change the orthography you see uh but it does it s- it but orthography's secondary, so people speak they don't write, uh but i'll be with you in a minute okay? for example with the verb oh you're perfectly right although, many Spaniards today, obviously any educated Spaniard writes like this,  yes i think so. that's a problem that people have not studied, uh there are in pr- that's one of tho- one of those ongoing issues. i think there is, one notices in Caribbean Spanish where this loss of the S is very very predominant i mean it's almost, typical, in certain areas you know in certain countries the loss of S is considered to be lower class or regional. for example in Spain it's associated with oh um the first time you said  (uh) well i was just gonna say, that S didn't sound too far away from saying the,  when is it, that you want these uh papers in? the term papers? last day of class. (even though) earlier will be accepted. but the last day of class which is  	1
LEL220SU073.json	i just wanted to revisit this issue of when a positive portrayal, is negative. show a professional black family in a way that, um, a very white-collar family had been shown before. why is that positive? um well wha- so what should that do? you know wha- what should that do for African-Americans as a group? well it should change, or contribute to the change of stereotypes by uh, you know letting, letting other, letting out-groups know that there's another side to, (the story) right excellent. the the first argument is that, you know out-groups that is non-African-Americans, watching the Cosby Show, should get the idea that, African-Americans are not all, you know name your portrayal criminals, um i'm thinking of Sanford and Son junkmen, um blue-collar workers and so on. it's a counter stereotypical portrayal and should be teaching, white Americans that African-Americans can make it, you know up high as well. so, positive view, counter stereotypical it ignores like, the problems of discrimination (and stuff) why_ what would it do that was bad? what was the argument that the Cosby Show would be doing, to white American's views of African-Americans? it'd make it seem that, African-Americans who didn't succeed to that level, are just lazy okay, great. um, the negative view is that it, supports stereotype because i guess i would say, that i, i believe them, but i think that it's kind of unfair to criticize the show, on those terms because, it is, a sitcom and i think that, it has the positive characteristics so, why should one show have to embody all of these characteristics? why not say, you know this show is good because this shows that black people can reach this, this height in society, but then we should have other shows that also, portray other things. okay i'm gonna i'm gonna carry that comment on because i think it's a very valuable comment here. um, the the question is is it fair, to jump on one show and to say that this show should embody everything, that's needed for, a positive portrayal of a group? um and i'm gonna recall, your article that you had to read by Graves, just some thoughts from the Graves article, to try to frame your thoughts about the Cosby Show... the first thought, is... Graves makes a distinction between fiction and fact. African-American wr- writers?  submission or passivity right submission, submission, passivity, that's what Goffman argued too. so let me show you examples of this. this is from Goffman's book okay this is a little bit old and i, pho- photocopied it right from the book so it's a little fuzzy, but it's for a suit a man's suit. he uses gratifications? how? what would you um, if you're see- if they already have these attitudes, they'll seek out things that further them? so earlier sexism pu- sexism predicts later viewing, that's basically, what Morgan, would say. you know, well, if there's a causal link between early sexism and later viewing, since T-V tends to be, gender traditional, that for boys, already seeing the world in a somewhat sexist way predicts seeking out, more T-V. alright but you know why wouldn't it work that way for girls too? you know why wouldn't earlier sexism predict later viewing? if they're already more sexist they should be more, willing, to see, to be exposed to this content. they did use Morgan used a bunch of different controls, like, you know socioeconomic status, things like that that that also influence how much you view. but you know you always wanna keep in your mind, earlier sexism predicts later viewing for boys you know are, are sexist boys, less likely to have friends? and so they end up watching more T-V cuz they're not hanging out with their friends? you know there're all sorts of, possible explanations we don't know. whereas sexist girls may have a lotta friends because they're fitting in with this, you know a a desired stereotype for them. you know the way they define sexism was sort of anti-female it wasn't anti-male. it was, you know women don't have ambition, women, can't do certain things. so for a girl, to believe in that she may be, agreeable to others. for a boy to believe in that you know he maybe mean to girls. we don't know. i i actually don't know the answer to this and Morgan doesn't really either. um, Morgan's ex- saying, if there is a relationship, a causal relationship between early sexism and later viewing, i- it's probably a uses and gratifications kind of explanation. but there could be other ones that we, we can't, tell for certain from this study. okay. so there's one as far as this um, like slide is concerned would this have anything to do with like, like the way they do it is like they show you something and then like obviously like they prime it to you, and you're kind of thinking about it, and isn't that maybe the reason for the results? is that like, in general maybe like, it doesn't have as great of effect as like right after it's shown to you? it doesn't necessarily affect your life constantly but like you know for ten or fifteen minutes after you see it it will? yeah, i think, i think that's probably the best explanation for the process underlying this is a priming one. um, they may forget it. and it's short-term, you know the authors themselves say this is a short-term effect. you know o- o- odds are women, it's, you know when you've got_ and i'll talk about schemes in a moment, when you've got, your world view built up, four ads, may prime, you know more self-confident or more independent behaviors for a while. but four ads are not likely to change your world view. so it's not really, that these women suddenly went, i am powerful. it's that, somehow that was primed in_ it's not like they went i am powerful and i have learned this and now i will always have this with me. um, it probably lasted a short time, and then it went away. is that what you're asking? yeah kinda just that um, that they're basing like the results on like how this affects women, you know, in general i would think, yeah  right yeah i think that's a good point w- we do have to look at this as short-term. and it's probably priming that's responsible for it. now the question is, you know are there situations where even this, kind of short-term effect would actually affect, some major event in your life like how you behaved, at um you know a job interview? it may. then again if you're home, and you're not gonna do anything after this, once those thoughts are gone it may not have any effect. um they're really not, Jennings et al, really didn't, make conclusions like, you know this has a profound effect on women for a long time. they said, let's be honest here this is a short-term effect. but if you're exposed to these images, regularly throughout the day, maybe they do affect, you know your behavior mayb- maybe they affect how other people see you. just so you know in this same story_ or the same study, um they later found that exposing women to nontraditional portrayals versus traditional portrayals, made them write different essays concerning where they wanted to be in ten years. and again you can call this a priming effect. um those who were exposed to the, traditional ads, i'm sorry the traditional portrayals in the second part of the study, were less ambitious about whe- where they were gonna be in ten years. those exposed to the nontraditional ones, wrote things like, you know i'm gonna be the president of a company, you know they wrote more ambitious things. now again, does that mean, that these portrayals you know four minutes of portrayals, changed, these women's, aspirations for what they wanted to do in life? probably not. it probably was a priming effect that probably went away. but again the question is, when you're exposed day in and day out through magazines through television um, you know you're catching a portrayal at the airport while you're waiting for a plane. that counts too. so, how does this impact on, people's daily lives? that's something that Jennings et al aren't able to look at because they just did one, study, at one point in time. okay um, i don't wanna leave men out, so, what about men?  working or watching sports. working or watching sports. right it's Miller time was the whole idea that once you're off work now, it's time for beer. so working hard watching sports. yeah? male bonding like just a bunch of guys sitting together like screaming (xx) okay male bonding it's like, mostly all men. when there are women, what's the relationship between the men and the women?   i'd say social learning or cultivation why not priming? well i guess i mean it depends on how long, your effects are lasting if they're only feeling this way for, thirty minutes then you could say priming but (if the effects) last (xx) expecting to be something more like cultivation and (xx) or something. yeah? you (go ahead) if it was priming wouldn't the, men who had the most traditional roles be, i mean because they have the most networks already be, whereas the more traditional yeah this is this is certainly what you'd expect from a priming perspective. that's right that's what you'd expect. this doesn't seem to fit in with priming. but you know what? these authors didn't follow up the findings, they only looked at immediate, findings, right afterward. so we don't actually know. we can't really distinguish if it's social learning or priming if it's priming, it's going in a different direction than we would expect. if it's social learning as they argue, it would help if they had had, some kind of follow-up measures to see if there was some difference later on. because when you measure it right afterward, you know how do i know the difference in priming or social learning? priming is not going in the direction i'd expect it to but you can't go ooh it's not going in that direction let's just scrap our theory and switch to another one. you know you're not supposed to do that anyway although sometimes people do. um, so anyway kinda hard to explain. don't really know exactly why this happened. not consistent with other, kinds of priming findings. um, Garst and Bodenhausen's argument about n- you know these nontraditional men learning to be traditional, is just something, we're not gonna under- we're not gonna know, whether or not that's really happening without some follow-up. okay. uh so... combating negative effects? what are some considerations in this? four legs four legs. what else? a seat a seat. what else? a back a back. what's it made of? wood. okay wood.  you know this is your schema of a chair. now you know that a throne is also a chair, a stool is also a chair, a La-Z-Boy recliner is also a chair, even though these things don't have four legs, stool doesn't have a back, they can be made of metal not wood, but the point is that this four, four-legged, seat with the back made of wood is your schema of a chair. stereotypes, are defined as schemas. stereotypes are just schemas, of people... there's types of schemas.... so, we develop schemas, very very young. and the fact that we bring schemas to what we're viewing... is going to influence what we take away from what we're viewing. 	1

LEL115SU107.json	Hall's talk today, i put a sign up on the old room, and so some of you i hope got to hear it, or at least part of it it was still going along when i left so, i (had to) sort of sneak out. alright. we'll come back we may talk about, the acta- African Burial Grounds in New York later on in the course there are all sorts of, really interesting, things associated with the social and political things associated with it, also the_ Professor Hall didn't get a chance to talk about but we will be discussing things later on. i wanna start off today, just to say a couple of words simply because some of you have talked to me, about stuff that you're feeling confused with, and things that you feel a little uncomfortable about, (i wanna talk) for a minute about historicism, and for those of you who are anthropologists, or cultural anthropologists for sure, it won't be difficult for you to, relate to this. because the concept of cultural relativism, is, an extremely important thing in anthropology. this is the idea that when you study another culture, or when you are exposed to another culture, or simply to understand another culture, you need to understand it, from the perspective of that culture itself. you can't understand how somebody thinks, in ano- in another society in another culture without understanding the context of that thought. the same thing applies to history. the same thing applies to the history of racism, and it applies to the history of science. so when we look at people in the past now a large part of this class is looking at the history of science and the history of racism. you have to remember, to try to put yourself into the context, in which these people were living and thinking. they come from a different place and a different time. so sometimes virtually everybody that we'll be looking at historically, by the standards of today would be considered a racist. but in the context of their time, some were and some were not. and these are things that we need to consider. another thing you have to think about also and i think that for some of you guys, you might not be thinking about this because you don't think historically. um, in terms of biology, one of the th- you have to think of the relationship_ think about the way that people were thinking, in biology, a hundred years ago. a lot of the things that we take for granted, in terms of our understandings of genetics, our understandings of the relationships between genetics and evolution, are incredibly recent discoveries. very very very recent. realize that Gregor Mendel, who we talked about, was writing, in the, later nineteenth century. he was ar- his work was around at the same time as Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin never knew it. you know why? because, Gregor Mendel was Czech. and he was writing in German. and there was an enormous amount of, of um, almost not really nationalism but a certain amount of ethnocentrism, in science which exists today. There th- the work in some countries is not paid as much attention to, as the work in other countries. and Darwin and other English workers, were not really paying much attention to what was going on in the German world. and in the German literature. so this is something, to think about also nobody, was reading Mendel. very few people paid any attention to him at all and it wasn't really until, this century or not this century, the one we just left, the nineteenth, the the twentieth century, that people started to pay attention to genetics at all. and it really, Mendelian genetics really took off in the nineteen twenties. but what did people know about genes then? genes were, theories. no one saw a gene. no one knew what a gene looked like, nobody knew what D-N-A was. when did, when did Watson and Crick live? anybody know? fifties. in the fifties. when was it really established and when was it really permeating, the academic communities? in the sixties. when did people act- when were people actually able, to sequence D-N-A? the last fifteen years. fifteen twenty years we're looking at really recent stuff. and for a large portion of, the history of biology, a lot of things, were based on inference which is fine because, that's really how most science is done. many of the things that we consider to be scientific facts, are actually theories and we will talk about that, in the beginning of next week. but in terms of genetic observations these are incredibly recent things and th- y- you need to keep these things in mind, when we talk about the history of the field and when we talk about things that seem, so crazy and strange, when we talk about them in the past, we need to keep in mind, that these are based on the knowledge that was available at the time and they actually made a lot of sense. they weren't silly things, necessarily. but they weren't particularly silly things there are things we need to keep in mind in terms of the history, of anthr- of of biology. so for much of the history of biology genes, were not observed. that's a very very recent thing. and that's added to our knowledge enormously. so what are the big questions? the big questions, that people had, from the very beginning of biology, are still being asked today. and i sort of jotted down what are some of these big questions? what are, how does the body know how to develop? how does the body_ how come all humans develop the same way? how does the body know how to develop? those were big questions then. how are traits transmitted? and we we know an awful lot about transmission genetics. how does the body know how to develop that first question? that is ontogeny, the idea that we were talking about last time. ontogeny is the development of the individual. and the study of that development is called ontogeny. actually let me just put up where we were last time... (xx) just leave it there (for me) better what's the difference in the geologic time (scales?) i'm sorry? how how much difference in time scales (is there?) in time scale? between the, punctuated equilibrium oh. the time scale doesn't hafta really vary that much at all. the idea is, basically, here the idea is that the branch- that the process between form A and form B is a gradual one. it's just an accumulation of changes. what he would argue here, is that the process of transformation, is very fast. and it depends on the species. w- but, in the case of something with long generations like us it could be, you know within maybe even a hundred thousand years. which is a drop in the bucket when we think about, when we think about big time. which, is a different, way of thinking about time. but we'll get into (it) in (on that) another_ which we'll get into in another time. that when we think about, evolutionary time and geological time, with long lived organisms like we are, we're really looking, at what seems to us, a very very long long long period of time. but, in terms of the history of the earth and in terms of the history of our species, they're actually rather short periods of time. so, yeah? so punctuated equilibrium requires like a, massive dying off, (the) that's how they would explain that, exactly. that there would be a dying off of species A. it_ i'll come back to this in a second when we talk about speciation models, because it really is derived, from a model of Ernst Mayr, called, that he talks about s- i suspect in that article, i get those articles mu- muddled up, called peripatric speciation. and this is generally, agreed it's most most people agree that this is how speciation generally occurs. when one species splits into two... imagine you have a species, not like humans cuz humans are weird because we live everywhere. but imagine you have a species that lives happily in some, location. in some general area. and there are lots and lots of populations all these little circles are populations, (xx) they can't interbreed? they can't interbreed exactly. because they really are, essential categories. the ways that most people define species these days, is based on interfertility. members of a species can interbreed. and members of a, separate species cannot. and so that's why species, probably of all the taxomonic te- taxonomic categories, really, is in a sense a very typological thing so it really conforms, to the mindset, of, people in the field... but all of the categories, were treated, all of Linneas's categories were treated, in the same way that species were. they were types. they couldn't be transcended. they were fixed types. that he had described that were a part of nature. that couldn't be transcended. and the species was almost always the foremost and most, strong of these things. after Darwin there was an attempt to evolutionize the taxonomy. what were these taxonomies based on? (think about this) Linneas based it on morphology right? he based it on how things looked. things that looked more similar, were things that had similar embryologies, were things that, resembled each other he thought, should be grouped into the same group so if he was looking for a number of species, to put into a genus, he did it basically based on what they looked like. and what people have tried to do since, Darwin since Darwin, is try to evolutionize the taxonomies that Linneas created. sometimes it works. because morphology, peop- animals tend to look a lot alike if they're more closely related to each other. so often these taxonomies, really do reflect evolutionary relationships. but sometimes they don't... sometimes they don't. it was want- people_ when you evolutionize taxonomy you want to have taxonomy represent phylogeny. okay? you want the taxonomy to represent evolutionary relationships. let me give you an example of how it doesn't work. sometimes. perfect example is us, as human beings... we're traditionally considered to be a part of a superfamily, called the hominoidea. right. the hominoidea is a superfamily, this is a great example. i was just wondering if the classification of superfamily comes before or after family? it comes above family. so after  it doesn't set us apart pardon? it doesn't set us  oops how do you determine the structure of the cladogram? like    mm no (xx) my question is, who determines that, there was one shoot here and then two_ re- regardless of who you f- finally assign those groups  oh just why is it determined like a triangle like that? yeah or however you wanna, however you wanna visualize it. well because wheth- it's always m- it uh it's always basically no matter how big your cladogram becomes, at its core it is always resolved in trichotomies. so there's always three. so two have to be closer together than a third, and this is just how it's drawn out as a convention. so what you're doing is sh- showing the relationship of two things here, and a more distant one there. the idea being that this would be the dif- the common ancestor, of these two, right? and then this would be, the common ancestor of all three. does this make sense...? cuz you're looking at three and you're really looking at the, you're looking at the um, at the, just at at_ you're really trying to just it's just a relative thing, which of the two are more closely related to the third. time is not an issue on a cladogram. but would the possibility for instance that, all three of them diverged at the same time? like (if)  that, that has a lot to do with how, Mayr talks about how mhm right... and, the other thing also is to- because_ and you gotta think about it also in terms of monophyletic groups. let's talk about monophyletic groups so we can come back to this again. because, if there's a triple branch, there's not_ we're not gonna have monophyly. and and let's, talk about this in just a second. a monophyletic group is an ancestor of all its descendents right? so down here this all this whole thing could be considered, if this is all the descendents. if these are all the descendents that are possible, this down here, could be considered mono- the whole f- cluster could be a monophyletic group. because there would be the ancestor and here are all the descendents. this actually isn't because there're actually other descendents as well. but, in certain certainly in circumstances it could. each branch though here, is a monophyletic group you have the ancestor of all the orangutans not at the node but just beyond the node, basically (here,) of al- this ancestor and all its descendents, all orangutans all_ everything along this clade, is a result of this one ancestor. this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor and all of its descendents. and this branch here is supposed to be the ancestor of all of its descendents. and so all of these, sticks, are considered to be monophyletic groups and for cladistics to work, they need to be monophyletic groups. Rachel hm sure, yeah? i have a question of what uh, what would a non-monophyletic group look like? a non-monophyletic group_ let's_ okay... it's assumed for instance that all of these higher categories are not monophyletic. recently, it's been argued, that in fact, reptiles are not monophyletic. because, these are all_ reptiles are, a class, and so are birds, and so for that, you you would expect that a mon- monophyletic group would include an ancestor and all of its descendents. but birds, are among the an- are the among the descendents of reptiles. it's now pretty well understood that birds evolved from reptiles. and so that if you had the ancestor of all reptiles, you would have to include birds as well within it. if you include all its descendents. and so reptiles now would not be considered a monophyletic group. therefore that taxonomy, is not a good evolutionary taxonomy, according to these systematics. birds however, within the reptiles, would be a monophyletic group. and so it would be a single ancestor of all the birds, and then all its descendents. another example of a non-monophyletic group would be if there were multiple, would be some hypotheses that we'll be talking about in terms of race. all the polygenic theories, of race would be non-monophyletic theories. because then you'd have multiple ancestors, and multiple descendents. s- any category below the species level, in addition, is not a monophyletic group. certainly in humans, it is not a monophyletic group. there is no such thing, as a pure race (okay) and that's what (it would) imply. but a lot of people model races, as monophyletic groups and we'll be coming to that. there's no such thing, as an ancestor of all, members of a single race, and all it's descendents. because there's gene flow, between members of different racial groups. yeah? i mean an- (xx) so that would be another example of a non-monophyletic group. so if races are treated like this, and this is what we'll be coming to, if races are treated like this, it's an inappropriate application, of cladistics, because races are not monophyletic. there's gene flow between, the branches. and it's probably not fair to even model races this way as branches at all. because whenever you're modeling things as branches, you're assuming, monophyly. an ancestor and all its descendents... okay. the steps of cladistics i was s- what time is it? oh we've got time. um no 	1
COL605MX132.json	i think i can handle it. okay it's, you can even hold onto it   okay, you guys ready? mhm okay i think we'll get started, um, uh, i wanna welcome everybody i'm Sidonie Smith and i'm director of Women's Studies here at the university and you're in the new home of Women's Studies and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender Lane Hall was just renovated and we moved in over the summer. so it's a lovely building and a building in which uh, uh a lot of things take place a lot of talks like today's talk. um i'm going to introduce Rosemary in a minute but i just want to um, tell you about some upcoming events um Women's Studies and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender uh who co-sponsor almost all the events that are in_ take place in Lane Hall have a series going called Gendered Worlds Women's Lives in Transnational Perspective. um that's throughout this term uh there are s- some of these are, some of these posters are on the table outside so please pick one up, i just call your attention to the next one in the series, um Maria Messner from the University of Vienna is going to be here on Friday at noon and she's going to talk, uh give a talk called the Gender of Politics A Transnational Study of the Meanings of Gender in the Political Field and she's looking at four Eastern European countries, and the ways in which the word gender is invoked and how it means s- signifies differently in these different countries. um, i also wanna call attention to a uh talk this afternoon um we have a the Institute for Research on Women and Gender is um, searching for a new director to take over from Abby Stewart who's be- was the founding director and has been this_ a major leadership force on campus and we have a couple candidates coming in in the next month. the first one is in this afternoon um, i- is in now Barbara Gutech, uh whose fields are in organizational behavior and psychology and she's speaking this afternoon on gender and the reasonable woman standard, in hostile environment cases of sexual harassment and that's over in the, u- East Hall in Psychology Fourth Floor and there are some um flyers for that. um, okay um, now i'd like to introduce our guest speaker. um, and this again this uh talk is sponsored co-sponsored by Women's Studies and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender. probably all of you are here because you know doctor Ruether's work um uh, many of us have been reading her for a long time and have appreciated her groundbreaking work. Rosemary Radford Ruether is a Catholic feminist theologian. she teaches at the Garrett Theological Seminary and she's also a member of the graduate faculty at Northwestern University, in Evanston Illinois. um, there she teaches courses on the interrelationship of Christian theology and history to social justice issues. including sexism, racism, poverty, militarism, ecology, and interfaith relations. she holds a B-A in philosophy from Scripps College, an M-A in ancient history, and a PhD in classics and patristics from the Claremont Graduate School, in Claremont California. she also holds twelve honorary doctoral degrees, the most recent from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in ninety-four and, from the University in Uppsala, Sweden two-thousand just this year. go ahead   yeah  conservative yeah, hm i don't no it means uh a rejection of a, uh of a heavenly time that is believed to soon be coming or some redemptive new age believed to be coming. uh in the Kingdom of God where there will be no more marrying and giving in marriage. uh and it's assumed i- uh it is it is said in the New Testament those who are anticipating this new age, where there'll be no more marrying or giving in marriage do not marry now in other words they they begin to anticipate this new age where there's no marrying, or giving in marriage. secondly uh, many people in Jesus' time could not marry. slaves were forbidden to marry, uh... soldiers could not marry during their time of duty, um many poorer people uh could not afford to marry or were not allowed to marry outside of their ethnic group. uh and early Christianity seems to have been made up of many disenfranchised people without families. thirdly uh the church or the community of believers is seen, uh then as their alternative family, um, you might say their surrogate family, uh the true family of brothers and sisters gathered outside of these oppressive systems of society, and supporting these disenfranchised people. now this view of the church as a new or true family continues in Paul, Paul's writings are larded with analogies drawn from the family and from the, patriarchal slaveholding household of the Roman world. Christians are said to be like slaves, who have been emancipated, and who have been adopted by the father of the household as true children. or, this is an mhm  hm hm hm  damn go for it right on no we have some more time.  i think we can (actually) stay here till about one-thirty  thirty-one minutes so we actually have plenty of time for discussion although some of you may need to rush off to your, one-fifteen class or something, uh yeah? are are are you suggesting that in the in the last few minutes of your talk you you said the church should uh, look at different uh different mo- it appeared to me that you were saying different models of relationships and so forth. are you saying that uh, that the union of the male and the female should not be something intended uh, until death do do them part? uh i w- was not, primarily talking about temporary unions. uh although i think that there there is, perhaps a place for the church uh to work with young people, who are forming um live-in relations prior to permanent commitment. uh i think the church has, abandoned young people at this stage of life and basically, said that you know between puberty at twelve and marriage at, thirty you know when you finish your PhD at the univers-  right  now        yeah? you use the word redemptive, several times redemptive community. could you, expand on the word redemptive? what i mean by redemptive is just and loving. in other words redemptive communities are communities which are, which which do not ap- one person is not oppressed by the other, uh the women are not expected to to to uh do all the serving and get no d- none of the development which is the traditional patriarchal marriage that is not a redemptive relationship that is an unjust relationship. uh, um, you know children are not obviously beaten and raped and so on. so and so that one, one has to uh, uh much of the traditional patriarchal family has been um, violent and unjust. and it has been sanctioned as as normal because it's somehow blessed and and and uh, and and officially married uh you might say all of the energy of the church has gone into, uh condemning uh people for having uh relationships outside marriage. um, but there has been no effort to say that uh, oppre- you know uh, wife rape or ch- uh you know, abusing your children or or simply assuming that your wife should, uh should be the uh dependent person who doesn't, isn't allowed to really develop her own uh, life uh that that these are in fact uh, violent and sinful relationships. so i th- i think th- uh one has to critique that as, i- first of all i- it's it's not the order of creation. um can you say a little bit more it seems like there's a growing gap between the uh Christian right, and the, uh Christian left     uhuh yeah yeah. i don't believe that the Christian right and the Christian left are in communion with each other. they may be in the same denomination they're not in communion. essentially what we have is, is schism, within almost all our denominations. uh, uh between um, you know let's say in the Methodist church between Good News Methodists who i refer to as Bad News Methodists and, yeah  hm given what you said about the long term trend towards both having two workers uh, in in families, um i wonder if you could explain_ my understanding of fundamentalist movements whether they're Christian Buddhist Muslim Jewish, are that their agenda is the re- reestablishing of the patriarchal family that that is their political agenda. why, why is it that then, these movements are growing in low income communities in the black community. why is the fundamentalist church growing in the black community at this point? uh, well i i i first wanna say that that it is startling the extent to which all of the fan- fundamentalisms share, this agenda about controlling women and putting them back in their place. um i think the idea of uh, of the nonworking wife, is very attractive to poor people who haven't had the luxury of work- of of hav- um, i have been an an Episcopal minister for about forty-five years. uhuh uhuh, well maybe you just can't do all that. maybe you (can't do all that)    i was just having another idea that i i probably uh shouldn't say but if everybody doesn't sit under a klieg light and know exactly what everybody else is doing there're an awful lot of churches where there are very far right, and very far left people and they don't quite know what each other think and they aren't very thoughtful, and philosophical so they don't hate each other. yeah  at best i mean it's kind of you know anonymous and there's ten thousand of you anyway and there's eight masses and you know and, uh and so you can kinda get along because you communicate on a kinda superficial level so that's you know one way to do it, but some of that is because, uh i think, Christians in churches are, encouraged not to talk, about something that would be a- uh appear to be anti-scriptural. uhuh   or they should yeah mhm yeah what are you gonna think_ what's gonna happen in the United States now cuz we have like a John Ashcroft there and i believe he's a fundamentalist. right right oh really? yeah it i- you run that off the internet and you'll find out. okay,   i i think the the lib- the liberals have uh adequate num- amount of money i mean a lot of the conservatives are not  i just wanted to say that i have a few copies left of both of your books Woman and red- Redemption and Christianity and the Making of the Modern Family. they're at a discount which we got especially for the presentation so, see me afterwards. well i have to go and jump on an airplane so i'm gonna say good-bye to you all. thank you thank you very much 	1
LEL115JU090.json	okay... let's get started. quiet please. oh did you, make those slides (on the) transparencies (xx) how did you (manage to) do that? i did (xx) they're nice.  right. you know i was planning to uh, (xx) under the new (xx) and one of the things that i noticed was that the transparencies were (xx) which was (xx) know how to do that, you have to send the form. do you know how_ did you turn in the form? (i mean) only on paper. i don't think that you can, i think you'd need a color LaserJet. because that probably (isn-) no, i've got a color DeskJet at home. (oh okay) can you make regular transparencies on that? well no, i apparently (xx) black ones (and there all) they did the transparencies. so i've got a LaserJet, so i've been using the LaserJet to produce the uh, the transparencies, but i don't have a color LaserJet. because the LaserJet sort of, puts, puts things on well what do you do? do you take uh? how do you make th- these from (slides?) do you take these to (Kinko's?) well, no these are a few pictures from Guyana, so these are some of the pics- (xx) (you drop off your pictures) (xx) but you can, like the one on the ad, mhm  Kolossus? mhm. (xx) (xx) just use, P- PowerPoint now. she scans pictures in and then she has them in the computer, and and then projected them (xx) no, i don't know i know (xx) okay we start with, we start with the middle of that line i introduced excuse me... so if you start looking at production distribution consumption, we're starting in the middle at distribution. and the theories that have arisen out of th- examination of distribution, is called exchange theory. exchange being another way of thinking about, distributing things. so, for a period of time, exchange theory was what dominated, early anthropolo- economic anthropology. because it was seen, it was it was theorized in response to what what then the dominant, economic model. which is neoclassical economic theory, as emblemized by, Adam Smith. and the book goes into that um, what what neoclassical economic theory is, that it's th- emphasis on the free market, as the motor of capitalism, that it's free because there are no traditional restrictions, determining, how things are distributed, in previous times, you know only nobles could get certain things, and some thing- there were there were d- restrictions on, how things could be distributed. now the free market is free because those rest- restrictions, supposedly don't exist. that prices fluctuate in response to the laws of supply and demand, um, that the market determines levels of production, and consumption. all this should be familiar to you, and, capitalism is the only form of economic rationality. well, the logical extension of that, of course is that, noncapitalist societies are irrational and that is something that, we do not accept. so in trying to promote that the response to this dominant paradigm... anthropologists came up with the idea of exchange theory. and, they were called substantists, substantivists excuse me. they were responding to people called formalists. formalists are there were some people within anthropology who did find that neoclassical economic theory was applicable, to noncapitalist societies, um, but substantivists rejected that claim, in saying that it's not applicable, you have to understand each society's economic system on its own basis. and so they say that, there's more than one possible economic rationality. that contrary to capitalist thought everything, does not have a price and is not for sale. that the self-interested materialism of Western capitalism, is not universal. and that trying to force non-Western economies into these Western models, irrespective of fit, is doomed to failure. because you're just you're you're imposing this. moreover they point out that the capitalist market is a relatively recent invention in the history of, humanity, and that it is not the only mode of exchange. so that noncapitalist societies have alternate modes of exchange, and they di- distribute goods in accordance with their cultural values. so, the, what goes into some examples of what these kinds of exchange are, um, in broad sweeping_ to paint it_ sweeping terms, you can you can think about it this way. that, in the West, wealth is measured by how much we consume. the house you live in, the car you drive, the clothes you wear, the number of C-Ds you have in your collection, etcetera etcetera etcetera. we ch- that's how, that's the mark o- of how wealthy someone is. how much you consume, how much you can consume. but in other parts of the world, as in Africa, and in the Northwest Coast, wealth is seen by how much you give away. that the true mark of a wealthy man, is how m- is that he can give tons of money away, gifts, you know, he can constantly give things away. so it's not the consumption but the distribution, that is the marker of wealth. so Marshall Sahlins identified three modes of exchange. in saying that, there's an alternative to the West, he c- had to come up with some alternatives. so these are, reciprocity, redistribution, and market exchange being what the the West is famous for... so there are three kinds, of reciprocity, according to Marshall Sahlins. and these are, generalized reciprocity, which is where you give something with no expectation that it will be returned immediately, anytime soon... second thing is balanced reciprocity, and the example in the book was at, Christmas time, when you give gifts but you also expect to receive gifts. so, that's balance. when there's an equal exchange, when an exchange is made with the expectation that, there will be a a return to you within a prescribed period of time. so that's called balanced reciprocity. and the third one is negative reciprocity, the attempt to get something for nothing. so haggling at the market, that's if you wanna go that far. that's called negative reciprocity... redistribution is the second mode of exchange. and that is where, a central organization or a central person and the example was, the IRS, as an organization. the example of a person in a chiefdom would be a chief, who, accepts contributions from everybody in a society and then redistributes it, according to the needs, of everyone in society. so redistribution, is another form, of exchange. so as you can see these two, reciprocity and redistribution, are not in keeping with the capitalist mode. i mean there's no prices involved, um, al- the things that go on with market exchange are, do not apply. so, potlatch is something that appears in the Northwest Coast, of North America. and, that's a very famous example that anthropologists have used, to talk about, redistribution as a mode of exchange. because that's where, some noble in in this_ these Native American communities will take a lot of wealth and just give it away, or burn it, you know just, get rid of it. but, a lot of it is giving it away. and so that's seen as, irrational, or like that like he's not getting any profit from this_ why would someone do that? why would they take all their wealth and just give it all away? but that's because, in part, people who, who are confused by that are seeing wealth, and profit in singularly material terms. so that, if if if wealth is only the things that you have, then it's hard for you to understand how you can still be wealthy after you've given all that stuff away. but in other societies, wealth is measured by many different things, so you can get prestige, you can raise your status in society by having done that which is worth more than things, the dishes and the pots and everything else that you've just given away and redistributed to everybody. so, a potlatch is an example, a very famous example of redistribution. another example would be rotating credit associations. these are found all over, the world. and that's where an- i- particularly strong in women's groups. um and my experience again in Africa, has has led me to see how these things work. a rotating credit association is where, a group of women will get together. and mind you, you know life is hard. and so, your daily needs, your your daily income, whatever you do, generally just about covers what your daily needs are. and there's often not a lot of surplus there. so when a big expense comes along, like you need a new roof, or, your child needs the school fees to be paid, something big, or y- you have somebody who's getting married and you know that that's gonna be a major expenditure. when something big comes along, that often cripples the the little, person. i me- i don't mean b- but, someone who doesn't have access to a lot of wealth. so, what rotating s- credit associations do, is that they pu- you get together, with a group of your friends, people who you trust, and everyone puts in, a certain amount of money every month. and one person gets to walk away every month with the whole lump sum. and you'll plan it out, like as as you get together a woman will say, you know in October i'm gonna need to pay my scon- you know my son's school fees. and, another woman will say well, and then in November, my daughter's getting married. so, it will be planned so that somebody, everyone benefits from getting a big lump sum of money that they wouldn't be able to build themselves, on a daily basis. so that's another way of distributing, funds. in East Africa you have these things called dance societies as well, where purportedly the idea was people get together and enjoy life, and that this is a form of entertainment, getting together and dancing, and performing at weddings and stuff like that. but another thing, those societies served as self-help s- organizations too. people would come together and would help out, contribute their labor, and contribute money and gifts, for big events. so funerals and weddings being the primary two. so that if you had such an event in your family, you n- you could depend on your your dance society to come in, and show up on these required day, and be there to help cook, be there with all the extra plates you're gonna need to distribute the food, and be there to contribute money, for, all the other additional costs, that are entailed. so dance societies also serve this function, for redistributing wealth... and i put here secret societies with a question mark in America because, we have such things. and, and it's a way of maybe not distributing money so much as distributing contacts, getting, getting knowledge out about different people and, leads in to jobs and stuff like that. that can be seen as a redistribution as well, redistribution of knowledge and services and contacts. 	1
LEL200MU110.json	good morning. today we're going to be talking about polyprotic acids, which are acids that have more than one easily ionizable hydrogen, and among the most important of these are the amino acids. which exist in proteins and peptides, and so we're going move to those as soon as we, cover some of the basics, with, some simpler, polyprotic acids. i have on the board acetic acid, as the, archetypal carboxylic acid, and then i have two... diprotic acids, succinic acid resonance? hm? (isn't it resonance?) is it resonance? well the resonance if i draw the, structure of the anion in each case you have (inductive and that's supposed to) take away the negative charge a little bit  the oxygen atoms. the other carboxylic acid group here. okay? so i have the partially positive carbon these oxygens more electronegative than carbon and so i have, an electron withdrawing effect, through the bonds, of one carboxylic acid group stabilizing the carboxylate anion in the other case. so this, base, is weaker, than the base, in, acetic- acetate ion. because there's two negative charges after that? because i already have a negative charge in the molecule so let's just write a little, equation for, the removal of the second proton the dipole is, weaker when more carbon atoms (xx) i have a l- greater distance between the two carboxylic acid groups. so my inductive effect, if i ionize this one (negative charges) (xx) again with negative charges are further apart from each other, and therefore it's not as hard to remove a proton from this end of the molecule, when this end is negative, as it was with succinic acid where the charges were closer together. okay? any questions about what we've done so far?  the one on oxygen is gonna leave first. so the first deprotonation of this polyprotic acid and this is why i'm calling it a polyprotic acid i've got two protons here that i can lose positive charge (xx) increase (xx) stabilize the (xx) so i have the positive charge on this nitrogen, exerting an inductive effect, stabilizing, the negative charge, on the carboxylate anion. okay? so that this is, considerably more acidic, than what we expected by just comparing it to acetic acid. the amino group, it depends on whether you compare it to ammonia, ammonium ion which has a P-K-A of about nine-point-four, or methylammonium ion which is about ten, it lies somewhere in that range. and you can argue, two ways, you can say well it's a little more basic than you expect these electrons are a little more available because they're close to a negative charge, or you can argue well... you have the carboneal group there still, therefore it makes it a little more, unavailable, it lies right at the cusp of where you expect it to be and so it's a little hard to make an argument about that as well. well we're interested, in two numbers. one of them is, that for a technique that is very often used in analyzing for amino acids or peptides proteins and in separating them. and that's called electrophoresis, where you put a substance on a gel, and you put two electrodes on it, and then you watch to see where, the compound migrates, in this electric field. and there is, a point at which no migration takes place. and that P-H is called the isoelectric point. the point in whi- at which the charges within the molecule are balanced, so that it migrates neither to the positive electrode nor to the, negative electrode. when you say physiological P-H of the zwitterions, (ones) what about the (alpha) classes of blue (lines) doesn't, the uh basic form also exist? yes, but the, you know the blue is just beginning to grow in at those P-Hs, there's very little of it. so what is the predominant form there? that's what we're talking about. and if i did it accurately if i calculated at every point what the concentrations were, i may have exaggerated how early the blue really begins to appear. but the point i'm really trying to make is that it doesn't suddenly become blue. that there is some blue, way back... any other questions?  the one on the carboxylic acid, the one with the lowest P-K-A alpha you said that the isoelectric point was also the arithmetic mean, is that only for diprotic? no it's the arithmetic mean oh just between those two. between those two. what is the H-A and which_ what is the A-minus, for that particular range okay? any other questions about what i've done. 	1
ADV700JU023.json	so. i see that you're from Hartland Michigan yes mhm, like forty minutes from here yeah okay, and uh, you say that you're interested in prebusiness and economics i was i don't think that i am anymore okay cuz you write a lot about international business. mhm i wro- i w- i'm interested in the um, international aspect,  okay so what, what changed your mind and what has it been changed to? um, i, don't know if i wanna sp- like i wanna experience like you know, cultures and and the world and and  oh have you done any digs or anything like that? no i'm really like dinosaurs like fascinate me like that stuff fascinates me but i don't know if that's like a career choice yet but i, was looking through the course book and i know they offer like a w- half a term class or something,  geology short courses mhm  both geology and biological anthropology, will lead you, that way. mhm mhm  right right mhm mhm right mhm  mhm mhm      mhm mhm  mhm   being an accountant yeah i could oh dear well, now Dr Crown talked about rules and regs and degree requirements and what it is that you need to get out of here and, i don't wanna talk about, what you need to do to graduate, i wanna talk about, how your interests will translate into the courses that you wanna   mkay okay mkay right right, um okay okay then, uh, math and chemistry are a little bit murkier, because, if you had said to me gee you wanted pre-med, you wanted a biology concentration that's really what you wanted to do, then i would say well you gotta take math and, chemistry, because you need chemistry before you can take biology and ma- you need a year of, math if you're gonna be a biology concentrator you need two years if you're gonna be doing microbiology or something like that, right mhm mhm mkay mhm   right  okay you know, you might wanna do that, and then you might wanna take, this biological anthro course or a beginning geology course or,  right, okay right, okay  exactly, okay okay mhm mhm mkay there's, two booklets that we got i'm no uh i'm referring to this i'm not sure if i remember that one oh, you will, you will remember, i guarantee you oh, yeah, okay, right, i  mhm oh okay okay okay, oh that would be go- that would be now uh one thing i haven't asked you, is, eh- whether you took any A-P tests in May. i did and i know the, the um, the outcome? yeah. i got a four, on the English language one, okay oh okay so your English language A-P was a four. mhm it will give me credit? oh yeah. but that will, but_ uh Dr Crown also explained how that does not mean  exactly, exactly i think you get six actually i don't remember wow wow, for a four, that's good that's good and um i_ do you give any credit at all for threes? uh  okay, in some departments threes do earn you credit in others not, so European History you have to have a four or a five okay i wasn't sure uh, you can get a three in poli sci or physics if you get threes, you get credit, but not, not in history okay,   okay mhm mhm    mkay, mkay mkay    mhm well could i take that maybe like second semester? it's taught every term oh it is,  right right, right. now do you know where you're gonna be living? Mo-Jo Mo-Jo   hm'm, no i'm not okay mhm, uh this evening, there is another session, with the peer advisors, at seven-thirty, in one of the computing classrooms which is right next by  okay like the bulletin, that we had no huh'uh okay it's really easy i'll show you. you know you know what the web is yeah mhm mkay mkay  mhm mkay yeah the uh those were the,  oh yeah, and i... i might even wanna, take a, astronomy course or something i, yeah yeah now you see this here, this is a course in paleontology oh it is,  mhm  mkay right mkay oh, that would be  uhuh, so look at those two tonight okay, definitely mkay mkay great okay? i'm excited      bye first day and a half was  yeah  oh alright well, uh well we can start with that. mkay they're i'm mhm yeah i have. especially of recent i did a lot of tutoring my senior year,  mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mm. i was thi- i i think that if i... i i really enjoyed teaching elementary language mhm mhm uhuh mhm right yeah, it it was wonderful, i mostly tutored in algebra, mhm mhm oh yeah, mhm mhm mhm   yeah yeah  why? now what what brought you to that? i know it_ kind of like the corny way like a lot of kids might learn about it my father is a doctor, uhuh  mhm mhm mhm yeah mhm one of the nice things about, the, requirements that you have to take, that Dr Crown talked about, mhm yeah mhm mhm mhm right right uhuh oh i did? mhm oh okay, good. that's what, yeah that's actually what i was thinking, cuz i do have oh no you didn't oh i didn't? excuse me oh you placed into the one-thirty.  which is the general. now did you take the A-P Chemistry? no, no okay alright, well... i think probably given this score, really? uh, some of it is going to s- seem like repetition, yeah  really? yeah. so i think i'd say Chemistry one thirty and i'd say either Great Books or Classical Civilization, and, your math score is real good, uh did you take A-P Ca- Calculus? yes A-B or B-C? A-B and have you gotten your scores already? no. i hadn't gotten them yet before i left. so okay, so how do you think you did on that do you think? um, i wanna say i got a four. okay mkay mhm mhm      oh okay alright well that, if you got a four that'll place you out of a first semester of, of math. of calculus. that would give you credit for Math one-fifteen, which is the first semester of calculus here, and then the issues become, oh gee should i, take Honors Calculus should i take the one-eighty-five sequence. i do, yeah i_ that was what i was leaning towards, mhm mm. if you like math, i do feel, yeah see i_ students who say oh well i might as well just take, Honors Math because i need another honors course, those are the students who probably shouldn't be taking Honors Math.   i do mhm right mhm  you understand that? mhm yeah. you'll be you'll re- you'll be getting kind of a nasty little letter, it's not a nasty letter it's just that it's very businesslike, ruff ruff ruff mkay if i did get a four or a five though, wou- would that mean should i opt to take like the two-ninety-five? uh, or mhm  okay i actually think i'd like to go, probably just with one-eighty-five, okay it's probably, it's probably safe to sign up for   now your Spanish placement or,  oh really yeah, it's that, sort of, in between the first and the second year course, mhm okay but if so this is a time that you_ you know you might think about another language, uh cuz if you started a brand new language, if there's something that you'd rather take that makes more sense to you, then you just have one additional semester of that language to do so that would be just a four-semester shot then for you. oh, i really like French. alright oh, alright  mhm  yeah, not really spoken right, go back to ancient Greece and, no okay so, what we're saying is, so like Math one-eighty-five sounds to me like Math one-eighty-five, either Great Books or Classical Civilization, French one-oh-three and then French one-oh-three so you think Chemistry one-thirty because, if i want, i did wanna be a pre-med major. so i i suppose i mean i will obviously  no no it's okay mhm mhm mhm mhm see people who score in the seventieth percentile and better, on the chemistry placement are put into the two-ten two-eleven, mhm yeah cuz i   yeah mhm mhm      that i i should probably solidify? yeah, yeah. see you've got your two honors courses with the math and the Great Books or Class Civ_ which one are you leaning toward? Great Books Great Books. okay with math and Great Books you got your two honors courses, and you're starting on your way, with,   okay   fall alright oh. mhm  oh really? mhm oh and then organic would be two-ten two-eleven that's one semester and then two-fifteen two-sixteen that's the second semester. and you'd be taking two-fifteen two-sixteen in the fall term next year. mm okay, my sophomore year, and so, this is a semester so i'm i'm taking oh gosh this is  i'm taking a semester of inorganic then mhm mhm mhm right. oh uh, you should look here on, on in the bulletin, when you have  uhuh. page thirty-three you said? mhm and that just tells you... just exactly what all the pre-med requirements are, see and if you decide to be a biology concentrator, mhm okay. ooh. alright okay? yeah now, you're going to be meeting with, the peer advi- peer advisors again this evening, are you living in Honors Housing? yes. okay, so you will go to a meeting with Earl at seven o'clock?   yeah oh i have been uhuh okay mhm okay mhm okay. alright, thanks. alright? um, am i taking_ with Chem one-thirty is there like a one other something for a lab? is that well there's one-twenty-five but, you don't have to take it because you've had a lab yeah definitely okay alright really? because it, you know it, just reinforces what you're doing in the one_ in the lecture and the discussion and the recitation lab it's a completely, it's kind of a separate class though?  is it, is this an overload would you think? 'm'm, no no   mhm. um, okay if they're taking,  okay is this sixteen right now? 'm'm isn't the lab only one credit? it's fifteen right now oh it's fifteen, okay lab is two credits. so i could just uh, s- even solidify and strengthen it, mhm mhm alright? whoo  alright,  you too okay.    yeah i want_ i was_ i'm thinking of possibly going into uh work with genetics uhuh and how did you come to that? i had, my first two years of high school i took two biology courses and we, were exposed to some genetics, and i thought it was pretty interesting. mhm mhm, mhm. okay, so, so you took biology and chemistry and physics in high school? mhm and did you take any A-P courses? yeah i took, i took A-P Calculus, A-P A-B or B-C? A-B. A-B.  oh you took a lot. now did you take tests in all of those? just the lit and history. okay. and, do you know your scores yet? history, i took that my junior year and i got a four on that, i haven't gotten  yes okay. well that, American History four will give you credit for the first year's worth of American history here. okay mhm  mhm yeah i took both the, lang and comp and lit and comp. and how do you feel about those? i think i did pretty good, po- possibly fours if you get fours or fives in those, then you're going to get six credits for each, okay mhm  uhuh uhuh right  it means that you get an earlier CRISP date, and so you uh, some of the courses that are typically sort of first-year-student courses, right okay uhuh mhm um, i'm not really sure which way i wanna go with that so, mhm mkay. you're very very lucky because pre-med and biology prerequisites pre-med requirements uhuh right uhuh mhm  mhm mhm okay mhm uh, no, Polish Polish yes okay. uh, i saw that, i saw the Z uhuh mhm yeah i was thinking about whether or not i wanted to take a different language yeah. you might wanna take Polish or you might say to yourself well gee, i want, uh you know i want biology or, or biomedical engineering i mean which languages, is that stuff being done in mhm mhm mhm uhuh okay okay i, wasn't really sure what the Classical Civilization, is, about. Classical Civilization is really a course in, um, cultural history, mhm mhm mm  mhm   mhm mhm uhuh mhm i think i'd probably wanna go with Great Books yeah, about ninety percent of the students do. mhm  no i won't okay, do you know where you're living? i'm up on North Campus. oh, okay. so, if you do decide on Great Books and it sounds like you're going to, um tomorrow let's_ tonight in fact ask the um peer advisors mhm mhm uhuh alright okay? mhm so do you have any questions for me? um, i don't know, i was wondering if, whether, like what kind of classes i should be taking should i take like math or chemistry  mhm  mhm right mhm yeah that's not me   uhuh oh you don't really like it. no. i'm not really ooh alright yeah. it comes pretty easy to me, but i don't know. (alright) well you may wanna think about whether you wanna do, Honors Math or mains- or just a regular, mhm mhm what about one-fifty-six? one-fifty-six is fine for people who have A-P credit for one-fifteen. uhuh no mhm   mhm okay so, you think i should go with like, either the Great Books or the Classical Civilization, right probably,  uhuh. so i do the inorganic, chemistry this semester? right right okay mhm uh this, no no, this is yours okay alright alright? now, this evening you're gonna go, as i said you're gonna go to the, to the computer classroom, mhm okay okay? mhm it was very nice meeting you. nice meeting you too. good. i'll see you tomorrow okay bye bye bye 	1
DIS175JU081.json	okay um, couple things i'm just trying to, tell you what's gonna, go on next week. keep you ahead um, you know that the exam is, coming up again the second exam on the twenty-first. please print out the exam that's in the coursepa- or on the uh, website. you should be able by now to probably do half of it at least okay? um, there's a huge, area of Meselson-Stahl's experiment, that was nonmultiple choice last semester that could help you um, and i think, if you get a head start on it you'll be better off. um, we're gonna be doing the, Sordaria lab on Tuesday. you will probably wanna read ahead, on that um, because he's not gonna be discussing that in lecture prior. and then you'll also have a five-point, assignment, i will probably give you something like, chromosomes are at two-N equals six please draw them in this stage this stage this stage etcetera. okay so that's, one more little five-point assignment that you'll be getting. Thursday you'll have another quiz okay? we wouldn't wanna let you uh, sleep or anything. and that will be over what he does next which, i believe is transcription and translation and will, also be over the Sordaria lab. and today, um we're gonna end with a quiz so you guys will have a chance to ask any questions that you might have and i'm ending with the quiz because, we're gonna do the chromosome dance which i think will help you, for the quiz, prior to that hopefully. but, uh before that, i wanna go over a couple things that you need, before, we actually, start the chromosome dance. and that, involves genetic recombination, and what does recombination mean? if i say, there's recombination, Meagan? isn't that when the chromosomes overlap? could be that's called what? crossing over okay, crossing over. and when does that occur? meiosis. which phase?   mutations? okay mutation. but something naturally occurring with the chromosomes. a mixture of the, paternal, per- paternal, genes. okay, good. uh i just wanna illustrate that for you. i'll use the same alleles that we used, on Tuesday. pairing  hap- haploid appearance okay they're haploid. that was right. and they also look like, the parents, the original, parents. and we call these parentals, for obvious reasons okay. variation okay, variation and that'll become important for evolution down the road. okay? okay. so that's independent assortment, understand that you can get, recombination through independent assortment. um, alternatively, we could show crossing over okay? and what that would look like, is let's say, you had a, reciprocal exchange between, the A gene on, chromatids two and three okay? what that would look like, do you happen to have any copies of that? no i'll go, i'll go get one though. cuz mine's, mine's filled in and that would be cheating. um, so try to fill these out. i'll go get you a copy and, we'll go around the room. and what i want_ how i want this to run is, let's say Joel says generates two diploid cells from a diploid. and he says meiosis one if that's wrong jump on him, okay and tell him why that's wrong okay? and, you guys, figure it out and let, each other know what's wrong versus me telling you. okay. so try that. i'll be right back. i don't' know if you wanna pause it or not. somebody's in the lost and found. okay so it's okay if i write on it? yeah it's from last semester so i don't think they're gonna come back. mhm is it the same thing? hm? no, no. i don't have my book either. you don't. you can make two. this is discussion you guys you're supposed to have this. somebody stole mine you have no excuse. i don't even know i don't even remember (xx) i don't care. you're supposed to be prepared for class each and every day. what happened to the (xx)  okay who else...? actually just use this and you can just write in the book. thanks. that's just, cuz there're hardly any men in here. you guys ready? yeah yes okay. how about if we start with Erin, and just go, around the room, read your question and then, say what you think. and if you think Erin's wrong or, anyone's wrong, um, tell 'em. i got a question real quick. can it be um, more than, yeah yeah okay?  what do you start with though, in meiosis two? haploid. right. mkay so you, end with haploids too. so, just mitosis. everybody, agree on that? mhm okay so remember, you have to start out diploid in meiosis, but after meiosis one you have two daughter cells that're haploid already. mkay? those two daughter cells, undergo a further reduction division to produce four haploids. okay? uh- okay she sounds confident. yeah uh everybody agree? no i put meiosis two. no? okay somebody thinks it's also meiosis two? no no, (that creates) four. okay Maria's right. um, you get two haploid cells from a diploid cell. why isn't it, meiosis two? you get four and what do you start with? haploid. haploid okay you start with a haploid. remember, it's diploid at the beginning, then haploid haploid. mkay? so it's just meiosis one. um, mkay, everybody agree with that? mitosis mitosis. okay mitosis. remember that haploids can undergo mitosis as well so don't forget that, you start out haploid you make two haploids. and, you have  is it both of 'em or just mitosis? uh both of them. mitosis and meiosis two... yep? so like, how would, if by mitosis, which kind of cells like wouldn't be the diploid cuz you know how, like how could it be a diploid anyhow, for mitosis? um, okay remember the, the drawings that i gave? let's just say_ i'll just use, two alleles. well like for, uh um, prokaryote it would be like two haploid cells right? where, it just, the difference from like, i- yeah it doesn't necessarily have to be prokaryotic, on fungus, there are many fungus that are haploid all their lives, like Sordaria is. but if you picture_ okay this is a haploid let's just say it has one chromosome, okay. and it can, go through, mitosis. mhm is that for one and two? sorry? is that for one and two, just haploid, for meiosis one and two? um well thi- this was, wait where are we here? two haploids from a haploid. so that's mitosis and meiosis two. okay? okay.  anybody agree, disagree? disagree disagree disagree why? meiosis one. okay meiosis one. you don't have homologous chromosomes at meiosis two anymore remember because the homologues have separated out, and meiosis two is similar to mitosis. mkay? so the, homologues don't pair anymore. so it's just meiosis one. um, okay anybody wanna add anything to that? mitosis mitosis. okay. so remember sister chromatids will g- separate, during anaphase. they won't, during meiosis one anaphase one, okay? but they do, in meiosis two anaphase two. okay um, and why might they not be identical? um cuz they might have different alleles. from how? crossing over mkay. good. everybody agree with that? meiosis one and meiosis two you might have, nonidentical, Katrina? when does crossing over occur? prophase one meiosis one. mkay?  uh, um yeah they they could be iden- if no crossing over occurs sure, they could be identical i- i mean, i- actually it could be all three, as long as no crossing over no recombination occurs. but you know they're identical, absolutely in mitosis for sure. okay there's never any crossing over in mitosis. okay. um, mkay. everybody agree with that? that you have, replication the S-phase prior to mitosis and meiosis one. no. why's this? why isn't it in mitosis, i mean (meiosis two?) why what? why not be be, okay think of what you end up with after meiosis, one. you end up with, haploids. mitosis and meiosis one so, the answer is, mitosis and meiosis one? right. oh okay uh, mkay. is there anybody, disagree? wants to admit it? no? okay.  wanna take something back? um, not meiosis two. mkay, yeah just meiosis one. why can't it occur, during meiosis two? cuz they don't have homologous chromosomes. right, there's only one copy they're haploid then there's no ho- homologue to, pair with and cross with okay.  okay. nobody would disagree with that right since you just learned about nondisjunction, uh yeah yeah does everybody like that? centromeres don't (divide?) no, centromeres don't divide remember? why don't they? cuz isn't it the whole chromosome though? why? spindle attached to the wrong side. right, the spindle fiber's only attached on one side of the chromosome, whoever, asked that, so they can't it just pulls, one chromosome that way and one, the other way. unless, nondisjunction occurs okay?  okay. both with mitosis and meiosis one because they're l- i'm sorry two because they're lining up, single file. um, okay. everybody agree with that? mhm Rebecca.  mkay sematic cells is mitosis. so, sex cells whoa.  mkay, meiosis one and two, are for sex cells.  and what? meiosis two. we're talking the, the very original parent. (mhm) meiosis is, haploid. right? anyone wanna help her out? meiosis has to start out diploid why? mm so it can breed and cover one another because it can't replicate within meiosis. right you have to have a homologous pair, okay? so you have to have two of each, so you have to at least have some, i don't know some, uh multiple, of two. so, i'm just trying to get to the final answer, why, why it's not meiosis two. if it starts out diploid what're your four products of meiosis? what's the pro- the ploidy of your four, end products of meiosis two. they're haploid they're haploid right. so can they be identical to the, original parent? no. they   okay um, mkay? everybody agree? okay. i  yeah, if you're a germ cell and you're gonna become a sex cell, you undergo meiosis. mkay, if you're another type of cell in the body you undergo mitosis. right so they never go through, like all three. um actually germ cells do. li- okay picture this. a sperm and an egg, come together fertilization occurs, you have a single, diploid zygote okay it's a single cell, it's diploid. somehow you have to, grow into a multi-cellular being, that includes the germ cells. so mitosis occurs in each of, you know skin cells nerve cells germ cells. and the germ cells s- starts out diploid. okay? and then when it's going to become a sperm or an egg, it goes through meiosis. but the germ cell's the only one that will go through both. okay we don't wanna leave you guys out. um, Katrina, why is it important to, oh my, i don't understand the question. um, it's right there, the crucial difference between mitosis and meiosis, is encapsulated by the statement mitosis is a mechanism for constancy okay? so, if you have a liver cell, why is it important to make more, liver cells? why do you want, identical, an identical clone of cells? um anyone wanna help? constancy? for the purpose of regeneration like for instance with your skin. okay. Bridget's saying for regeneration obviously if you want a skin cell you want that same clone of skin cells you, you don't want it mutated so it's an abnormal skin cell. um you don't want a liver cell growing in place of it so you wanna turn genes on, that're going to express liver, proteins or whatever to make a liver cell, and turn those off that don't mkay? versus, Rasheda, why would you want, diversity in meiosis? why is diversity so important? for when you go, later on down, with it n- the gene- uh, it'll become, it'll be more important later on down the, evolution okay, so, for evolutionary purposes right. if everything was the same, there'd be nothing for natural selection to act on, okay? um, and we're gonna, start getting into, natural selection, pretty soon, pretty much after exam number two mkay? okay Joel. does chance play a role in either mitosis or meiosis? meiosis. mkay. and, how? how is there chance? recombination, crossing over nondisjunction. mkay? crossing over nondisjunction or just independent assortment. just the random role of about lining up chromosomes mkay during, metaphase. okay, um this is a real good test for you guys to take again and, like right before the exam, it should_ if you can just answer these questions cold and don't have to, to look up in your notes, you should be pretty well prepared for the exam as long a- as you can draw things, mkay? um, okay, hopefully this will help with the quiz as well this little chromosome dance simulation. um, basically this is set up to illustrate, human chromosomes. you guys are gonna be human chromosomes we're gonna start with four unreplicated, human chromosomes, and then, you're gonna duplicate yourselves, mkay? and, i've got some alleles here. being sort of sex biased, i have big-B, being bad breath little-B being fresh. big-C being crabby, little-C being cheerful. and, i don't need four, men with bad breath, that're crabby. but, my, male, sperm, is going to carry an allele for bad breath, and a and a separate allele, for the crabby gene mkay? notice that these are unduplicated chromosomes at the time. and also notice, that, fertilization's going to occur, you guys should be able to take these chromosomes through, both mitosis and meiosis and understand what happens so it's going to be up to the, individual alleles to move the way you should. and the rest of you watch the way they're moving, and if they're doing something wrong let 'em know. mkay. alright. um, throughout_ first we're gonna do mitosis which is, is pretty easy, and then we'll, go to meiosis so, what i need, is four volunteers i need, bad breath, mkay who wants to, be the bad breath allele? crabby, okay stand up please. okay the hands are gonna represent, chromatids and, these sticky notes don't stick too well but, here's her crabby allele, okay. whose got bad breath? besides me because i had onions for lunch. okay... bad breath. uh who wants to be cheerful? nobody? man i will be, okay. Leslie's cheerful. i can feel it. um, fresh breath, (i can't believe we're doing this.) okay Meagan. wait, wait come on Nana says she will. Nana will. those of you that don't volunteer now get to do meiosis and it's much harder, okay? uh bad breath. so that's alright. e- everybody alright. okay i need a crabby and a cheerful. okay Rebecca. does it matter if we're, against the wall? it doesn't matter. just as long as you can see the, they can see the signs. okay what's going on in prophase of mitosis? anybody. four things. random. okay it's random, what else...? chromosomes (xx) well that  okay they're condensed. you can see 'em, you can see 'em, you can see 'em under the scope. okay what else? um, spindle fibers form. spindle fibers form. okay. uh what else? centromeres go to the opposite sides of the cell. centrosomes  nuclear envelope disappears. nuclear envelope disappears. okay. are you guys just at random in the nucleoplasm? or are you paired? are you just there? random we're just, there. okay you're just there. okay these are the prophase chromosomes. alright, let's get into metaphase... okay are they right? is that right? uh'uh they're haploid (in appearance?) it's the same as the parents. identical they're identical to each other and the parent. right. you guys are not only identical to each other, you're identical to the original parent. what's your ploidy? diploid. two-N two-N equals, four you want these? yeah. these are for my next, batch of volunteers. okay, meiotic chromosomes same thing, i need nope. that girl don't know nothing. okay. we need four more. and i have these... okay. this is meiosis. so sperm separate from the egg please. go ahead, no that's alright crabby, now who else am i missing? Laury, is this the part where the, the chromosomes are replicating themselves, when they find a partner?  um, wh- when i say partner wha- what's going on now is, semi-conservative replication where, the helicase comes in unwinds brings in all that stuff, brings in the bases. when, when the homologous chromosomes find a partner, that's when like chromosomes pair. so there will be_ watch this okay. alright, we're in prophase one now. so what should be going on? condensing, condensing you're condensed. spindles nuclear envelope is gone now oh homa- homologous, chromosomes pair okay homologous chromosomes pair so do it. it's up to you to figure out who's homologous... what does homologous mean? the same. carrying the same genes right? so i have the breath gene, whether it's bad or good. and have i- the mood gene whether it's bad or good those are homologues. okay so cheerful is paired with crabby, fresh is paired with bad, okay? now, typically you guys are so close together, that there's h- you can't even distinguish between, the four of you. i won't make you do that yet. yes. i got a question. okay. mhm she wouldn't have a spindle fiber, just oh Bridget does too. yeah i was just using the front row. yeah Bridget would have one, and Joel would have one but in between poor Jerry, Bryant no. okay. okay so anaphase one. okay, since these four had no spindle fiber, are we staying? i mean i'll stay but you know in the middle don't they stay? no   oh okay and that's because of the, what's that? spindle fiber, spindle fiber? kinetochore. no kinetochore. oh you, you have a kinetochore. but, it's on his side though. no your kinetochore is here.  it it can't it's, just staying on his side yeah cuz you guys were so close together that there's no room for  right right. centromeres haven't divided okay so like the centromeres are even attached to the kinetochores on, each chromosome right right. yep. everybody has a kinetochore. that's not the problem, okay the problem is the spindle fiber attachment. okay, so, meiosis one would occur, be over. telophase, one cytokinesis one and you'd end up with two daughter cells. how do they look? those daughter cells? what alleles do you guys have? identical to their parents. oh you guys ended up identical but it didn't have to be that way did it? uh'uh, no no cuz Brian and Joel could've been over here, Jerry and Bridget could've been over there and then they would look, recombinant right? what's their ploidy? two-Ns two-N four-N equals eight ahh. no, two-N what is_ whose, ploidy? this whole cell like this? this whole cell and this whole cell. two-N equals four. two, one-N is that one-N equals two? how many, mood genes, mood, chromosomes do you have? one how many, breath chromosomes do you have? oh i keep thinking it's_ oh i know what you're talking about now. so one-N equals two? one-N equals two. and that's because the centromere didn't divide, yeah i forget. separate different? different, because they have half the genetic information as the original unreplicated parent, and it just so happens that they all lined up together so we don't really have any, recombinants per se here but we could've because it's random, okay? now if you'll just get back together with your, homologue one more time i'm just wanna show, crossing over. get back where, metaphase one. okay now i want just Jerry and Bryant, to cross over so just, swap tags. yeah or swap sides whichever you wanna do. what're you gonna do man? God, it's not that hard. okay, um, anaphase one... okay, cytokinesis you're, haploid. okay, now just go through meiosis two show me, the end products of meiosis two. okay good. now Natasha and Joel have bad breath and they're crabby. mkay. that looked just like dad, right? mkay, um, Loretta has bad breath, but Bryant's cheerful. is that parental or, recombinant? recombinant. okay that's recombinant, mkay? Felicia has, fresh breath, Jerry's crabby, parental or recombinant? recombinant. recombinant. and then Bridget's, cheerful, and, Naomi's got fresh breath so, those were parental. okay? i think you can visualize what would happen with nondisjunction. okay? if you'll all get back together one more time with your homologues. okay, nondisjunction, we're gonna have, Brian and Jerry separate but we're gonna have Felicia and Naomi come over here. okay? okay. so now, poor, Jerry and Bridget are gonna die because they are gonna be but we have Down's syndrome but that's okay. um, so these guys, fertilization's going to occur, right? we'll just call you an egg, fertilization's going to occur. and now i have, bad breath. okay? so there's three of us, and my homologue does too. now we have three, alleles for bad breath, and, therefore it's called a trisomy for three. and, that's not too devastating we just go with, bad breath for the rest of our lives okay? but that's nondisjunction where somebody ends up with none. okay and somebody ends up with, one. does it matter that he's still um, i mean, like had a crossover? no. no that's fine. you can have, you know nondisjunction with crossing over, whatever. okay thank you chromosomes you did an excellent job so, hopefully try to visualize that cuz you guys seem to know what you're doing. and if you can visualize what's supposed to be happening that's sometimes helpful for, the exam. but first for the quiz, okay? you know what's on it. there's all the uh, cricket lab, cricket lab's on it um, D-N-A replication Meselson-Stahl the experiments where she chased Avery-Griffith mitosis meiosis. um, what's the ploidy af- after meiosis, one? what's what? the, ploidy after meiosis one? okay after meiosis one, what is the ploidy? one-N equals, eight one-N equals thirty okay... uh the question is what's the ploidy after meiosis one? one-N equals two. one-N could've equal any, one-N could equal ten. oh okay. how many genes are on one, chromosome? typically about a hundred. mkay and that's sort of a ball, hundred hundred and fifty, that's kind of a ball park, figure for how many genes are on chromosome. yeah and, and one thing we've done is we've just done unlinked genes, but keep in mind you could have A-B-C-D, that're all linked, and crossing could occur at any point, on the, chromatids. so, you may see crossing over with respect to one locus but not the other, twenty-three. mkay. so then N represents the copy of each, chromatid? chromosome. chromosome. yeah. don't even use chromatids in this class cuz it'll, confuse you i think more than anything. just know, this a, chromosome, that's unreplicated, this is a chromosome, that is replicated. okay. okay. Meagan? so when we're doing the, the diploid, then, or like just whatever the ploidy, you go by the letters like, so if it's A and A, even whether they're large or small then that's considered like, one kind. right. mhm then it's still two-N. it's still two-N? yeah okay what's the ploidy of this cell? three-N equals i knew you'd say that. it's wrong? oh   what's important about the crickets lab? oh, well you should be able to put any of the, substrates with any of the enzymes and tell me what would happen. Laury, it's just like i can't remember exactly what those substrates did. i can't even remember their names. that was the first exam you can get,  glycolysis. glycolysis. in order for glycolysis to happen, where does it happen what do you need? cytosols cytosol. so if i put, glucose with whole homogenate. could glycolysis happen? yes.  yes. oh, i remember that. does everybody understand why both those processes could occur? yes. did anybody say no? okay? okay. glucose, yes why? because the cytosol okay. so glycolysis occur could respiration? no. why not? no mitochondria no mitochondria. okay. you know this. no. why not? no cytosol. no cytosol. could respiration? yes, no no? why? because don't you have to (go through) glycolysis before you can go to respiration? yeah, yeah. if you don't have pyruvate, or succinate which is a pyruvate substitute then you can't go through respiration so this tube could do nothing. no. why? because there's no glucose no glucose, any respiration? yes. okay. okay succinate, plus supernatant. glycolysis? yes, no. why not? cuz there's still no glucose right? no glucose, respiration? no no, no mitochondria. no mitochondria, okay so, nothing there. and lastly, succinate, plus pellet. glycolysis? no no. respiration? yes. yes. you said pyruvate is a, glucose, substitute? pyruvate. wait i'm sorry? what is pyruvate, a substitute for? succinate, is a pyruvate substitute. okay. mhm. alright? you're good with everything you're ready, bring it on, no no, the experiments oh no. i told you. let's have a summary of all of 'em. no okay, um, experiments, anything specific? Griffith's was the S-cells and the R-cells. okay  the rats right? yeah you inject the mouse with S-cells they die why? cuz they had pathogenic they had a capsule around it mkay. cont- contracts pneumonia and dies. basically.   no no. does the mouse die with it?   breaks up the capsules breaks open the cap- breaks up the capsule basically destroys the cell wall so it's just naked D-N-A, in solution. and what happens to the mouse? it lives. okay it lives nothing's wrong with it. so alone, live R didn't kill the mouse. alone, heat-killed S doesn't kill the mouse, why does a combination of the two kill the mouse? cuz transformation okay transformation occurs and what di- what's being transformed to what? the S and R R is transferring to S mkay, so, basically, something from the S is getting into R, transforming it to becoming S, and killing the mouse. did they conclude anything more than that? no. no. okay? and then it took Avery, what'd Avery do? to a purified solution? he took the chemicals  okay you take D-N-ase, mkay that kills D-N-A. and if D-N-ase wipes out the D-N-A do you see transformation occurring? no no. what about protease that kills the protein? it still transforms mkay. still transforms, and therefore what did, Avery conclude? the D-N-A was the uh, transforming agent mkay, D-N-A is the transforming principle and not protein. and, protein's so much more complex. there're twenty amino acids there're various ways, millions of ways to hook 'em up. so it was disputed, pretty heavily, debated that uh, D-N-A which is much more simple could be, that important for the genetic material. okay. okay? 	1
INT425JG001.json	i think he's getting more comfortable    uhuh yeah mhm uhuh yeah uhuh uhuh right  mhm... yeah yeah okay, okay this this is the topic okay, sorry I didn't get the chance to grope around like  no it's okay... it's... i know for you it's a hectic time of the year yeah mhm  yeah, um, but, not a- certainly not any longer okay yeah okay. this is a definite second time okay so, y- you wanted to make sure that he knew, that you were, seriously considering not doing it.  mhm   yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah okay  mhm okay okay  mhm yeah, yeah  um, yeah, tell me, where you're from okay um, i'm from Pennsylvania  uhuh urbed yeah uhuh mhm and so did Jack i take it yes, um yes actually it was pretty funny. um, i was a year ahead of him mhm mhm uhuh yeah mhm wow mhm yeah  mhm yeah, so so that was really neat   right  nineteen ninety uhuh mhm really? uhuh  i see mhm   yeah mhm yeah that is amazing, i w- i would have guessed that maybe you had... sort of known each other's plans... before he came here but no it was just a surprise that's quite funny well what'd you do between um i um, actually i have a resume here i didn't oh yeah  can i have this? yeah yeah? yeah great um, i, worked for two different environmental consulting companies. uhuh uhuh uhuh mhm mhm uhuh mm yeah yeah uhuh yeah mhm yeah mhm  so you're- you were here and she was in school? um i was looking for a job consulting and the market was pretty bad so i didn't find anything so i ended up working in a bookstore uhuh, yeah,  oh yeah well, that's great yeah, it certainly helps i can, get some of my textbooks there yeah, yeah. so where did you work sh- uh um Webster's Books it's uhuh yeah yeah that's (xx) Plymouth Road Traver yes yeah, so i live right behind that mhm hm' yeah mhm good yeah well um... what uh, what prompted you to, come to graduate school? um, it's something i, i... kinda always wanted to do, um or had been thinking about and then sciences, um my degree is in biology and environmental studies mhm uhuh yeah   mhm yeah right, right. so the project that you're_ that you guys are, embarking on now is more in line with the kinds of things you, it sounds like maybe, tha- the kind of direction you'd like to be moving in mhm i think so um i mean i certainly, learned a lot and i think a lot of it's useful, um... (xx) what what i'd learned from consulting. mhm  yeah yeah  mm  yeah, seems like more and more modern, um, land use, questions are gonna be like that mhm, i think so already have been for a long time, and not in, other more intensely populated places but for us that feeling that, we're kinda running out of room to just just,  mhm yeah yeah before you could (xx) things could just, grow until uhuh  yeah mhm yeah yeah, um, how do you feel about your educational experience at Michigan, um so far. uh um... i think there's there's some good things and there's some things that you know i wish were a little different. mhm mhm yeah yeah right mhm yeah uhuh uhuh  uhuh yeah mhm what's been most valuable to you? um mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah  yeah right  mhm mhm uhuh yeah yeah neat it's the kind of insight that could really affect your thinking through your whole career and i_ yeah mhm. and i just_ i was thinking about it the other day. um, at Saint Lawrence i took a course on fluvial geology. uhuh  right mhm mhm yeah yeah yeah  right yeah, it is, and and also how um... how inexplicable in a way it is when somebody manages to really like shift the, thinking in a whole field mhm  yeah mhm yeah yeah mhm  yeah yeah right   yeah then you also sort of recognize a role for yourself in your profession then, mhm mhm  yes mhm (xx) yes yeah um, uh i guess um Nell my fiancee, mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah mhm yeah mhm  mhm  yeah yeah yeah i think it's a- i think it's really rich, mhm mhm right mhm  yeah mhm mhm mhm yeah yeah  yeah yeah so you get kind of a closed loop. mhm um i think we just, just through the master's, um planning course  mhm  uhuh mhm  yeah. yeah. okay. um, a w- uh at this what do you think you can contribute to the group? um... i think... i have um, besides my, sorta biology background um, i mean i can certainly contribute that (but,) my work experience, um, yeah mhm yeah right yeah yeah uhuh so how's that working out so far? um pretty well, um... they think at at times... i don't know i mean i think it it's helping the group. i i i hope it's not frustrating people. um, i get frustrate- frustrated sometimes a little at mhm uhuh um i know you... uh, y- you sent a message   yeah mhm okay, and then we talked about it with Pedro the next time we met and, mhm yeah  mhm mhm  yeah right right  mhm  um... i don't think so i mean and there's, you know every time you get people together you're gonna go off on a tangent  right   yeah, how about the burden to you because you have been, kind of the um... the_ y- you've been the     i don- it hasn't been, a burden really mhm  yeah mhm  right  yeah, okay um ho- how about the uh roles of other people in the group? cuz you've been kind of the uh minder  um i think, Jack and i have been sharing sort of that little uhuh  yeah it was about the roles of the other people in the group okay um so what do you see so far what do you see their contributions as? what kinds of contributions have they been making? um, i think i think everybody's been making, good contributions  mhm  mhm mhm   yeah mhm right mhm right mhm mhm right  mhm yeah he's really thrown himself into the thick of it hasn't he?   i i can't imagine he's, taking he's taking six classes this semester yeah  uhuh yeah mhm mhm yeah yeah right, it is, he does all that and um with a- kind of a, spirit of adventure, i mean he's_ he doesn't seem beleaguered you know mhm  yeah oh that's that's great yeah mhm yeah mhm yeah mhm    mhm mhm yeah right yeah, yeah it is 	1
LES365JG029.json	in uh, your interest i'd like to mention that we are in fact uh uh, quite a bit ahead of our schedule, uh that means one or the other either you could talk more, and uh slow us down, you you mean you're gonna pass those out before Friday? yeah, yeah. (i see) well one of the things i um uh, did not cover or uh zipped by on Monday morning, is the matter of the literature. uh, i postponed that uh, to the point, uh where um, i i've heard questions uh now from quite a number of people, where do you find information on this or that? i've got a product, that's not working so well, how do i know, uh what materials work better than the ones we've got right now. well, um, we don't know. and uh, there again you kinda wonder if uh you know if uh if if i've really been uh diligent in these forty years, why don't i know? uh it's because the subject i say isn't so complicated, but, you know, when you're looking for a w- uh uh a solution to a problem and you're looking perhaps for a different material, or a different lubricant, um, you you you expect that there may be one out there now, can you trace, can you go back in your mind as to why you expect, that there's a solution laying out there somewhere. hm...? well, isn't it because, uh, very often, we have things that break, and the answer to things that break, is to find a stronger material. simple, hm a good connection there? or, we've got a material that, um uh that fatigues, or buy a material that doesn't fatigue as as as readily you know that sort of thing. uh or you might get into certain nuances you know relating to residual stresses so forth and so forth, you know that, the majority of us, are are are well steeped in mechanics, aren't we? and in mechanics or the mechanics ethic, leads us to to suppose, that uh there are materials out there that satisfy, a need, but now, what's wrong with that? from his point of view yeah. uh, and uh, so you know one aga- one uh uh again um, uh expects a relationship with a consultant just like you would with uh with uh might i say simpler, problems? you know if you've got a corrosion problem, uh, a corrosion consultant can point you, the way fairly quickly. and likewise in the metallurgy problem but w- wear, uh y- y- it's very hard to point the way, and you've gotta work a while, and where i have succeeded uh in in consulting, and uh where as you see it uh Vern Wedeven has succeeded, it's when you're taken inside of the problem for a while, now my inclination generally, is i'm inside the problem for a day or two, then i say, you know, there's a guy at Penn State, that knows this topic better than i. why don't you call him. and then i can help describe the problem and so forth so on, and expand uh you know the, kind of thi- the, the the database, uh, or, uh let's do some tests. but not at the university. the tests at the university will be on a pin-on-disc machine, which doesn't tell you, very much you know? let's do some tests in the company, with the people, in the company, and when that is done the intelligence is is it is embedded in the people in the company where it belongs, it doesn't get farmed out to the university, the interface between universities and external research groups and the sponsoring industry, is uh uh well it's a it's a rather high resistance interface. it's hard to transmit information from outside to inside, of a problem that has so many, uh almost, um, uh subjective nuances, that people in the company, have got to be deeply involved in the in the in the uh investigation. well alright that doesn't mean you, don't, look in the literature, now, early on or in the in the first part of the book, there's a mention of, the literature, there are many journals, and i get most of them, uh, and there are many books and i've got uh probably nine-tenths of the available books, of substance now there's a little su- a little you know, uh, uh subjective sort of evaluation, but uh, what are the what are these books well i i you know i can mention here, Elsevier, has a tribology series and here's a very gripping title, Materials, for Research, written by a very competent guy Bill Glaeser at Battelle, now, Battelle, or Glaeser is a, uh, metallurgist, and he describes all the metallurgical types of failure that happen, and uh, this is a helpful thing to read. it's a lengthy thing to read, whether you can derive something in one reading, uh, i- i- is uh you know something for you to judge i wanna pass these around, um, there are, uh, as i say many books there's this tribology series there's about thirty of them by now, to look into, uh there are, the professional society journals, the A-S-L-E now called Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers, p- turns out the Tribology Transactions. here's a journal of, very high quality, that is to say they, are quite careful, to accept only, good papers... they rejected mine three years ago,  sometimes. certainly you have less tendency to scuffing... so that's the friction in marginal lubrication, next we have the wear, in marginal lubrication... uh how fast do these materials wear, uh when um in various uh types of lubrication? in figure nine two we have three curves. three lines, line A is for, inert substances line B is for mineral oil and line C is for commercial grade, engine oil, now we use these three, uh oils or, environments, in our work, as uh uh easy ways to get certain effects. but first of all let's say, that line A, has been predicted by um, uh considerations of elasto- hydrodyn- cont- uh elastohydrodynamics and contact, mechanics. um, uh Tallian of S-K-F Bearing Company, uh uh very, uh sharp contact mechanics guy, says that, uh you've got rough surfaces well everybody says that, uh, some of these bumps are higher than others you know statistically, uh now if you've got a uh, uh an adequate film thickness there, none of the asperities are in a state of high stress. but if you increase the load or decrease the viscosity of the lubricant in here, um, your calculations will tell you that you could get a thinner film. and uh, now if that thinner film is thinner, than the height of these asperities then you could say well, some of these then must be making contact with each other, and i'll you know you just have to imagine these are touching, uh they're making contact with each other, and uh, uh, more of these will make contact with each other as that film gets thinner and thinner. so, uh Tallian comes up with a load sharing idea, that the thinner the film, the less the load will be carried on a fluid film and the more it will be carried on asperities, then he says that, any loads carried on asperities, is subject to the considerations of you know of dry wear or something like that the Archard type of wear. hm? that if you've got, minute, areas of contact, you're gonna have wee little bits of wear, if you've got several regions of of contact, you're gonna have more wear, or what happened is uh uh c- uh uh Tallian's final calculation is curve A, uh that is the amount of wear one would get, that's on a log scale you notice, that's the amount of wear one would get, uh uh as a function of lambda. when the lambda is three and over, ah i should have mentioned that earlier too you know lambda is the ratio, of uh H over sigma, sigma you recall is a statistical quantity, and uh, when you deal with a statistical quantity, let's say you've got an R-A of ten, likely there will be, uh a good number of them also at height fifteen, some at twenty fewer at twenty-five but some also at thirty, and this is kind of the uh the the range that people take, uh that um a lambda of one may have asperities that are three times as high, as your average. and so you see the Tallian curve starts at about three, well that's carefully crafted to come out that way i did it on my own Macintosh, uh but if you look in uh Tallian's article it does come out that way, so then as lambda gets smaller and smaller, the, load carried by asperities increases, and the wear then should increase, uh in the same uh uh uh in the same way. is it true? does it happen? well in order to, in order to check this out, you've gotta test this, uh you know hypothesis in a neutral atmosphere. why a neutral atmosphere? the assumption is that when there's contact you've got adhesion, and adhesion can come about if you don't have, uh oxides. alright? so, our way of doing that, is to use, vacuum pump oil, um, uh diffusion pump oil which is a silicone, and it has no gas in it. uh uh unless you you know leave the bottle open and shake it or something like that but as you buy it there's no gas in vacuum pump oil it's a silicone fluid, then you, you know on our machine that we had here, you pour some of that on the specimen, and then we put a plastic bag around it and blowed nitrogen through there, and we've got an iner- iner- inert atmosphere as inert as uh as you needed you don't have to have a vacuum. in my younger days i always pumped up a vacuum but now we can get it much more, cheaply, with just a bag of nitrogen. alright, then using that inert atmosphere, we got a wear rate that followed curve A. uh Tallian is vindicated, i believe in that, uh load sharing concept, well, we did another experiment, then with laboratory grade mineral oil, and that always has some entrained air, uh in it and uh, uh something different happens. uh at the uh lambda of three or thereabout there's very little wear, and this curve kind of go- goes up along with A, but then finally peels off at some point. uh well why does it peel off at that point, or what is the meaning of peeling off in the first place? this, surface will function at a, lower lambda ratio, without severe wear. well, that is the case of, um some kind of coating forming on these, uh these these points of uh collision, and uh, those coatings um, well i'll give you the bottom line, those coatings will prevent high, shear stress on that asperity. and we'll mention this two or three times, the the the_ my best explanation of that mechanism, comes out to something this, we know that uh, uh let's just kind of make a couple of uh of asperities here, um, when one slides over the other, uh there is a uh uh likelihood of uh you know some kind of traction being transmitted from one to the other, and we can use our familiar terms when there's a load on that asperity, and there's a uh traction, uh which is uh we we can call F or, F is the force required to overcome that traction, and we're familiar that uh with these terms that that is F over W, and um, um, now from mechanics, we know a few things that, backing up to a simple normal load, the first plastic flow happens there, and then with increased normal load there's gonna be uh a larger and larger plastic field, now if we instead of or in addition to W have a, finite value of F applied, the point of first plastic flow moves out and finally appears at that surface, when mu is about point-three. on this asperity. well uh on that asperity that's different i want to reiterate, that's different from a uh coefficient of friction that one measures over a large surface. because we're talking here about very remote little spots, each of these might have a coefficient of friction, of, point-five point-six point-seven or something like that, and it might not it probably would not be detectable by, the measurement of the overall friction of the system, because the rest of this area is so large compared to those little dots, and we've got fluid, shearing, over every place else, and we might have solid adhesion, in those minute spots, but there are too few to measure. and we, have uh we've done this many many times, we know that in scuffing tests, in our machines like the one i had here, uh that the coefficient of friction bobbles along like this, so on and so on, eventually that friction goes up as the surface really goes to pot, but if we had in- and we do investigate this look at that surface in detail all along the way, you often find that about two-thirds of the way through final failure, is_ you see the first evidence of, scuffing. scuffing starts, way back there, and you can never detect it by friction measurements, by sound, you know ultrasonic devices, by, temperature by nothing, uh it just is an insidious little force, i suppose like a cancer or something like that, we, how do we detect it? well by, diligent microscopy, we don't of course, take a specimen, and run it at, uh this le- this amount of time, examine it put it back in so on and so on because, whenever you take it out of the uh of the system, it's oxidizing while it's outside of the system, and the situation has changed, uh and you dare not, start from there. so rather, we usually uh put in a specimen one for five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes and so on down the line, and do this often enough until they were reasonably sure, that out here is where the action is, uh in scuff initiation, and uh out here is where the, where the where you get the real evidence. and this, th- this is the point of a lot of discussion at conferences. uh, we, um well you can probably reconstruct the arguments (uh) well enough anyway, when the coefficient of friction on an asperity exceeds three-tenths or some number like that, the plastic flow field comes out, to the surface, and uh begins to, uh, push materials ahead, of the um uh of the upper slider, scuff it forward like that, and uh, that bump is higher than the original bump. hm, on average. how do we know that? make surfaces rub together and just keep rubbing and keep rubbing and keep rubbing, uh and do, surface roughness tracing, uh during those experiments, and you'll see that the surfaces get rougher. and uh, that has to be due to, this sort of mechanism. there's nothing else and there are no other interactions, on the surface, that could make the roughness increase like that, so there it is, alright, uh, so now we got uh uh, uh, oh yes and, and obviously, when little chunks pull out that coefficient of friction must be very high on that surface, uh but somehow or other, when a soft substance forms, and that soft_ if that soft substance produces an asperity coefficient of friction, less than three-tenths, we have uh uh shall we say, arrested the uh uh uh roughening of the surface, and uh in fact you'd probably even get a smoothing of the surface with the coefficient of friction is low enough, and, what was a danger point here, uh has uh now been, uh uh smoothed down, and then here's another danger point and that gets smoothed down so forth and, eventually the sur- the the the surface kind of uh, uh uh those two surfaces are accommodated to each other, well we'll go over this a couple more times, but curve B, uh, follows curve A for a while, and uh then uh peels off, and uh uh looks like it's a protected surface, we don't get an awful lot of_ that's a log scale on the left side, we get a great reduction of, wear, we_ because of the protective action of a film, which in this case is, oxide. a chemical analysis doesn't show anything other than iron and oxygen, mineral oil, uh we get laboratory grade, mineral oil with very low sulfur content, and what we see on the surface uh well, uh you see a sulfur zipping by every now and then but it's predominantly oxide. F-E-three-O-four oxide, which is nice and soft and protective. and this is still done under uh oxygen-free atmosphere? uh no this is done in air. oh that's in air. yeah, done in air and we've worked with dry air and moist air and you get the same results... what happens if you do it in nitrogen? if you do it in nitrogen, after time, the surface uh uh fails. uh, the oxygen is used up on the surface, but you still have uh uh contact and uh, uh oxide gets knocked off, and it doesn't get replenished after some time, and the surface moves toward failure. yes sir, um, one question i have is, as that plastic field moves up and forward, yes  well yeah right now our_ with, direct normal loading it's at the forty-five-degree angle. yeah well yeah there are, a couple of views on that are you acquainted with slip-line fields... in plasticity? very little. very little, yeah you'll_ you know there are there are slip-lines, uh, not always oriented at a forty-five, uh with a large normal force they'll be oriented a little flatter than that, uh or in other words with a lower coefficient of friction they'll be flatter with a higher coefficient of friction they're higher, uh so on, slip-line fields um, uh_ Peter Oxley of Australia and uh Ken Johnson of Cambridge are trying to work this sort of thing out, uh just exactly how does that material flow. hm, i ought to know slip-line fields, i uh took a course in the subject uh, back in eighteen seventy i think it was, does that have to do with the dislocations in a particular  no is there any correlation between uh the failure mode there and the compressive failure, that you might do in, one of these, pencil machines or opposite (xx) where you actually get a number, for the pencil failure, and then there's another number that's higher for the compressive failure. ah i don't think so. i don't think so. no i mean (xx) for the particular material. yeah. no, i don't think so. (xx) uh, um, the uh_ you see we're looking for the failure of asperities, and that involves both normal load and shear load on that asperity, and furthermore we're looking at, repeat, uh events. yeah does that coefficient of point-three, change with uh, different materials? i- ductile materials. yeah is that just uh, steel,  all ductile materials okay all ductile materials. yeah. mhm. at at what point, in the wear, then does any noise begin to be produced? at what point in the in the in the test? yeah if you, started out, with good lubrication and you, slowly, and at what time does noise at what point does noise change? mhm, increase is that at the knee of the curve then? uh knee of which curve? the_ your uh wear rates. oh no. no the_ that's not connected. uh, let's say, those curves there mhm yes so mkay so when you're doing the step test, um, noise is not a good indicator of when you're no no yeah. uh when you're doing the step load test, typically um, you you measure friction uh during during during these uh uh load applications, and when you're measuring friction uh the friction will generally go up you know very much in parallel with the load. so you put on a load and if let's say you put this load on, and if the friction jumps up a tad then settles down, the next time you put on the load you're gonna get failure. usually or something like that you see? if that_ that works if your steps are not too big. uh and_ so then you see when you put this load on you'll get a little bit of a, quivering of the machine. it wants to fail, but it thinks better of it you see, i- is that uh, is that cumulative damage or are you just trying to find the point that_ that two-thirds point where the scuffing actually initiates? uh, it is it is s- s- somewhat of an accumulated failure, uh because you see the length of time that you run these at these steps, matters. uh if you have very short steps you'll probably get failure at a lower load. okay? uh so that accumulated time means something in two ways, that's either an accumulated damage or an accumulated curing. you know healing of damage. in other words the chemistry has time to, to work, to protect uh_ produce a protective film. hm? and if your steps are too short, you don't give it e- ti- enough time to build up a film. none of the area under the, under the curve then, really is uh, uh_ defines failure?  (xx) of the same height so at the same height yeah, okay um where did the carbon come, or go? i mean is the carbon in all these other tests  okay. yeah that's a good point (xx) uh now, then what does that lead you to to guess, that perhaps that high carbon content  you mentioned several things which thing are you asking about? oh i see. we probably don't know as much as you would like to know about it. mean to say we ought to exchange our ignorance sometime or other? we don't always know what's going on. boy i don't either i tell you. alright now, now that we kind of know what forms on the surface, and we're quite sure that it's F-E-three-O-four i mean uh, um, people in uh uh, another car company and uh and one of the suppliers to the other car company hm have favored us with some very thorough analysis, uh and it's uh, uh uh by Auger and other, spectrographic methods are quite sure that it's F-E-three-O-four. and uh in the case of l- liquid_ uh uh oil lubrication and quite sure it's F-E-two-O-three. but we've got a verification of that anyway we've done ellipsometry and we uh see certainly the F-E-two-O-three it stands out like a sore thumb but uh, so obvious in uh ellipsometry. but let's uh take a little look at uh uh something of the dynamics, of this uh sequence of events. it's not enough to know what the chemistry is, what we wanted to then find out was, what surface roughness, what hardness of substrate, what sliding conditions and so on and so on and so on will form this film? because you know there is a com- competition in practical machines. you know that uh a new, uh uh steel part, has only an oxide uh layer on it, and that oxide layer is simply not equal to the task of uh carrying a signif- a significant load. uh, and i think by now we see on the basis of the uh those those curves those three wear rates that uh, with no oxide or oxygen present we're on the way to uh uh a short life or early failure, and so any surfaces that survive you gotta say well there must be some oxygen getting in there to form new oxide. uh and then if we add um uh other things to the oil this stuff must get in there too. so we're faced i think with a um chemical kinetics issue, um new surfaces are on the way to failure from uh the kickoff of the game. how do they survive? or in other words what is the mechanism of break-in of sliding surfaces? most surfaces we deal with are inadequate to the task to start with, how do they end up surviving, if uh they don't have the proper antibodies in them to prevent failure? well i i i portray that in a, certain fashion on the front of the textbook, on the front of the textbook is a graph. and the uh graph is uh_ on the abscissa is time, and uh on the ordinate is something else. well uh, on the ordinate are uh two curves, and one of them is a curve that s- uh uh that shows uh something like this that, a surface, has a a uh uh a tendency to fail as new, and th- when you start rubbing it you are consid- you are already doing some damage to it so a tendency to fail increases with time... it's_ and if you don't do the right thing it's gonna fail. but there's another curve on there that says the capability of the lubricant present, is say down there when you pour that oil into the uh engine or transmission, the capability of that lubricant is not adequate to the task as it starts. you've gotta do some rubbing to get the right thing done. now then you've got to rub, with that oil present so that the capability of the oil catches up with and maybe exceeds the need of the part... this is the break-in time but uh, apparently uh, you know better get at it uh, tis breaktime 	1
LES220SU140.json	and then i'll tell you which, team you're on and which_ the way you're gonna argue in favor of it. it'd be it'd be fun to hear our voices. okay um, this was an article in People that we talked about like, i guess it was two weeks ago now about, when we read, about the little two-year-old who was murdered by two ten-year-old boys in England and um, i'll pass it around i h- highlighted some things with my pen that were, the interesting parts like, um this is anonymity in terms of their names right? right how about their, images, their faces? um um it didn't say, mhm    yeah the initial sentence was for fifteen years of    mhm  cuz cuz wherever they're living, you know let's say they're living in some town somewhere in England, once you publish the photograph anybody in the town that, sees that person on the street is gonna know who they are.  yeah i don't think that they've been, um press has been, granted access to them mhm  it doesn't say in here mhm  mm was that picture staged?   oh it's from a camera?  yeah it um, a mall camera caught one of his killers leading him away. okay. anybody happen to watch Nightline last night? they mentioned that photograph, oh really? yeah i'll pass these around  mhm uh, so in England they wanna do that on a... constant basis have, cameras everywhere. and this piece, last night on Nightline specifically mentioned that photograph, as an example of, police saying there's a value to having cameras (out there.) right. Big Brother. yeah. nope do you have an extra copy? yeah while we're doing this i have a question um, photo essays do they far fall in the same topic as, regular photo journalism? yeah. they're similar to feature, you know they're the photo equivalent of a, feature print story. feature text. so they can be more, atmospheric than a hard news photo. okay Dennis? uh, well the the the th- the article that i found over the weekend was about the um, associa- or American Society of Newspaper Editors, um, with support of sopi- Society of Professional Journalists trying to get, uh copies of the autopsy photos of race car driver Dale Earnhardt's, uh body after he after he was um, killed in a stock car race at the, Daytona Five Hundred. um, part of the background of the story is the other article that i passed out, which talks about uh Teresa Earnhardt's reaction, uh just a few days after the, after the race where she said that she wanted the, medical examiner's records to remain confidential, of course there's the aspect, of (in) photo journalism of, of of of public harm and of course granting public access to aus- autopsy photographs. um, it turns out that Florida has a pretty liberal law regarding uh, autopsy photographs if they're not part of the active criminal investigation so therefore, uh the newspaper editors, uh collectively are going after these documents, the reason is is they want to, hire an independent investigator to determine if there was another reason, why he died, during his car crash, if there was a reason that was contrary to the official finding. um i should also note, as a side bar to these stories is that, it became, also published, or it became known, that, Dale Earnhardt's car there was a question regarding the, safety or the, uh whether he was w- actually wearing a an intact, safet- uh safety belt which would have restrained him. now obviously if you're going two hundred miles an hour in a stock car race and you slam into the wall, you know the odds are k- are heavily against you. but anyway, can i ask you a question? sure go ahead um, wh- what are the unanswered questions, in his, case? cuz, i mean, sh- surely the cause of death is pretty clear isn't it? wh- what questions are there left to ask? well apparently the the newspaper editors, wh- wh- i guess two f- as far as i can see one is the access of the pictures, in order to determine an independent investigation since they were newspaper editors, they felt that under Florida law they had a right to actually get a copy of them. and, evidently they f- uh, as i said before as a as a, news organization they've gotten s- support of S-P-J and other newspaper  mhm mhm is there any posi- possible cause of death? i mean, if you s- you, i saw it on T-V. so, you see just, crash. i mean and he was one of the top, race car drivers right? and so i mean it, so o- i mean obviously   there were a lot of questions about the type of restraints um, what s-    mhm right. i should_ lemme ask l- i just remembered one more thing. part of the other, controversy, quote unquote is the fact that NASCAR is under some heat right now because this is the fourth, race car driver to die in the last nine months, oh mhm mhm  right and as as as a news story i think these these, editors are_ and photo people are looking at this, information as possible, uh information that they'd like to, impart to the public. mhm one of the questions that they were, that, i know that independent sources want to find out is, there's a different helmet that  mhm mhm yep well i don't think the newspapers should be granted access to the photos because um, like basically we live in a morbid society so if one newspaper has them even if they don't publish 'em it's gonna get out, be on the net or something like that, mhm mhm  yeah but    no they want the photos of the   just i, i uh tend to think why is it anybody's business, to see these photos? i mean, the guy is dead, he's a public are they more likely to take steps if the press puts some heat on them? mhm yeah the press has already put heat on 'em they're putting heat on themselves. i don't think it's necessary. well they're obviously not having enough heat put on them because it keeps happening.  showing pictures of a dead body is not gonna put the heat on 'em that's necessary to make the changes though, i mean it's gonna be the reporting on the incident, you know it's th- one photo of a dead_ i mean i i just think that it's, definitely an invasion of privacy, that isn't necessary. Dennis is it clear whether the the any of the newspapers intend to publish this photograph? no in fact they they s- they reported rather clearly as i said before they have, uh their, their intention is to,  have they said we will not publish the photo? or have  right. that's different from saying    it was their attorney who said the photos are important because they might reveal what caused,  mhm mhm i guess another question would be has this happened in the past? and it, has there been an autopsy photo that, news media have obtained access to? you don't happen to know do you? uh not not that you're the expert on this uh, thinking back to who's died recently no. well in the previous crashes well you know you say they keep having all these crashes so the issue must've come up, i remember when this when the, earlier mhm  this this is this, this one here. and he had a crash too didn't he? yeah yeah he crashed (the next) race. was he wearing the the helmet and the restraint (xx) does anybody happen to know? yeah that would be interesting to know. didn't he come in second in the (race then?) no he didn't finish no he didn't finish it it got rained out   well yeah   i just have a problem with them so just blatantly, uh going against what his family wants. i mean i understand that, i mean there are a lot of things in this world that obviously your family wouldn't want to get out like if you're a criminal you know obviously your family is, mhm mhm yeah, there's the danger it will get published, number one number two it's not clear to me i don't know how you feel but it's not clear to me that, having someone look at this photo's    and how is looking at the photo gonna, and,  well i mean isn't a criminal case, different cuz then you know if it could help the police could just go to the  but, if like the court subpoenaed the photograph from the newspaper and then, it doesn't have to be printed but the police can just look at it.    they want the newspapers to get this picture_ cuz it's a little different because it's not newspapers asking for it but, like yeah cuz then like there's such, there's like, such a strong argument for minimizing harm to like, other people in the community who could be like, hurt by the, by the killer as opposed to like minimizing the harm of the family isn't so important then. yeah like what are those rules? like, the greater good of, you know the majority of the people. mhm the needs of the many.  i have a question. yeah wouldn't it make the most sense, this might ruin the whole role play but, wouldn't it make the most sense to have, this first one as the cover and then this one as a side bar showing why,  the top of this, the approval the sixty percent approval, yeah,  right and then have this story as a reason as to why there's some disagreement with him as a side bar as just like a, an offshoot or something th- th- you know a tangent. the the uh, pollution story. right. as a,  okay well you_ that's your team right? you can make that argument. never mind. it's probably better if you do it in secret though because you've just given them, you've tipped your hand to them.  so you now can prepare very powerful arguments against that idea... why don't you guys form up your, subgroups? okay it says uh it says in here that it's it's vice-president Cheney on the first occasion that they mention it but they don't mention it on the first occasion that they men- mention Bush, he's president Bush. and then they refer to, to each of 'em subsequently as misters. yeah   right here it says president    oh the second one? no   first one? presidential debut   yeah but still it's not like it's not his title. you know? because they did that before they were like Mr Bush and then vice-president Gore.  we're arguing semantics here well that's an interesting point but i don't know how relevant it is to, oh it's   n- you're you've gone beyond. how're you guys doing? you   yeah, no contest. oh okay good. and obviously as part of your argument is why you were right, right? yep. absolutely. nope. okay. everybody ready? you guys ready? i think so. okay. why don't you uh face each other, confront each other... unleash your venom. okay so you you guys are the uh, alright we uh, who says you go first? we_ okay you can go first. no no no no go ahead. you're the disadvantaged so (xx) i don't think so. i beg to differ. we conclude that   it's old news,    yeah. actually in above the fold probably in the first three paragraphs of the report you'll see that, he sort of explains why. nope, nope mhm we don't we don't understand why you'd wanna like put that story when it's like old news because like  is the    how is this any different and,  but you're giving  well by putting it on the front page you're you're giving it_ by putting it at all actually no i think         i have a quick time out. oh no wait     something that,  no, the poll,   right but the date on here is the fourteenth the date on here is the thirteenth so   look, were you working on it? i didn't know i'm curious. for my uh,     that means nothing. but but   well the the point is is if this is an E-P-A this is an emissions policy on    well you have environmental groups you have c- c- uh you have Congress debating this topic, um really saying that she would follow the president's lead is kind of, kind of predictory, s- it's sort of uh kind of, normal it's not  it's not saying anything that she's doing except follow the president's lead, and that doesn't,     they're    global warming's a very serious worldwide issue to who? but           yeah and we just came out of one of the closest elections ever and don't you think it's interesting that sixty percent approve of him and that and that certain people don't like, it says here black Americans do not_ i mean don't you wanna like,  it would be  they did. they did not. no they didn't. it hadn't happened yet. i'm still sticking to it. cuz people didn't know about the the reversal until this morning when they opened up the New York Times and saw the poll in there and the, story about the reversal. it's probably gonna be around, fifty-nine percent now. but  plus or minus three.     oh i see.      i think it's im-   hey we're no we're talking about like, this whole  well i'm just saying that not   no it no well, no it doesn't. it really doesn't it just says, this is what he did. and then it says why he did it. and it lets you draw your own conclusion.     and the the the economy thing, i think it's important to know how, the country feels about him right now. more important, than talking about carbon dioxide.    but it i know but people might have voted him   no  i don't think this was one of the key issues though. it really wasn't. in the campaign. but it was one of his issues. i mean like if,    right we know that but the whole  mhm so what which president hasn't gone back on their word? ever? this is true  so which changes like should be published then are we just gonna select like oh, only, people who care about this one they might not care about this as much so let's not publish it you know? it's important to inform everybody about every_ like the decisions that he's making.   did you have a, i was just gonna say it's not a matter of being published or not it's just a matter of, which one's more important. and i think the (extra) one's more important. at this point in time. (that's what we're talking about.) i disagree. when we have no ozone layer left, y'all's stories, will be more important. this is the um, front page of the New York Times, print edition, sixty percent, yes   we knew they were stupid.  side bar? that's still above the fold. side bar told you so. this is the print edition, and then the online edition, begins with the, you know th- starts the day with the sixty percent poll and then it's overtaken by the stock market. okay what do you think about that? uh, i think the New York Times is wrong, and the Washington Post agrees with me Washington Post has a big headline, uh Bush breaks promise on carbon dioxide. yeah yeah i kinda agree with that. i agree with that too. i agree with that. with all due respect to you. well we had to fight. course, uh, your heart wasn't in it right? oh no.  oh oh i was    oh if it had been an A-B-C, Wall Street Journal poll, tchoo. did they say that in there? oh yeah. oh. we were we kinda guessed that when we were s- when we sure you did they'd probably run that one first.   that would have been   invasion of privacy?   harm. harm? harm and, truth. truth. yeah. so once again it's a, ultimately a conflict between telling the truth and minimizing harm. to people who might be harmed. uh and then specifically on this checklist it goes into detail so what are some examples of the specifics, when dealing with photographs? and also what is it about photographs that, requires a whole chapter in this book and, you know, that that we're devoting, so much time, to this one topic? there's something about photographs yeah? um the book says that, it's important to uh look at uh photographs, um, with scrutiny because they're the ones that receive the most, the most um, uh, letters and and um,  the image is what stays in your head i mean so you like might glimpse the first or second paragraph but the image is what's the most salient to the, mhm anybody see the democratic convention? yep what's the picture you remember? Clinton walking down the, Gore kissing uh Tipper. uh-oh oops. the kiss. the kiss. do you remember every word of what he said in his speech? or any words of what he said in his speech? no but but you'll remember that kiss. yeah guess so in terms of political i think that uh pictures too are oftentimes more, serious invasions of privacy than, are actual words because, it actually shows the reader, you know like the actual visual of what happened as opposed to just telling it, you know, through an uh a written account mhm why is that though? why does the photograph have more impact? it leaves less to the imagination, it's there you can't, mhm  mhm. seeing is believing. yeah. invading privacy? but what specifically what does it say? am i invading someone's privacy? alright  is this a private moment of pain and suffering that needs to be seen by our readers, or viewers? okay. uh does this story tell what i want? so actually the the Earnhardt photo, you know that might be an examp- is this is this something that, needs to be seen by our viewers or is, uh, too painful? for the family. what else, what else on the checklist? am i acting with compassion and um, sensitivity? mhm okay, okay. anything else? distance. um, which shows uh, potentially, victimizing, circumstances of the, of the, victim or, d- did you say distance? yeah distance like how far away the  yeah yeah, a close-up really close-up showing really graphic or, mhm what about_ a lotta newspapers, have a policy on no dead bodies. what if the dead bodies are tr- from a great distance? so you can't really make out any details and just see a little dot on the, horizon.  that's not even worth why?   uh huh.   well if you can't identify whose body it is it's not really so much an invasion of privacy. mhm. okay, lots of times, a picture of a body uh, you don't see the, the face,  yeah.  yeah you're right um, i think there's another checklist, after the first checklist. um, page two-twelve.   oh oh, yeah instructional value? instructional value, mhm. is it possible to present the image in such a way that it reflects, its instructional value without inflicting undue emotional distress? so present the image that could i- get involved in the play, whether it's on the front page how big it is, so forth. um, and, point four is very important disclosure what's what's that about and why is that so important? yeah? you have to be able to justify why you put the picture in in the first place, mhm so can you remember from, some of the case studies for today any examples of where, there was an explanation that was,   mhm okay good. so that was, that was published, the same time as the, mhm yeah the, well this first one, the Ohio University one, i'm not sure if it, i don't think it was on the same day, but, there was um,  it was the next, it was the next edition   next edition. they did an entire editorial page. hm. there're some more examples, from, the case studies yeah? um the, the, the kid that got shot outside the convenience store  yeah  yeah yeah, oh. well it's in there somewhere    i know that it's in there somewhere. i just saw it. anybody r-     that's where   you don't see the, photo of it. well i know i saw it somewhere. where did i see it? well you see the dear reader, one from the, mm yeah no this is it, isn't it?   oh. again the uh, Ohio University one, oh. it shows that the c- you touch base with the community let them know that, you're you're being accountable.  mhm. and what ef- what effect does that have on the reader? would you imagine? if you had to speculate_ yes? well it makes 'em be like not so outraged and th- it makes them have more respect for you and think that you're not just publishing for shock value mhm mhm, okay. and that you're taking the readers', views into consideration, showing some sensitivity, giving them an opportunity to, to react and uh, welcoming their response. mhm well the one was, the photograph that they published, was the uh picture of, the body, of one of the bodies mhm mhm  i think that showing, i mean you don't see the face of the body in this picture. and it's further away and showing, but you didn't see the face in the other picture either. right but  all the blood probably. yeah i think so. the amount of blood. yeah i i think like just the fact of like, showing, a notebook and, and something like that just like remnants it's, mhm mhm. Katie? um i think this is something about the thought that the picture of the, notebook and the blood was, would be like sensationalism. i'm,  i just have a question, that wasn't the only two pictures they had, was it? well i th- i think they had to choose between those two  so why couldn't they ha- just have shown one of the Jeep after it rolled over or, and just told the story about what happened?   yeah yeah. okay, why? if they had to, sh- show one, of the a- from the accident scene. and why would you prefer that? m- i don't know. okay. cuz it doesn't, i don't know i just, think seeing dead bodies in a newspaper i don't i mean it, it bothers you. yeah. okay. yeah? i, i mean i agree that it it's bothersome and that would be helpful but then if you you know after the explanation was made if you look at, um the letters that they received um, i was kind of, shocked to think that the reader would i mean that some of these would be, instructional value. yeah? i mean th- they didn't mention it here but also like i think sometimes it hits home more like a picture of the, students, before an im- like a a normal mhm mhm mhm mhm well at that point they didn't know who the students were  well we can jump to the other, case history where they did that.  the one with the young boy? yeah. convenience store he's m- he's yeah. th- i mean they showed both. although the parents, said that they had to show that, or they asked that they   well initially the editor, was h- highly against it saying that n- no quote unquote no way will we run this photo just because, it was, thoroughly inappropriate  mhm. now you don't see his face right? it's the  yeah. but the um,  okay and they, got input and said yeah and f- actually the family, was the one who said that yeah the the wo- it would, do some positive good then mhm well it was the reporter or the photographer which one was it? yeah i don't know whether the family was the first, no. right. please (xx) but, the_ certainly the f- uh, now, you know what i'm gonna ask you next right? what if the family had said no? mm no way. family says no, and you say okay we don't run the picture. (exactly.) just for the sake of argument somebody disagree. you don't have to personally agree with it just advocate the position. yeah? you're an independent paper and you've decided already that you wanna run the photo because it's gonna affect people and it's gonna make people understand the context of the murder more, and so i- it's it's gonna, f- y- it's gonna be serving the public good by showing this photograph and so you should show it anyway. mm. what are the concerns with him being a minor? like don't parents have to give permission for minors, to be on newspapers? i know that's well i mean th- the purpose of that is to protect someone who later in life, keep doesn't wanna have this, shadow hanging over them. unfortunately this, this young person is dead so it's, the fact th- it's a juvenile doesn't matter. right? there are no implications for the future cuz unfortunately this, person doesn't, have any further life, that's gonna be affected. the people affected are the family. right you don't have a an issue of of, withholding the name of a juvenile, for the usual reasons. you might have it for some other reason. are there any legal actions you could take if they, did it and you didn't want them to? no. First Amendment. i mean you could try, you know. i think you'd have a lotta trouble. and, the newspaper would argue what? let's suppose it did come, to it, right? family says pain and suffering you owe us ten million dollars. what would the newspaper say in court? just to, follow along on what what you were saying, just to take it one step further. i mean, i- they they would say more than just what you said they would they would say and it has great value because, you know  oh i don't know. (it) informs the public? inform the public, in order to do what?   yeah, yeah. to warn people, how serious the problem is, this crime problem. maybe it's th- you know more can be done to fight crime maybe the police need more money, right? but there're all kinds of policy implications yeah? um i'm not sure if i agree with the photo or not i'm still kinda debating but, i mean one other thing is is, i mean sad as this is, in alm- almost every paper you can read about someone being gunned down, outside a convenience store or some similar such thing  that's a very good point. and so this time, you actually have something to go with it and so i think, this one, it makes it hit home a lot more because you actually see it and you're like, oh my god as opposed to just reading about it, but i still like this is a awfully graphic photo so i'm just not really sure how i feel about it. mhm they did also decide to put it in black and white and not color  mhm of the mother the mom on the bed what what effect does that have by including that, on the front page? that affects the parents, i think a lot   mhm mhm mhm, yeah it's very moving isn't it? um, okay. what made the New York Times switch to color? i don't know. uh, i i think they, they at the time they said that, you know this is what other newspapers are doing and they can't, fall behind and, and compete with  U-S-A Today and, Washington Post i don't know. uh, i'm not so crazy about, the front page of the New York Times being in color i can see, stuff inside being in color. um, if if the New York Times decided to run a photograph of, a dead person, for some legitimate reason, then they'd have to make a re- really tough decision about color or not. they've got the picture in color are they gonna run it in color? that would be a tough decision. um, okay case study thirty-one well um, they had a policy on, no running suicides. right. and s- but since  right so they weren't sure. so it's okay. but, i just wanted to_ my personal opinion on this, okay mhm    i i agree i think um, i think they're making a case, they're making a case, to sell papers and that because they're not quite sure, you know that it was an accident   i don't understand why it's okay to show accidental deaths but not suicides like, why is that their policy or whatever anyway? that's a very good question. anybody have any idea yeah? well i oh i was just gonna say i i would have shown this but i would have run it with a story, because it is a newsworthy event   mhm they don't know the story though, c- right?    th- they they could, say all kinds of things, you know, they they could talk about what the security s- conditions were at the tower, what new precautions are being taken i mean there's all kinds of, reporting you can do. uh but let's come back to this question wh- if you had to speculate what would be the reason for not running a picture of a suicide? copy copycat. copycat, okay. anything else? glorifying yeah i was gonna say something similar to that like, they have the runaway teen policy we read we read about like, mhm  mhm what was the decision made by news organizations what to do, with that story? i'm pretty sure that's in the_ isn't that in the reading for today? it's because um people h- heard about it or (were) already hearing about it. so th- so many people were there, and, everybody was interested in it, so well we'll run it. mhm, mhm. and you know as far as this this suicide the difference between (like running) a suicide or whatever, because of copycat things they were concerned about that and they still ran it. and they were concerned about the fact that even if it wasn't, a suicide, people might try to climb up in that tower. mhm s- well that's an issue whether or not it's a suicide.  yeah mhm yeah. isn't suicide a sin in in in some religions i think in the Catholic religion, yeah if it was a terrorist situation or something like that? somebody's, somebody's being held hostage and they kill themselves?  no like if the t- if a terrorist or,       how about cults?  cults? okay. mm yeah? is there some kinda like, you know if you're a, like if Doctor Kevorkian type thing if you're, killing yourself cuz you're sick or something. mhm mhm yeah. if you're a, public official where you, serve the public in some aspect and, you're not gonna be doing that anymore. mhm. yeah   yeah. and then where it gets more difficult is where you go down,  right. negative. because? you would be supporting one side. right and you're being manipulated, by the person. on the other hand, you know, C-B-S did it, uh, Sixty Minutes. they ran th- uh, video of of a man, committing suicide with the help of, Doctor Kevorkian yeah? what about the time in uh L-A with the, the, af- the guy on the freeway? uh n- no the h- the bank robber with the guy with the assault weapons and the, guy who shot himself in the head? mhm well i i remember seeing th- those photos all through the, the L-A, news. yeah. there was one in, Detroit too. where a guy was, he was gonna shoot himself and there were a bunch of cops i think it was Detroit. yeah there were a lotta cops around, mhm mhm. yeah so in other words, they probably showed before and after right? right they didn't show that they  right right. i remember that uh i think h- uh, sho- what'd he shoot himself? but it was like four o'clock in the afternoon and uh, one of the stations the the N-B-C affiliate showed it live and, it was a big controversy about it because   oh i don't know, but i i totally remember that scene but i don't remember what happened it was l- on this like bridge and like, yeah yeah. but it it it was a very strong, reaction by the public afterwards. to the decision to, run this, live. okay, um, number thirty-two, we talked about the editor w- saying dear reader and explaining why why to run the photograph. how do you feel about r- the decision to run this photogr- some, not every newspaper ran it, right? mhm i think the people that didn't run it were right. uh huh mhm yeah. i agree also because of the fact that children will see this, and i don't know i'm sure parents wouldn't want them to see this or for them to emulate this behavior,  no the newspaper. okay. because the newspaper's gonna be on the coffee table? yeah it's on the front page i mean well it's everywhere on, newsstands. mhm. yeah yeah mhm? i agree a hundred percent that it shouldn't have been run but if it had to have been run i think they did it the best way possible. mhm.  i think you should run it i think it just shows what a moron this guy is and it's a it emphasizes, th- that you know, the type of person that he is. i think if anything, i mean everybody knows, you know what the the middle finger is what about Janeiro's argument that, we already know that he's a terrible person? mhm right that's what you were saying? mhm i y- we do but i think it emphasizes it even more. okay, yeah. i thought it was good too um i especially liked what i believe it was the executive editor did how he's like, listen you know this is what went into deciding whether or not to publish this photo, i wanna know what you think. and like gave his like, um his, fax number his phone number and like his email address and like actually told people it wasn't just like this is how we feel he's like please you know, mhm  oh i was just gonna say, it's a good th- i think it's fine that they ran it because, some people if they just read the story and think oh he got life or whatever they might start feeling sympathetic for him   or they might that he's remorseful, right right um, just i- if anyone knows the circumstances to this case i mean, when when you look at this man and look at his face and look at his contempt for the justice system, or what he did for this gi- to this girl, and i- i- it's just so necessary, to publish this photo to, capture the true essence of, what a sick human being he is if we can even call him human, i mean oh i remember this. yeah i i agree with that i mean i just feel that, it's not gonna, i can't imagine people even involved in the case being hurt by it any more than than you know what they've already been mhm  well that's, that's  what if they ran, you know a tiny little, thing where you can barely make out, i don't know, i just f- personally   so it's really a question of degree isn't it? you know that you wanna ha- you put on the front page if if you feel that, this picture needs to   mhm mhm, well yeah  yep. where he strangles   wasn't there one with the O-J case? sure. that made it to  oh i remember that now darkened his face, uh deliberately, and then later there was a big protest and they and they said well this wasn't really a photograph it was a photo illustration done by an artist. but the problem is they never said that they never said we've, changed his appearance intentionally. so that's one of the rules that i- number one don't manipulate a photograph and two if you do, don't call it a ph- news photograph. call it an artist's interpretation and clearly tell the, reader we have manipulated this p- photograph. did you have your hand up Katie? i was just gonna give another example, yeah  right right. i saw something in Sports Illustrated uh a few weeks ago speaking of NASCAR, that uh, Fox uh television uh, blocked out some of the sponsors' names,  that's right, so, two-sixty-six? page two-sixty-six of uh Doing Ethics (has the) checklist for sources yeah? oh you want me  okay uhuh  hm that's just foul yeah, yeah. hm mhm ew yeah. oh. that's what i have too. and then, how many others have,   ew oh   i think it's kinda shock value  mhm mhm   uhuh  yeah releasing it all into the air.  it shows us the severity of the problem. yep, yep okay. how 'bout a non mad cow disease story, Kathy? i've got, this is a photo of um, one of the funeral of one of the kids that died in the school shooting, th- can you hold it up again? this is the actual funeral there's a couple different ones so there musta been a like a reporter in there  uhuh mhm mhm mhm, okay. yep? i have a picture of a stripper's leg. it was um,  a stripper's leg. a stripper's leg. okay. and it was on the_ it was a front (link) page story, but the picture is like way behind, uhuh so what i think it's for     oh it's about a law it's about a law but, mhm mhm, okay. on on grounds of taste or, yeah yeah i just grabbed this from the Michigan Daily which i thought was really interesting that this is a normally a color, uh daily, mhm wonder why and i i i was really   can i say why? oh oh that's  yeah maybe there shoulda been some little explanation. i have Ellerbe  oh oh i brought this in this is Ellerbe from yesterday and, i just thought like, you know it makes him look like he's about to start crying  yeah the face is  i, i haven't heard about it it   look at look at look at this here wh- when i saw this picture i thought it, it had been      e- yeah it was. i think it's i i was reading the Detroit News yesterday and i saw that same picture it was like_ or it was a very similar picture.  but i mean look look at here   i'll  okay i think we can do a couple more yeah. um mine is a, the article is about the police raids in L-A, mhm mhm mhm so what would have been a better picture? maybe like the damage that was done to the h- you know cuz that was the main point was that these police officers just busted in and just totally destroyed these houses, um trying to sh- you know put the gangs in their place with drugs  so they got the wrong house. s- yeah something   well i have the same story but, (xx) just having a picture of just like, black like two black men (xx) i don't know if they have they have two pictures of just not include, pictures of actual people just of the damage, it'd be a less stereotyping (i thought)  (professor) yeah? sorry. like,  okay  mhm and what a close-up too it's just, mhm i have, pictures from the shooting too and they just, here they the picture they have of him i think is, him being taken away at the school and then they have, like these pictures with other students  yeah, and then they show one of the i mean this guy was i think (that somebody who was) shot in the mouth, mhm  so if you had to choose between the two, as to which picture's larger which picture's smaller wh- which do you prefer o- of these two? the the the uh, the killer, larger or the victim larger? the victims victims? everybody agree on that? but it depends    well i mean it does  i think with that one, (that's) the point of what they were saying because of the way that the killer he's like pictured i mean... maybe that's, maybe it sounds terrible but he did something really really bad and i mean he looks terrible_ no i mean, and he looks, like evil in that picture, mhm yeah i don't know if i like the one this  yeah. mhm i mean especially cuz you know a lot of states there's like questions of whether like in these, shootings by younger kids if if they should try the kid as a, as a child or an adult. mhm mhm  mhm. we don't have the time to talk about it now but remind me next time, um, when there's a choice of pictures g- choice of pictures of somebody, one, where they look, positive one where they look negative, which one do you choose and why and and, is that fair? could somebody remind me, okay 	1
OFC115SU060.json	nice to meet you Mr Letterman so how's the paper? it's good actually i um excellent i talked to, the day after i talked to you, outside of the building uhuh   interesting and uh, what did you guys talk about? wow well i asked her like about uhuh good great   great  okay um okay well it's about like malls moving into wealthy areas   mhm right  okay um, and, were you able to talk to people in the mall, or, or what? oh your great uncle George Woodworth yes my great uncle George  i talked about yeah i i kinda split it up   uhuh  great and what did you use for information, for, those, three  okay great right   right good, alright so what do you- do you have specific questions about this for me like are there parts that you think are, weak and parts you think are particularly strong? i dunno yeah i was just kinda hoping you'd read over and say this, has to be changed or okay no specific questions for me? nope nope. alright. let me take a look at this um i kinda had to throw out like, th- the first outline i gave you  that's fine yeah just like rough ideas i had... great. now, um, you m- you might though i don't know i mean and this is not so important for the paper but, i think this introduction sounds really good. um, you_ it's written really clearly and stuff. um, now i worry, whether you are capturing by interviewing your grandmother, um, that you're capturing what people do in Howell, or whether you're capturing an older, form of socializing, that still remains in Howell especially among older people. um, so you might i- it doesn't change your argument necessarily, but you might wanna qualify it in that kinda way okay okay i i made sure to ask well let me write that down um, uhuh     and she has a lot of contacts, i mean she yeah she's just, she's just like_ everyone knows her in Howell, cuz she's, you know lived there, all her life and she's big into the every kinda community thing you can imagine so did you get a, did you get and include in here the kinds of community, things that she's involved in? yeah and i pulled from the Crawford mhm  okay great. oh and the Detroit News article was awesome too    um, because they can um partly cuz they can be the new town square or whatever and people can, okay okay okay alright, um, so national brands and you're gonna talk later about security as well, right? yeah oh yeah um... and you're also i know gonna talk later about uh, um um oh like, well it's kinda like security with the youth and okay alright never mind we'll find it yeah uhuh um, um it might be good... okay here you say, your thesis is how um they change people's socializing, right? but here you're basically saying, but before we get to that we need to understand why malls develop. oh oh... just remembered, um in part this is uh the claim of Davis i gue- hm Davis and Crawford that they partly develop to fill a gap in the need to social- the gap, of places to socialize of communal places in suburbs which are just kind of tract subdivisions yeah i did um, i th- i think i, yeah i think that was in your  um, you might um mm oh okay you see what i mean?    um, okay. this is a tiny bit repetitive in here so you might just wanna somehow tighten it up, um. okay yeah you might wanna say that. mkay um  right okay  i see so it's just showing the west suburbs pretty mu- yeah  yeah huh. and it didn't show the other areas where the malls were it j- yeah it was just like on the  did it make the connection um, between_ alright the wealthier cities you sort of tell me that. does it, mention the connection between malls moving into, upper-income areas or is it not a- in that article? it yeah it didn't right mkay okay now this is a bit of a different point. right? um, i mean, this first point about um, the mall becoming a place for people to socialize, is directly tied to your, thesis right? okay      yeah yeah  yeah  mhm mhm pretty  'm'm um, so you probably wanna characterize, Howell just more clearly than that because, your previ- the whole thing you've been arguing here is why malls go where they are, and then here you're just saying, Howell's  okay   okay why not? uh... and people don't hang out there. is it designed differently? it's well it's it's right near the highway i mean which is maybe  so but she, i mean she said like you know, basically only tourists go there and i was like huh have you ever been there or no? yeah  okay  oh no it's, it's like a it's like a i see  i see i see i see i see   okay    yeah?   mhm mhm mkay so i just throw that out yeah i'd just okay okay   okay mhm oh okay um  okay yeah. um and you might wanna, tie this here to_ cuz, this is not just um variety stores becoming, um these big kind of mega, specialized stores um but this is also small um, probably locally-owned stores becoming, massive, chains, no? you mean like where people shop for all their... no i'm just uh, mm oh    well, uh it doesn't like have the, you know, expensive kinda, national chain stores and mhm okay... normal shopping not like yeah not like specialized, utilitarian kinda stuff okay. now, why is that different, um than the shopping at the mall? like to the mall you hafta get specialized you know i need, my Abercrombie shirt or whatever   oh okay  okay okay oh yeah. i mean i don't like melons but i see mhm  i yeah it builds community atmosphere i mean right right. right you- tell me yeah tell me what it does. okay um yeah i thought so too.  yeah like in other words like if if, it was you know, oops i just hit that thing okay   so... um now did your grandmother explicitly say that strangers join the, um... golf league and stuff like that and can become part of the community? or did she not say that? did she explicitly say it? uh cuz if  where did she talk about the (community...?) she said, the whole- the neighborhoods are still closely knit but not the whole c- the city as a whole, uhuh okay, okay. alright neighborhoods. are you gonna talk about that neighborhood's closely knit? i think i do i think i mention it later okay i'll put it down here to put it somewhere. um so i'd just drop that actually. okay okay yeah... okay. yeah both okay yeah you might wanna... pull that out a little bit. um... now do you think_ again, do you think, cuz i think this is an older person thing. do you think this is an older person thing, or do you think kids do this too? about, like church and volunteering at the hospital?      mhm yeah it is  okay mhm um, cuz... um, i mean and these are two separate things right? i mean you can't answer the question about why there's no mall been built. maybe it's a question of time. um, maybe there's a mall close enough. um, is there a mall close enough or is there a mall pretty far away...? uh there's, i think there's kinda one in Brighton mhm. how far away is that? maybe fifteen, minute   mhm mhm mhm okay okay    okay okay good okay... so kind of a thesis of the  but each age group has their own way of hanging out as well. okay okay...? that's interesting yeah it was kinda funny when i went to ask the, the    why do you think i was like see i... i was trying to figure it out and and and i, i couldn't really come up with anything cuz it's not a l- it's not c- there's no way it's a liability thing you know i mean no it can't be a liability thing. i mean it must be in a way... since a mall is dependent so much on like, image right? i mean malls, are not about utilitarian shopping they're  uhuh okay  what'd she say? uh hold on a minute, where is it? oh, okay. i was trying to like write everything down while she was talking yeah i know it's very hard to take notes isn't it...? um... well i mean i i like that framing of it whether she said it in those terms or not, i mean ma- the mall as a family event right? mhm bless you bless you yeah i'll just throw like  oh okay mhm yeah okay i just need a tissue. that guy's talking pretty loud he's the largest- he has the loudest voice in the history of the world.  all the time oh okay he talks to himself and other people and, um, he's not really crazy just a little bit crazy. okay. uh, ta ta ta ta ta oh  okay cool this is kinda what i was, talking about with the window shopping. that's why, i kinda right um... yeah i mean y- this may not belong here and it may not, belong in this form.  uhuh.  right. so  where where is your mailbox by the way? i should probably ask ab- cuz it's due like in your mailbox on Tuesday oh yeah um it is um you know where the door to our our office is? i mean to our classroom is? yeah it is s- down three floors, and that same door.  right. but the first door on your left as you, walk in from that side. or the last door on your right, depending which side you're coming from. okay? um, and uh it's, the mail folders are on the left-hand side after you walk in the door, um and alphabetized but um, s- it's a little confusing like there are two sets of alph- i don't know why right  right. but the appearance of safety isn't just like, an unimportant thing right? the appearance of safety turns out to be really important. so, um, well i guess this doesn't under- um, okay maybe l- that doesn't undermine it. that's okay i guess maybe just add the  sure okay isn't this kinda like why, all the pro- it's from the mall because like they're all made from the same kinda like structure across the country and? yeah, but now i_ Crawford might have a point that you could, help make your argument more but it's not this one, i mean doesn't she talk somewhere about um, uh how if you're a private independent company you actually have to, pay more for mall space? i think she does. mkay hm... mkay mhm oh, yeah right   mhm mhm oh yeah. it's   yeah. okay here you go. now, this is, these are important observations about what stores are in this mall, um, but you just make the observations and don't kind of milk them for, the kinds of connections you can make to the stuff we've talked about in class right? so, um, here's a good example this is clearly, a like, middle middle-class not an upper, upper middle-class mall, right? um, and mhm   um, it depends if you have other things to say about why adults go to malls mhm later. later.  i think later i- i mean you talked about adults going to, eat dinner and  yeah and then they also go to window shop and stuff i dunno  okay cuz you need to have a car to go anywhere right i didn't hang out in a mall when i was a kid and my parents would never drive me around right? but like f- it is, you're right this is a very important point like, youth can't drive, they can't drive period. well she, did i okay here we go. no or  okay now see   i think yeah okay, alright... okay. now i dunno i guess not i just always thought aesthetically was like visual.   just everything? well... Janet? mhm okay  now. what did you observe, about the way, Twelve Oaks, is designed? that is, um, i mean does it have, oh you said it's gonna have a glass elevator. but it doesn't now.  okay okay, so it has two glass elev- it's, no. two glass elevators, um fountains, marble, what? fountain, there's a fountain fountain. what else what else does it look like? describe it to me well they're just like tearing up the whole f- first floor right now  so w- it, it wasn't like one of the nicest malls i've been to  uhuh okay. he- here's, these two things do belong together. but they i think belong earlier, right? because here's, the, the problem is that um, Novi was an early mall right? i th- yeah fairly early you said it was made in the seventies  s- s- it's just to, make sure that people go there instead of other places okay to make sure people go there now why do they have to renovate it? because of so that people will go there instead of other nicer malls okay, right so i mean, it's about, this in some sense it's about kind of creating a beautiful, um fantasy space. right? that's, um, up with the times, right? that's not somehow like seventies style right?  oh no, (let go.) oh it uh where does it go? it's a sort of, it's a sort of key chain like thing. it it's uh oh i see this fits between... do you  sure i don't want you... yeah oh there how weird...  uhuh   okay. mhm that make sense? yeah... now why do you think, that there's nobody in the middle? why do you think it's forty-five to sixty and w-   yeah, um... i don't exactly know what it's about either. um, mall jobs don't pay good wages. mhm  okay, so so there's a good opportunity for you to, look outward a little bit and, ask how this connects to some of those bigger things we've been talking about. so look for other opportunities to do that and you can- you don't need to write whole paragraphs about that right you just need a couple of sentences that, will help, actually structure, help, highlight and structure your argument. um, and then it'll be totally great. okay i- it- ended a little quickly  right  right  well i guess i don't well i dunno i mean you know maybe partly maybe not entirely um, uh, yeah i mean these are really good questions. i don't expect you to be able to answer them. right? i mean, these are big questions. um, but you okay okay yeah, yeah. um, and partly i think when i say that, um, i also just want you to be making those connections as you go through about malls you know, stimulating consumer desire right? um, about uh, what else...? um, you know you might want to in the section that you're talking, um, well maybe not. um mhm hm? i'm tired but no this is this is totally great and um, you know since you've done this much work already and you've got five days left to finish it, you're gonna be totally fine yeah alright.  yeah okay. other questions for me? um, uh d- do y- did i do a reasonable job like... like on this you wrote, you know right here you said broader economic shifts and here you       mhm   totally good. um, and uh, tomorrow will be pretty mellow. um, we'll watch this movie, we'll eat doughnuts oh really?  cool yeah and then just have that outline about which,   yeah alright, have a good weekend  and i'll see you tomorrow yep, sounds good. make sure you take this off before you uh head out of here. or you aren't gonna get so far. now i really hope that Danika isn't here yet what time is it anyway? how do you get this off? you just like push on this part uh i have kinda incompetent hands at the moment oh, where is can you do it? yeah. it's caught? yeah it's caught somehow. oh here it's got this little, there we go. here what time is it? what time is it? holy shit it's four o'clock oh my g-  am i supposed to fill this thing out too? uh yes okay oh where, it's the, at that, the same booth that had all the, (xx) right right right. but, what is it? oh it's the little Japanese, toy, things oh right right right right right right right right i bought a beautiful, dress there oh yeah? it's really gorgeous. that's just, notes okay. alright here you've got some good stuff  right  mhm    right right mhm      mhm, right  the parents' organization really just seemed to be more of a, report  mhm  mhm um there wa- NARAL had a, petition mhm  s- abortion rights okay  right so nothing, no kind of specifically no    now what were they? uhuh i  oh okay okay i missed both of those that's okay that's okay, um was passing out um, uh, flyers about their, housing testing  uhuh okay they didn't  um,  right right. okay so and right it may be partly to sort of expand their audience and to mhm   mhm  mkay i don't  uh right  that's okay, um, so talk to me about what you think the analysis is.  sure. i don't know i- the food wasn't_ there wasn't really anything surprising mhm anthropology doesn't have to be about surprises right the... i think there was definitely a recognition that in order to have something like this, um, even though there may be largely political motivations, in order to get people to come out and have a good  absolutely, yeah and, that they... were in s- in in some part just appealing to what you know kids would wanna eat like th- with the snow cones and  uhuh  right. yeah i think definitely. um, it was also all, uh, small businesses right right like y- right   ah  um, so um, i mean this also may be an attempt to- and some of them were like small caterers   get the word out yeah get     mhm mhm  right because usually at these outdoor festivals, you see like, there's a Greek stand and right mhm mhm right. so th- you know they presumably made that decision cuz mhm  mhm  mhm um, there was definitely a lot of... a lot of like racial pride,  okay right okay so racial pride, some of which is expressed through, um, leaders. so like  mhm right you know they had Michael Jordan posters, right right okay so. you want probably to take, i mean that is one category and you wanna think about what     mhm  mhm    right mhm  mhm mkay with the merchandise? um, looks like you got your leaders paragraph  (well) not only cheap jewelry  they had some nice things. but, i mean there was a wide range right  right (so listen,) do you wanna do laundry later? do you want to do laundry, around four or  i'll call you. okay,   um, where're you gonna be are you gonna be? are you gonna be on campus? well i've got my bike so i'll go home and then i can, pick you up. but i'll be on okay i'll call you. cuz i may be here okay okay so, i dunno i don- i don't have any clear synthesizing okay okay so alright um, keep let's before we move to the jewelry and the... forget about the jewelry. the jewelry is, okay right mhm mhm right um ah... well... i mean in terms of the clothing and the hats and the scarves   okay so, we've got a kind of, connections to Africa theme. okay. oh that was easier than i thought. you see?      right and African, linking to Africa, with Cleopatra and Nefertiti, all the way to Nelson Mandela. right... my spell checker by the way did not s- find Cleopatra it wanted to put in something completely wrong um, international connections, in the p- in in the past and the present past and present right. i mean an- and i i i might treat them differently because i mean one is, one is about um, paralleling, black oppression internationally. right mhm  so right. so we've got two points the sort of, international, um... politics or   mhm... mhm  mm no alright. um, then you need to think about why it's there i mean mhm i-  cuz leaning post sounds to me like something old yeah.     right  right in a way yeah so um, figure out if you can what its history is you may be able to  okay mhm   mhm mhm mhm     mhm  right  everyone knows what it means.   right mhm right   mhm mhm  okay. and you wanna think i mean, as_ again back to the sort of big framing question, uhuh mhm  mhm right mhm well the, respect the black man and then the protect ba- black families right   right  okay great so you've got, another theme   down mhm    well it's, it's appropriating white images and making them black. mhm. so right in your words uh, why? okay right. so i mean especially in a way the, i mean this is this is high culture right right   so? um, ap- takin- appropriating Christianity as a black, religion. right... yeah. i mean, i mean obviously the the prevalence of, religious imagery i mean the church is really, important. right right. right mhm   right i think it's... kind of an empowerment thing.   uhuh okay okay right. yeah. i think that's a very good point. um, i mean it's also making a kind of yeah  mhm   right right uh  in terms of  i think we covered, let me find the page that's got the, actual notes i mean, i think that  okay, good. um, so what you need to do now is kind of, pull, and this might be a good section for you to work on first since you've    right mhm   in with everything else now i i'm not saying you can't i  mhm  mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm there to- yeah okay    don't know don't know. we just don't know. alright mhm  okay  yes  um... well this is, an article that was published in the Ann Arbor News, with an, interview with her and it says right right okay um... a good th- a good thing for you to think about in framing the whole thing and maybe this is something you wanna do first and then go into the details  mhm nineteen eighty-three and nineteen eighty or nineteen  yeah me either but, so n- you know that a shift happened sometime a shift happened sometime, um... i think, definitely what you said about right right um i have a suspicion that they kind of just gave up on the for  mhm right. it does turn out to be sort of interesting that they gave up on the housing thing, um, given that the other reason_ what's the oth- okay so we- we'll keep going. alright so, um, you mentioned that this is not, this is not a positive reason for the shift  think big. what's happening to children over the last, ten years? they've become increasingly, vilified okay... alright vilified children uhuh and  and schools are, increasingly underfunded, mhm okay, and there's, they're, seems like they're, fairly focused on the education. right right one of the, one of the articles described them specifically as um, a group that works with the school system. okay okay great. so, schools underfunded they are in a way um, is there more single parent families? there is. um, there,  sort of, yeah th- th- the eg- actually specifically says that they target, single parent okay okay    mhm right kind of kind of as a buffer or yeah yeah, um that have been affected by these sort of big economic transformations mhm, and also the current teenage population is huge. right. so  yeah yeah the current even preteen  right mhm  i think that they, are ex- they are explicitly saying that they want to show children, that there is an African-American community. that    uh  oh okay um, so you need to be thinking about, um, this festival and this organization, um representing this community, in a moment of displacement. now you've    right when you can't live any- when right when   um, so i mean that's in in part, African-Americ- their mhm right mhm mhm  right  mhm mhm uhuh  hm  i don't remember. i'll have to look through 'em again yeah so i mean look through it again and see if there are, um, ways that the community is described,   mhm   mhm  okay the- okay mhm  i guess it's just that there's, there's a sense of well it used to, you know it used to be that we all lived together and every- and everything was fine but now we don't even know each other. okay. okay. and so, interesting, uhuh  well maybe not only that right? um, i mean part of it is that, that area, got gentrified and people   right    who don't, right  right  right    mhm mhm  mhm  right mhm mkay mhm mhm,  yeah it's pretty,  um, does this help you start to think about sort of, an argument and a frame? yeah. yeah. to start to. it's gonna be hard i mean i think i think that most i mean, i think that if you pull together this stuff you have an argument and a frame i mean   right. uhuh this, was the beginning right yeah okay so here's, um, right. so that is the beginning of your, mhm uhuh   uhuh   okay? does that help? yeah yeah i've got um, and you didn't think you were going to so, yeah yeah mhm  right right. cool okay? lemme,  lemme give you my homework, before  and i thought you might find this amusing so i printed it out. from The Onion The Onion? yeah it's a,  oh   but yeah it in es- especially in light of, last night's uh look at that  i didn't   on the su- same juvenile crime bill oh my god    well i mean you know that i personally am hoping for the death of this juvenile justice bill because i think it's an absolute disaster area it's but yeah i guess it went on, uh, wel- into the early morning everyone just putting amendments on this thing. every knee-jerk reaction they could possibly think of i mean you know i don't think that there's any particularly, simple, coherent answer we can craft to the problem of juvenile crime but like that ain't it anyway.   you're   well thank  oh you should feel absolutely free to i'll be on that email forever  and i didn't get a chance to print out a course guide but i think it_ if like when i've narrowed it down to a few i'll probably email you and a- email me yeah    oh yeah good point. um, okay so uh Roberto Aguillar, um... um i've heard good thing- see a lot of my professors are gone now. um i've heard good things about um, what the hell's her name? alright sh- Christine, Green, who studies Eastern Europe, mhm  (alright, and so,) that'll help me. um  okay yeah cuz i have to, see an academic advisor. but, i wanted to wait till grades are in cuz hopefully that'll make me look better you should um, you know who you should s- do you have an academic advisor who  Linda Donohue okay  alright  no problem and uh, you'll get my paper, and hopefully it'll be good. i'm  (there you go.) (xx) (put) the little_ like over there somewhere and i (trust i- your judgment) i put it in the okay oh look. i don't get a break. oh, sign your initials. i have to sign my initials? oh, goodness i didn't do that i think a check'll do it   there's no videotape hm? there's no videotape yeah. well, anyway if there were i would still allow it yeah just this yeah this part? yeah. so they can sort us into categories mm. alright?  okay  mhm uhuh right  uhuh good oh     uhuh right uhuh  okay.  in the way that... i think first, um... if, if you help all the homeless  mhm mhm mhm   um right yeah um  uh but i think you're right that they're um, and and the the point you made about the Focus Hope in Detroit um, is interesting that in a way the um, what they're doing for the residents is, um, in bringing them into sort of the economic mainstream and in fact back to the factory working um that used to be the center of Detroit, um, is also an attempt to bring Detroit back to that, same kind of, mhm   great okay good sorry to cut you off there 'm'm. no i think that's fantastic um, so they're they're aware of that kind of limitation of the, mhm  well, mhm mhm yeah um, i haven't interviewed Ariel yet okay that's your sister? yeah. um, so i don't really know that much about that right now um yeah you do well i do from, kinda okay well you're right you don't you don't know, what she's gonna say and you  i know that, it is, i mean, first of all it's a huge problem in in in New York. there's tons of money spent trying_ you know for, everything from soup kitchens  right   what other ways do they give the city a bad name? i think that's a really important point what, what  um, it uh, home- homelessness adds to the to crime a lot um, adds to, desperation and more mental ill- ill- right right well right. yeah i mean, homelessness definitely, um, exacerbates all those kinds of problems i think that's right. um, but homelessness also i mean is a great example of just, what adds to the kind of fear of cities or sort of the sense that cities are just out of control.  yeah  oh really  let me ask you this. mhm why is homelessness such a big problem in New York? sorry to interrupt you why is it, yeah  right cuz there're not many people there's just overpopulation in in New York part of it, i d- i think mkay. mm that's half the que- half the question, um, there's not_ overpopulation, is kind of a strange question i mean New York is alrea- is overpop- i mean New York is like built up, ten twenty stories whatever hm   too much i mean  no way   yeah mhm  mhm they have like a home and right um uhuh    one one thing that they said uhuh mhm right huh  yeah  okay okay it'll come back yeah basically that write it down yeah that's probably a good idea  uhuh okay, right. or, okay lemme help you reformulate that into a kind of academic thesis. um, something like um, cuz, cuz you wanna think like we've done in this class sort of repeatedly about, these organizations as both, um their resp- they look the way they do in part because of the kinds of problems they're trying to respond to right? um, uh, but, they don't themselves sort of, create those problems   mhm mhm yeah  well i, i had some ideas i mean one was to kind of focus more on, the actual mission statements, and just, do a lot about that um, but then i thought that shouldn't be the f- the focus point but it should be just kind of in, you know  right i think i agree with you there because, it's  right, um, i uh, i dunno i mean, like, it just seems that Ne- that New York and Detroit are, like they're both major, cities and Detroit during its heyday, is more comparable to New York now than, uhuh  uhuh you know who you need to think about, to think about New York and Detroit? and i can't remember if i told you this before is Saskia Sassens. Detroit is a global city. mhm right oh sorry  mhm mhm. okay now i've got, one caveat. um, i think this is a start for a thesis, right?  mhm   right   mhm yeah yeah, i mean it's it's, it's a very different strategy i think probably because, i mean they're they're two very different things in the sense that, Dudley Street, was, people that lived in like a small area right right. but they are_ i mean you're right they're focused more on a sort of economic issue less on a sort of neighborhood housing issue at least   hm mhm yeah yeah right mhm       yeah. and and he was kinda, promoting it,   they gotta do that or they don't get any money yeah  right. well different people in diff- in the same organization are gonna have really different analyses of the  mhm okay while it's all  mhm okay yep alright okay thank you. i f- i i feel much better now. good s-    and also i just, wanna say something um, i just wanna say that it's, very rare that i feel comfortable in a class, enough to like talk and it, usually doesn't happen and it took me a little while but i just wanna say that this is, a class that, i definitely felt,   i mean i, i came here and i spent, two years taking every wrong class that wasn't for for me cuz my grandparents are like be a doctor  right good. and i spent my whole college career taking classes that now i think i shouldn't have taken so  happens to the best of us  alright. thank you very much send Rupa in  good luck writing and i'll uh, yep alright definitely hi (are you uh,) if i don't see you oh yeah have a great time  bye. (xx)  excuse me come on in... um, grab a microphone. (oh it's like_ i'll grab it,) if i could ask you to fill this out um   mkay this, it's pretty much a lot   i just got a bunch of, um articles and some of 'em,  that's very interes- surprising yeah  thank you oh i see somewhere is that alright? mhm that'll be great mkay alright so. talk to me what are your  okay good  right. okay. um, alright... i wanna tell you to start number one by not starting with this. okay okay mkay mhm   okay  uhuh okay  right not this other one in five yeah     that's how they interpret it as yeah more so, uhuh um, did for instance your father and mother assertively sort of make that kind of  uhuh, right so  um that's, i mean he was the only one who said  uhuh, okay. um, i'm just uh... i'm wondering if um, if this is an ig- i mean i- you know it's an insufficient material to work with in some sense but if this, if you're gonna use this, kind of argument of your father's as a way of um, arguing that, he is making a kind of claim not to whiteness particularly but, um, disclaiming, racial discrimination as, mhm  yeah it's a different yeah. it's a   um and then also, the way that, um, they view, African-Americans in, okay what kinds of stuff have you got about that? um, well with my parents and my cousin, just um, equating, um like dangerous areas with being pre- predominantly okay did you get any  um they kind of just like walked around that question. huh  uhuh   right  mhm right right right. um     and then just with bad experiences mm the one thing my cousin said that, um there was one patient who, um, just didn't like, Indian occupational therapists just because i_ well, she said that it wasn't because she had a bad experience but mostly cuz she was, like had a psychological problem i think she was schizophrenic but, that she was convinced that, she was this other therapist who, talked down to her or something like that huh   yeah. yeah  um  yeah   uhuh  uhuh  right   to, India right yeah  mhm  yeah,  that's true big waves of immigration that led to, these not quite white ethnics that Sugrue was talking about. because you can just, you know it's a lot  you can call you can be in sort of constant email contact, mhm yeah yep   right so you know you can be in kind of constant contact with the  or even like private, um smaller businesses like with the, commu- cu- computer industry opening up that, a lot of Indian people have started their own businesses and then, go to India like every few ye- years not just for travel but for work too right. right so like, you wanna think about all those ways um, that um, those kinds of ties and see if you can like       mhm right so you know, and things like that that  that's true um right or clothing_       um... see i don't know like what, i should put in the paper and what i just shouldn't cuz it just seems  mhm right  right    right  well i mean there may be uh, an example of, um, the kind of changing class of Indian immigrants right   and that's what i thought i'd talk about cuz   in what kinds of ways do you think? um, i think just how intermarriage between castes is so, stigmatized uhuh  huh  so i thought  yeah because even talking like um, with some family friends um, just what_ well my parents, they just seem so different, uhuh yeah that makes sense i mean yeah personal history  right  right um, uh i mean India has, a tradition of sort of leftist politics i mean is your family involved in that,   so, yeah  okay yeah so it's just different, different um, but i mean you've got an interesting question about sort of the way, um, racial_ cuz i mean, the caste structure, we can talk about it as a, racial structure in some sense i mean, uh or even just like with, i mean i don't know about other Asian countries but, India just even state-wise it's so different so different language different culture, and even intermarriage between that is kind of  right across religious lines  so it's like all that stuff, right   um kinda influenced how right. influence interpretations here. okay. mkay  i mean i think with the whole multiculturalism, you know it's, that they don't really necessarily, feel that, they need to_ i mean it stressed on um, with second-generation Indians and, retaining the Indian culture and, so it's not like, it's all, it's stigmatized if you lose that so, it's different than the not quite white  why? okay well right um uh i don't know well it's a hard question it's a  um, or even like intermarriage i mean it's more common between um, an Indian person, and a white, person rather, than the other way or, i mean like, if an Indian, person was to marry a black, right right  mhm mhm yeah the, are becoming it works right okay mhm  um i had an uncle who actually always used to say that but i think that's say what?    huh huh yeah well i mean, i, w- we can't, without talking to more people we can't  yeah yeah that'd probably uh, and you know given the things that you said about sort of, um, what like Britain_ i mean sort of, moving to Britain would mean yeah       yeah but i think that, i mean after iviner- interviewing some people at my mom's clinic i think they're the exception, mhm  right. what do you think that uh, what do you think about sort of those close, working relationships, do to your parents' understandings of sort of race and the way they position themselves as Indian-Americans etcetera? um even with when i was talking to my cousin, somehow they put themselves like in between, mhm  middle, yeah i think that's important. i mean somewhere in the middle and i would maybe add like, i mean outside of like, in some sense then outside of the racial structure. i mean, whether or not that's, actually true, um but in some sense like,  mm mm mhm right i think this goes with your multiculturalism argument right   a somewhat estab- yeah there's a sort of Indian community. and um, even if they, their neighbors are white, see and i think it's important to sort of think about, suburbs as spaces that neighborhoods don't actually make community at all mhm yeah yeah  the whole_ yeah for, like going along with that and then yeah like in a way i mean you could start with, laying out, i mean in some sense you've got to lay out what the not quite white argument is  okay. does Sugrue write any more about it besides, the one section in, is that from a book? about it is  um it's uh... um... it's called um, The Origins of the Urban Crisis. mhm okay       oh okay   that's true um, uh, and, then you have your kind of um, bigger sort of also reasons that it might not, entirely work. you know? where the, er-  so how class also has a role? right i mean if if, um Indian-Americans are coming over as educated professionals, or getting their education here, then they're kind of in the... you know upper middle-class, mkay       i think it seems just  yeah yeah not very many um, 'm'm a lot. okay. um, yeah  mhm  okay. whoa.   yeah it's very hard starting. so go home  yeah  yeah  it can make you ill yeah. and i'm starting to, pack cuz i'm leaving in a week from, for Japan so, that seems like even more attractive than starting this  yeah. i'm excited now. i think the day after i get there though i have to take a test, to, like placement exams wait so you do speak some,  how much? um, i've taken three years oh that's a lot    it'll be nice to actually be there and then like, just be surrounded by it and,  i used to speak Japanese you did? when i was a kid really? wow so you probably picked up so much i did it was great i mean, i think it probably actually, helped i mean i don't know anything about any Japanese now i know cuz you pick up so much  cuz i- even sometimes i, um i wish when i was little like they'd write like Japanese characters  i don't know how much i retained (of them) so no right well, you don't necessarily but, well have a really good time. sounds like  good, i'm glad that's great. it's good class good alright well i enjoyed you in it as well and uh, do keep in touch if you you know, need anything from me okay have a safe trip i will, and have a safe trip to Japan that's a (xx) oh thanks i'll tell my_ i have a good friend who's um, fluent in Japanese in San Francisco and he'd be very jealous... alright bye bye 	1

LEL175SU098.json	okay a few announcements... a few announcements. before we begin i get a lot of email questions and you can keep telling me lots of questions about, project number three. just to remind you, for project number three which is due on Wednesday... is it okay to have one area of sequence homology or do you not want that at all? oh that's fine. absolutely you mean highlight it? amino acid homo- homology. yes but did you me- are you saying that you have one sequence highlighted on your, protein? that is an amino acid, sequence homo- homo- ho- yeah. even though it's structurally it's um amino acid also? it's not necessarily. it would depend did you do multiple line? yeah. okay. so, it depends if you have done multiline, you wou- might be dramatically disc- uh suh- actually dismayed, to find that a lot of your proteins are not, sequentially, homologous. but the G-G, X G yes that's fine. and if you wanna highlight that that's great. you are not required i don't believe i dropped multiline out of the requirement, because it would take a lot more time, to do a sequence, analysis of your proteins. but if you want to, don't be amazed, if your proteins are really not, homologous in terms of their sequence. it's the space, that, that's the_ that's what the DALI server is doing is showing how they look in space. any questions whatsoever? i haven't even been on email yet today just in case you're, wondering why i haven't replied. i have this, haunting suspicion that there's lots of email so i hope, i'm getting a lot of your a- of your questions answered here, which should do that. yes Andy? by looking at the two overlapping structures, how are you supposed to determine where it is structurally homologous. by looking at the two overlapping where you're supposed    did i want the   glucose glucose, that's one thing. hexokinase to use it? to use it, it's already using it, there would be no point to reverse that. so it's always (gonna do) this as much as it can. but it doesn't do the muscle any, benefit, to be able to reverse all of, glycolysis. yes? would the muscle create glucose if the blood gl- glucose dropped, precipitously and there was like danger to the whole organism or something? no, be- w- it might, it might reverse this to some extent, but it would never be able to send it out to other cells. oh that's right cuz it doesn't have the is vasopressin a, hormone? it is, yes... yes, the cholesterol for  i have a question about this whole creatine business yeah  the creatine phosphate i think you can get either one. which, i mean it astounds me. if it's creatine phosphate that you're eating, what are the chances that it's gonna be uptaken? that the phosphate (sycon) i mean that's the whole key, to glucose transport. you can't get the glucose phosphoryl- phosphorylate (into cells) so (it's) just is it broken down in the stomach because if it's all the acids  protein why does it work then? ah how about if you couple it with glucose? does  with glucose? whatta you mean? in one ingested form? no, if it bonds to glucose then, wouldn't the cell pick up the glucose, (and) then pick up the creatine? not, not likely. oh (xx) can i (ask a) (xx?) mhm  you could but, nothing's ever gonna be shown  um, do all the phosphates that are attached to to the uh, tyrosines end up going to other proteins? yes, all of 'em? um, is the glucagon that binds to the protein, is that what stimulates the G-T-P to, attach to the yes okay two yes 	1
LES420MG134.json	should like those of you who (came punctually) to get your full money's worth. uh your papers will be coming back, in a painfully slow trickle, cut the profanity this time.   Kreutzer never played it. it was written for whom? Bridgetower George Bridgetower. and what's wrong with the other half of that title? it's not a sonata it's not a sonata. what is it? concerto quasi concerto yeah quasi, (begins) with a violin, as a pr- places more importance on the violin than the piano okay that's, definitely a, the structure's rather elusive and fleeting and, whatever,   there's nothing obvious about it okay. specifics. the key areas, um is A the tonic or is it really just, the dominant of D? D minor, right. okay? the key area isn't. a key area. it starts on... it starts somewhere, and goes somewhere, but neither the, point of departure nor the destination of the first phrase happen to be the tonic. okay? and, the piano plays the same game, right? where, wh- where can we start to talk of a key area or any kind of, tonal definition? the beginning of the transition? exactly. the beginning of the transition. which we usually think of as taking us away, from something, and deluding our ear into thinking that something else, is the tonic. is the aural home base. Beethoven has been doing this lately right? the first movement of the so-called Tempest Sonata. the D minor opus thirty-one number two. doesn't, present you with a key area. we're not sure what it is that sp- he's presenting us with. maybe an accompanying recitative, but tonal definition comes only with, half step what kind of half step? rising rising half step. okay. alright. let's, listen and i'm gonna stop when we get to the transition. you can sleep unimpeded Mr Dzerzhinski (cuz i'm gonna) turn the lights off here. i've got a uh we we were listening to (Schigedi) and uh, and uh Bartok last time, this is Georg Kulenkampff and Georg Szolti, the two, Georgs. Szolti playing the piano. (rising) (a rising?) rising half steps. and nothing but. okay? uh so that gives us three distinct key areas. in this exposition. well kind of. alright? A minor, which was established as tonic only by the transition. E major, for that, transition the transition the most stable part of the exposition. becomes appropriately, the material for the closing passage the cadential passage. now rather than work uh phrase by phrase through the development section let me simply say, that it starts, with an A minor triad, that is the original tonic which we never heard in the first key area, and immediately continues on F... now that lurch, suggests the tonal trajectory. okay we're gonna fling from the original tonic far to the flat side. A-flat. D-flat. even, E-flat minor and guess what it's unfailingly the rising half step that takes us there. remember that passage in the first symphony when we were when i was ruining the humor of Beethoven for you? i said okay he's gotta get the tonic to go down by a half step so what's he gonna do? make the bass rise by half steps until he gets there. okay same kind of thing going on here only i don't think it's very funny. i don't think it would be much exaggeration at all to say that that one interval the rising half step is the basis of the development section. in this movement and the consequences, are drawn with brutal consistency in the recapitulation. what, do we expect in harmonic terms the recapitulation to reassert? tonic the tonic right? but what Beethoven, is going to reassert, is not the tonic, but, the sense of bewilderment, that we felt at the beginning of the exposition. what is, the tonic, anyway? okay? here's, our retransition, starting there, okay? uh preparing... uh A minor, not A major, and then you've down here it gives us, A major, clear as day right? which he immediately reinterprets as the dominant of four. of the minor. subdominant. well okay. we've had plenty of D minor, in the slow introduction, why not here too? but then you have uh, mo- most cases it's you know the the hero rescuing the damsel in distress kind of thing it doesn't have to be but some kind of, rescue is performed, is necessary by the plot anyway, as part of the resolution of the opera okay is it usually a damsel in distress? no uh i shouldn'ta put it that way that's loaded ah yeah i shouldn't put it th- i'm sorry i wa- feeding you there. Mr Froid, what's a rescue opera? it would be a a usually a, like the Entfuehrung of Mozart would that be one? where it's a woman of nobility is taken by, the exotic other, and then they have if that's a rescue opera it's it's a rescue opera only as a spoof. a rescue opera is a sub-genre of opera comique, uh the first prominent example of which, is um Gretry's, Richard Coeur de Lion Richard the Lion Hearted, uh seventeen eighty-five. but what's usually happening is that some victim, of raw political oppression, is unjustly imprisoned. kept in the pokey, and only the self-sacrificing, intervention, of a loyal friend or spouse, suffices to save the day, a hair-breadth escape at the eleventh hour, is the usual pattern. and hair-breadth's escapes at the eleventh hour from the forces of tyranny had an obvious topical relevance, in revolutionary Paris. now i don't know whether Schikaneder's motives, in producing Cherubini, in imperial Vienna, were political, i mean is this the old uh, uh free-masonic idealist, coming back to haunt, the businessman here? or is he simply banking on the appeal of a cliff-hanging story? for any audience aristocratic or revolutionary? i don't know. either way he was so successful with his discovery, of Cherubini, that uh, the court theater, sent B- Baron von Braun, to Paris, to negotiate directly with Cherubini and get more scores. to produce, in Vienna. and the rivalry was on between, Schikaneder's Theater an der Wien, and, the Hoftheater, that was superintended by Baron von Braun. uh, both houses produced versions of Cherubini's Les Deux Journees, in August eighteen two Schikaneder one day before, the court theater as you can see uh in August of all times. what's wrong with this picture? in August Vienna is so hot, and miserable that nobody wants to be there. they all go off in the_ why is Beethoven in Heiligenstadt? and that sort of thing wh- because nobody wants to be in the capital and yet, s- i_ this is the only way i can explain it to myself so intense was the rivalry between these two theatrical ex- establishments to be first with Cherubini that they couldn't wait for the opening of the normal theatrical season. the court theater, produced Midi in November... and Schikaneder produced Elise in December in what, Thayer called a sadly mutilated version, as Der Bernardsberg of course this all had to be translated into German. uh and French operas by Cherubini and Mehul and Lesueur, among others became all the rage in Vienna for the next several years. now Beethoven as i tried take pains to point out to you in the very, in the second lecture of the semester Beethoven had been raised on opera comique. in Bonn. but he'd rather lost connection, with that repertoire since seventeen ninety-three. well Beethoven apparently responded quite enthusiastically to this new repertoire both to the musical style and to the subject matter and for the rest of his life he would regard Luigi Cherubini as his favorite dramatic composer. how many of you had to learn Cherubini music in any of your music history classes? my god. good. what did you have to learn? oh, i i did my undergrad work here so they they bring it all into the_ it's all in Grout Palisca ah they finally they've seen the light.  yes   right Leonore? Fidelio Fidelio  Florestan Florestan. they're written from the point of view of Florestan Mr Froid? i'm sorry is she the one that descends down into the uh, into the prison to save_ i'm not familiar with their names, no i'm laughing at Mr Werner's response the s- the sign you see_ i mean it wouldn't have done justice to Al Gore in one of the debates right? he does that to me all the time he does it to me all the time...  mhm    i think you're on to the you're you're you're you're you're hearing it in the right way but just, uh with a literalism that's is causing you to confuse, uh, Leonore with Florestan. or with the audience's perspective which at the very beginning of this overture is taken down, into the, figurative, pit, for him to sing, or his, instrumental proxies in the orchestra to sing, In des Lebens Fruehlingstagen. okay? as we shall see. uh, Beethoven, scored, these overtures, two and three, for the biggest orchestra he required before the fifth symphony and sixth symphony. we got uh, two each, of flutes oboes clarinets bassoons, for the first time a second pair of horns, horns in C and E major for reasons (which) obvious, uh later on, and three different flavors of trombone. okay? trombones being regarded as particularly appropriate for, for the dungeons right    but they're not pairs of alto trombones? i don't think so no. that would be that would be oh that's t- oh okay didn't i ask last time ho- how many spoke Italian? did i is this is, okay? alright... he prefaces the overture, with the lengthiest most mysterious slow introduction, he had, written, yet. the supposed C major work, opens on five, the first triad tonicized, is, B minor... and then he moves straight to A-flat. and that's just for starters. Cherubini, himself is reported to have said quote well to be frank, i must confess that i could not tell what key it was in from beginning to end. we've seen procedures like this before. uh but now i think the withholding of harmonic and thematic definition is taken to a new extreme. now as Mr Froid indicated, this is music that invites, programmatic interpretation, at nearly, every, step. the long scalar descent, at the beginning, not only gives us an important, motive, for further development but at the same time takes us figuratively down our perspective down into Florestan's dungeon cell. i'm not saying that this is that these are the steps of Florestan taking to get there or these are this is Leonore going down after him or and Rocco following uh no but it's our perspective that is being shifted the the the opening gesture commands attention and then we are, led downward into the pit and the groans of the bassoons tell us when we've gotten to our figurative destination. uh the thematic fragment presented in A-flat, is, none other than Florestan's despairing aria In des Lebens Fruehlingstagen the very key A-flat, was associated by Beethoven, with, death, and, dying. there's a story, uh of him saying he had r- responding to the poetry of Klopstock. a German poet popular in the seventeen seventies and eighties. he said Klopstock he he always wants to die he's always in A-flat major. okay this is an association in Beethoven's mind but just not in Beethoven's mind because his contempor- earlier contemporary J-D-C Schubart whom singers among you may know as the author to the text Die Forelle The Trout, uh called this the Graebeton. the key appropriate for graves um G major G major what key are we in? E major? E major, right. pianists who've played the Waldstein sonata, another C major work with G it comes back on the dominant. whoa. now commentators often write this off as a Haydnesque, fausse reprise, a false recapitulation. but i think it was a faux first theme in the first place. now, its structural significance is thoroughly acknowledged. it's a retransition, retransition being the ugly translation of the German wh- what word was that? retro- what? sorry  so who just, opus one-thirty-eight the posthumous, it you don't think it was the first one written is that, third one the posthumously discovered one yeah. yeah 	1

(hate that) what? defend getting a good grade. what you  what do you mean defend? you got a good grade and you have to prove why? i just had to_ i mean people like, you know oh the other students? yeah (xx)  that's why you don't  (yeah me)   how's my oh cuz he_ cuz you came to class. and  check my voice mail oh you know those are Al- yeah, those are Alina's keys... i'm not that uh it's Varina. Joe, you needed to send me an email. i didn't hear  hi i was just trying to check out a book (xx) oh okay. (xx) what is it? she said her, um my computer's not working. her account is inactive she doesn't know why. okay you know you could do some of this stuff. just checking to see why accounts are inactive.  we'll find out. let's see. which account do you use?  should be a student, a graduate student are you a uh, like a, G-E-O or something? or   okay. cuz see both of 'em are inactive and i'm trying to figure out which one i'm supposed to be looking at. okay i'll look at the first one then... whoa. let's see. (V...) three. let me see let me see let me see. eleven, no. no. what's today's day? it looks like the only thing_  twenty-fifth i don't know where's it been? are you, up on the desk i don't know are you currently taking classes? or no i don't have any classes this term. are you registered? um, no but i'm gonna be. i was registered for the summer  is why your account is inactive. well i am a graduate student (xx) well what are you doing right now though? right now i'm writing my dissertation (xx) that should do_ that should be something, but let's see i'm trying to think. do you have any, anything from your department with you or, um i thought that they would like send me a message or something no it just does it automatically. (oh boy,) (yeah well) this is for my, so if i bring you  uh yeah that's fine. i guess. um, it's just policy. what i'm gonna do_ what i mean what are you d- what are you trying to do right now? i'm just trying to check a couple books out. turn 'em in? check them out. check them out. okay. i'm gonna do something i'm gonna just go ahead and, make it active for today. okay  (do you have my) card? i do. just checking  thank you downstairs? downstairs up here, you know. well as long as i'm here. yep, now what is wrong with  yeah um, so, that's two items instead of uh okay, so make sure you see two items. oh no (it's) not here (it) just um, well re- what did you do? it just, beeped off  no okay well just, scan it. (xx)  it doesn't usually say has two items. well you know. you got little electrons running around in the system,  mm yeah it's just electrons being   (is) (xx) (here?) haven't seen him, i think what he said was, you know i need a longer break, i think i'll get here about ten. (xx) no no um, can you guys sign out headphones? am i allowed to do that?  i'm, i'm gonna shut this down. were these just in the, thing, Joe?   uh, no i didn't think so okay good. just making sure. (whoa...) (where's the) barcode...? these are funky ain't they? yeah  that's what i'm worried about cuz, i think the computers here all_ you_ they don't_ you don't have to have a CAEN account though i don't think. uh yeah, just go try it first and see what  it never does this card sucks. it's probably the scanner more than the card. or a combination.  you want to? you know you can get it for free  wow, i'll do that in a minute. no way. that's awesome. what? take one of what? those... i didn't even know that you had the, you could do that. uh you can't. thanks a lot. and this is due, at nine-fourteen. can you remember that? i can remember that. alright thanks a lot. yup. okay. um i need to get a book that's reserved, i don't have the call number i just know the title it's (xx) is it for a class? yeah what class? um I-O-E two-oh-one. two-oh-one? (what's the sheet when you work?) uh you tell me. come on tell me. you forgot? i know there is one. i've seen it. but you forgot. on the two-thirteen, um, in the back where it says reserve processing that sheet. I-O-E two-oh-one?  um Engineering_ it's by Sullivan. okay check it out, we have uh, all of our courses that we have reserve books, are in these binders. you know so the next time, just to make it easier on yourself. just come here, open it up, boom Engineering Economics Sullivan.  (oh i'm not gonna go skiing)  (just that goes on the book?) wait a minute wait a minute. this is what you was asking about right? for reserves? just the information we need to put it in there. she's just     you want it scanned  yeah that's it no      so i just put this back there with the reserve anyway? you know where the, you know where the uh, no you put 'em in the scan bin, in the back. oh s- oh okay yeah make sure both of 'em are marked to be scanned okay scan only, okay.   what,  okay and here's a uh slip to get a new card, from uh, registrar down there.  okay?  yeah  yeah (xx?) hm... is it this fine right here? yes, the_ yeah so  say what? G G-O G-E-O account? um, why did it charge? how long have you had this G-E-O account? oh, for a while. for a while? well i can look into this first, if you want me to. yeah okay w- um they do get fined. okay i've got one of those uh, disks like you gave that girl, like stuck in my computer, and it won't come out of the A drive. is it a Mac? no it's a P-C? yeah um why don't you ask CAEN? they're closed. they're closed? oh  try giving him a uh, paperclip. paperclip? yeah.  yeah (that's long) if you wanna try that i don't know P-C i mean it's just gonna slip right off    yeah yeah   ooh   hm, i don't think we'd be able to do anything. um, you could reboot it. lemme lemme ask back there in back. excuse me  when you reboot it it should go out. reboot it again. the disk'll pop out? i think, i think for the Mac it it pop out. how does it pop out by itself though? for Macs  i i'm not on a Mac i'm, i'm on a P-C. yeah P-Cs always have a button. yeah, and the button doesn't work. is it like there's something wrong with the button  uhuh yeah CAEN's closed, i mean  not   uh, P-C P-C do you know anywhere where i could get tools?  these people are all gone. we i mean we have people that like, do work around the building, but they leave at four. um,  no you sh- is your stuff saved? is it it's all on a disk and i was trying to read it, but is it saved on the  yeah, and now it's stuck in there, and it won't come out. cuz the button's broke... man to tell you the truth i don't know what to tell you man. uh i don't know uh Lona's back there who? who? Lona? no i don't cuz, i never work with the P-Cs yeah they're closed closed? he went over there maybe they're m- maybe they're closed for a business meeting i don't know. yeah but they sh- well he went over there and yeah. i don't know (xx) you think they might know something?  yeah because they might uh, work on P-C  	1
LAB175SU033.json	(xx) scales, and it doesn't have a few scales that have come off another fish and are sort of, hanging around. so you need to wash the fish first, and then measure the total length. um, take three to five scales, where from? (xx) the fish oh, um maybe it's seventy-eight or something. (xx) um i'd assume that you already (xx) why is that? (xx) sixty-four? wash the fish. measure its length. you don't have to put soap on the fish though you don't have to (xx) oh. um, then you take three to five scales where are you going to take them from? thank you. the, (xx) or, the back part well we're taking Rock Bass and Pumpkinseed, so we're going to take it from the dorsal (xx) the pectoral uh the just behind the pectoral fin. okay? put them on two scales, between a couple of scales a s- couple of slides i mean. put them between a couple of slides and keep them wet keep them in water. if you allow them to dry out air bubbles will get underneath everything and the min- meniscus will make it, almost impossible, to see anything. so keep two slides one on top, and um, and measure them. count, the number of rings. then, what we need to do, is fill in a table to start with, which plots... the length of the fish... and its age... for Rock Bass, and Pumpkinseed. (xx) (length in?) beg your pardon? you mean the lengths (xx) (xx) just lengths? yes do the lengths for the minnows first and give me some pieces of paper with those on. okay? so let's get to it. did you get cake? thank you for sharing Brad that was really tasty yeah, thank you Brad thank you Brad thank you thank you Brad he stinks i know he stinks, (man) he didn't take a shower (then) didn't shower why_ you didn't shower? look at him, (xx) he laid down for half an hour.  i'm gonna run down to the lab and get that other, piece of data. okay. you don't shower (take a) shower (xx) move out of bed but like you don't have any (xx) no that's dirty laundry oh. ohh s- (xx) did anybody bring any of the forceps back? Chris is a smelly boy who doesn't wash his body or clothes forceps anybody? no thanks. no thanks. nope, trying to quit. um there's none in those buckets wait. here are some if you have forceps in your project please bring them back. same goes for the thermometers and other equipment you may have.  warmed up...?  gimme gimme gimme remember we had, the lab... well when he comes back we'll turn it back on.   (xx)  (xx) (way) is the lab larger than, this? (now we can) be like  no. yeah? you registered? i register on Saturday,  (5:30) i don't have my coffee cup down (xx) well, bring it (xx) did i leave my coffee cup down on the boat? (xx) (who cleaned off) the boat well i can have him bring it down (xx) i left my coffee cup in the whaler. oh no um then i won't buy a lot i'll buy (xx) what is it? (xx) just regular joe? is it what? what kind is it? flavored or just regular joe? (you have to) (xx) Folgers? regular joe Folgers. Max- it might even be Maxwell House  well that's better (xx) (well,) it's better than that flavored shit. that's what i buy. that's what you've been drinking my flavored shit that's not flavored yeah it is flavored like what? (xx) hazelnut (xx) that's not hazelnut (xx) what's flavored? i think maybe we should just make our own tunes up there's a there's a (manual) over here (xx) (xx) keep it going i think we should keep it going i really think we  oh yeah i think we should break it into a round  row row row your boat oh no no everyone (xx) you guys did not get enough sleep it's questionable what (occurs) here sometimes it's kinda funny when you laugh so hard you cry  well this is gonna look really good for you guys' work isn't it?  (xx) yeah everything is all getting recorded and transcribed no less.  yeah you don't know where the (xx) (xx) tray oh ugh oh (better get outta the way) he might not live do we have the lengths coming in yet? not yet... they're almost what did i do with the disk? it's in the machine yeah man (xx) beer i'll chew up a raw fish i see Chris is awake  (you) eat everything he also did ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall oh God i think we should try that little row row row your boat again i think we should too i think we should just be quiet until (Velana) gets back with the radio... you guys are giddy can you at least (be serious) for two minutes please, i'm serious i'm still measuring how could we possibly be serious? look what we're doing. we're measuring fish yeah yeah this is a  mhm i'm almost done (here) yeah i got a list. you wanna hear it? yeah, here you go no we don't wanna hear it.  don't wanna hear it i don't wanna hear your stinking list that's right unless you can sing it forty-three  shut up can i have it or are you still working? well, you can have it i thought i (xx) i can't imagine (xx) it is (xx) one... two... three... you can count   i like the one that goes my future's so bright have to wear shades. what's that song? remember that one? it's an eighties song (ice ice city) hey let's do it in rounds    okay one two three how about, um things are going great and they will be getting better? is that the one you're talking about Jason? sorry what date is it today? today is the seventh no (xx) it's Huey Lewis, it's not (xx) remember that? oh yeah but i don't know all the words to that here you go Megan where is it? okay gimme some numbers forty-one alright well... i guess we just know it's up here somewhere  okay now what do i need to go here? very weird isn't it?  (xx) we we at this time of the semester they let us have this which i wanted to have all the time just to make it easier  just today because the other classes are busy in the midst of projects so um... oh... (xx) if we could but usually they don't uh, i wanted just a low-level computer in the classroom they wouldn't let me have it this year (xx)  (xx) upgrading to your (laptop) yeah i- it does actually make things tremendously easier so just set up everything that you need beforehand, right? yeah, that's right, there's programs, um... oh interesting, we've got programs for um, a whole bunch of things too which we which we've put in (xx) only one there okay. uh now where was it? um which one did we use the comp- on the computer? all the uh all the um community stuff. the that's all on histograms uh all on computer now and uh basically so you just plug the numbers in. we've got a species diversity thing that calculates diversity richness and all that kind of stuff mhm these are fishes we caught today right? right (xx) it's nice that um (xx) you couldn't do with Macs (xx) we uh_ i i go the other way i'm all I-B-M yeah (xx) it does actually. the biggest problem with having the (xx) in class hasn't been um this so much    but they haven't got the same programs the same levels of um of Excel or whatever it is in the various (xx) (xx) what is worse is that the current stuff isn't compatible with what i have on my computer and that's been even worse Megan would you say this guy is about, three years old? what you're looking for is there's going to be all these rings and there's going to be (xx) what would be black like and star-like on the edge of their fins? black and star-like? dark (darker) i have (some numbers) okay, yes please. could you read them out to me? sure thing. forty-one are you having fun yet? oh okay okay yeah that's a melanophore. absolutely, a beautiful melanophore. little octopus tape type thing. it's the um pigment (set) the same thing we have in our skin that gives us the tan and they look like these little sort of Pac-Attack people probably didn't grow up with Pac-Attack and Pac-Man you know um little sort of star-shaped objects what it is you got some skin on there and the skin has got a melanophore on it if you take a slace of slice of your skin where it was pigmented we'd find the same thing, and the thing is they can expand and contract, there's some control over a number of them and that's how the fish changes color... okay? how are we doing folks with the scales? marvelous darling (xx) with all the fishes that we caught  yes good   yes. you want i- it the then? really. well let me have a look at some. these are? she has one and i have one other oh okay. so it's two years old and sixty millimeters. say, feel free to do more. oh do you want us to do are you including?  like you see the one gap so you know it's one years old and it's on its second year  okay you call it two yes do you want us to like redo other people's? or...  the ones from today, we have have we done all the, all the fishes from today? including the little tiny ones/ (xx) (xx) scales off the tiny ones? yes. and off the tiny ones. hey, here's a sixty millimeter mine was two years old too yeah? and i did one of those (xx) yeah there's still this big old mess of scales (xx) wait a minute, nobody did these right? (xx) minnows   (oh really?) the little teeny ones? i did a little tiny  this one doesn't look like it's been done, but this one has yeah they're not a year old where do we write this information down? overhead here come on dude let's get it together so if it's in its third year do you say it's two? i beg your pardon if it's in its third year yes, then it's, yes (they're) three years old alright now that's a Muskie hanging (xx) does anyone have one that's like four or five years old? this one is like three where? Muskie (xx) pike or (it's) hanging out in the (xx) are we gonna do 'em all (xx) or no? i beg your pardon are there more (xx) i mean do you (xx) a couple they were Rock Bass and Bluegill right? (some of them) were so hard to see because the- they were so little  yes, the the i- in general like they'll all look like this basically? but... yes they'll all look they'll all look alike um that's not the most incredibly good drawing i've ever seen i'm not an artist  something like that yes. where's the focus? oh. for uh on what i drew? mhm  and do you you really have th- the um circuli crossing over like that all over this tail?  okay um, so then it's um, not the most wonderful drawing of a scale that i've seen yes i think this one, has one (xx) how are we doing? good. Pumpkinseeds (xx) um, in looking at the Pumpkinseeds and so on please, do include some of the, young of the year that we've got with their tiny little scales, cuz we want as large a size range as possible. okay? who took my waders? how are you doing? (xx) she told me this was a no   what? yes what're_ they_ a- there are some star-shaped things okay the star-shaped thing_ um, a lot of you are getting star-shaped objects on top of your scales. that'll sort of look like octopuses. okay octopi. these are in fact um, melanophores, which are the source of pigment, and it means you've got a little bit of skin on top, and that's the mal- melanophore in the skin. if someone would like to volunteer a skin sample, we could take a piece from one of you, and see the melanophores in your skin and they'd look similar. i'm not  i'll do it  where you gonna take it from? o- one of the things to, one of the things, is that uh, these will respond to hormone levels and things such as that, and as a result they can change in shape they can get bigger, and and larger so that the fish gets darker, and also smaller so it gets lighter, so it's the change in the melanophore size, which is one of the ways that the fish change color. the fish we saw today were way darker than anything we've seen in a long time, and that's cuz the melanophores have been more expanded and, perhaps that's why you're picking them up so much cuz, i haven't seen as many mela- melanophores as this on scales. as always you're ahead of me. okay so that's what the octopi are... how are you doing? good, i like this i got a lotta,  keep 'em wet. wet. and ke- yes s- sorry what did i say? dry. keep them wet. i was like uh oh (xx) oh i see people are steering clear of the yellow ones... well that nontoxic thing you know. are you eating scales? no are we done with (the fish?) no i haven't seen any of the little ones done. according to this size range, there aren't any measurements of the little tiny ones. how much skin do you have to take off? pardon? how much skin do you have to take off? oh you have to go into the dermis. so you'll bleed. oh. i can do that. how much will you bleed? no we won't. um i don't know is there any blood in you?   (some would say it's cold.) um, you'd have to take a, a a, a small slice, you'd need to get local anesthetic and all those  yeah you can see melanophores in your skin. do it really fast i don't need any stinking anesthetic tough man did i hear you were going to the, He Man con- uh competition at the state fair? no i w- i went last night, to watch it. oh you didn't participate? no i'm too heavy. too heavy. we'll i'd be_ i boxed at Michigan but i'd be a heavyweight in this, in uh in northern Michigan you'd be a heavyweight? yeah. well it cuts off at one-eighty-two and i'm like one-ninety. hmm... these have all been done haven't they? yes. the (xx) county fair's going on right now? yeah. oh that's great yeah it is fun, we went last night, i can't go tonight (because of) homework. can we um i really do want some_ as many of the little fish measured as possible please. alright what're the- where are we getting these? (let's go into) old ones? (let's go into) old ones? where do we get (xx) looking for? i want some one-year-olds and some zero-year-olds one zero-year-old? how can you have a zero-year-old? a one-year-old. it's in its first year... okay we've got, one two three four and five for the Pumpkinseed, but the Rock Bass are really struggling. i got a, i got a four-year-old hundred and fifteen millimeters you got a four-year-old? (xx) i need to look at it. how can you tell the difference between (the wait a minute,) how can you tell the difference between a zero   i saw zero rings (xx) zero rings uh oh well he's in his fourth year i think there's only three, three possibly four bands  clear what up? how to_ if it's got two (ranges) if it's two years old or if it's in its third year whatever you wanna call it. okay. if it's in its first year i'm calling it a one-year-old. if it's in its second year i'm calling it a two-year-old. okay so if it's got what about third year? it's i'm calling it one year old. um, one of the reasons to do that, is that when you have to take logarithms, you can take a logarithm. and so, the- one convention is to d- is to call an a- a fish in its first year one year old. however, some people will prefer to use the human business, and um call them in a zero year old. okay? but we'll use them as one year old if they're in their first year. i've got a new shirt on whoops it might be just breaking up on me i think okay Paul no i didn't who wants to check? and if you want to avoid confusion in terms (xx) on exams, just write down  um, my zero-year-olds are gonna have to be one so the i've changed it okay and then, the one that's fifty-six hang on wh- i haven't got a fifty-six yet. oh that's on the other one, yeah.  you guys have we done everything from today? wh- uh what did we do with our, oh you have it yes i do. i have these fish (xx) one Pumpkin, and then the first (xx) okay if you could write them up but give me the Pumpkinseed. it's one year old and twenty-four millimeters twenty-four millimeters is that normal? one two three? yeah it's_ they really grow that much  well that's what i was thinking. yeah    i'm looking for little ones. so how many rings did you think you saw on that one? i'd say it was in its fourth year you say they saw four rings? a Rock Bass? no i saw three rings (xx) that's the way we're doing it, yes. yeah, that's what i saw. ah. okay so we do have some others for the Rock Bass the, Pumpkinseeds are... okay are we all done on these? i can see people standing around looking,  okay okay yeah i don't_ i think we were getting the smaller ones here. yeah i don't think we've ever really found (xx) little baby bullhead you mean you haven't done the background reading? no i did it. it doesn't mean i recall (everything). (okay so i'm not going to work particularly well...) (mhm) okay where are we at...? can we uh, begin to have a look at these uh data then if we could gather round the screen here... oh hey i'm right by the screen oh that wasn't very good mhm is that (case) selection? or pardon? is that (case) selection? or no no this is individual growth rates not population growth rates okay? um a- and what it's saying is that, when the babies started off little, they grew fast and then tailed off. how many of you um, di- have done any baby-sitting in the last two decades? oh yeah yeah okay. how fast do m- how fast do babies grow? ridiculously fast ridiculously fast they double their weight in? a year? well i can't actually remember cuz it's a long time since i've had things that size, but anyway, um, things? thank you um three kilograms and it doubles in weight so you only have to add three kilograms don't you? but if you add another three kilograms it goes from six to nine kilograms and, the growth rate is obviously a lot lower instead of doubling it's only gone up fifty percent. so one of the things as you get bigger and bigger and bigger, it takes more and more and more, to grow at the same rate. oh, good heavens. um so what you're seeing here is an effect that, although the the the as it gets as they get larger it's simply harder to add on add on material but this is very very typical. fish, typically grow fast when they're young, and also they typically grow fast at the beginnings of seasons. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds for example will put up th- on their annual growth often in ten to two uh ten days two weeks. trout, will put on their annual growth in just a few weeks in the spring. then that's it for the year. hm how do y- how do you determine maximum size (xx) the maximum_ well this is this is the the point um, gimme, wh- wh- y- um, the thing is, maximum size is, i- is rather a nebulous thing and it's rather difficult to determine. yet in many of the models, you're talking about approaching say am- some asymptote. so you, you know where is the asymptote? it's important in defining these models to know where the asymptote is for the the growth models, that are used for ou- for for ou- for p- used throughout fisheries. now if the size range you have that is small, you get something like this, where this is pretty much a straight sort of line, isn't it? mhm it's not what he would (xx) he's not done yet though he may not be done yet. heh heh heh heh. okay. so, if you plot, the age at so- the length at some age against the length at age T plus one what happens? well, the smaller fish is gonna start off_ the younger fish is gonna start off smaller than the older fish isn't it? so that um you're gonna find some sort of number, um, out here where this is going t- if th- you start off here at zero and this is one, then you finish up with something like this and as you go along, the fish uh the the lengths eventually cross this line. at that point you have the L Max. and this is a graphical metho- method for finding it. now, this is set up on the next page and, there's only one word to describe your data... rubbish? no, look what's happened. here if you follow this line along here it would have been beautiful it would have crossed the axis, at about a hundred and twenty millimeters, but, that, those that linear stuff down here, you know this, regular growth rate here, um it's not reaching an asymptote is it? and what you've found is, that it doesn't actually, cross the line. this is extremely common, this is very common indeed. um naturally it's entirely possible that um some of the data, made have made a little bit of a mistake you know in the ages and so on um, (not our data) who wants the bible? i got it twelve inches twe- what's that in? come on now. we don't use inches here. uh... thirty centimeters. yeah and the units we're using are millimeters. three hundred.  we're talking about the certified record not the ones you catch regularly okay...? it is thirty millimeters thirty-point-four-eight, centimeters to a foot. where would you find it? (xx) no i don't think you'd you'd find one. see how it compares? this is an_ illustrates yet another point that it's always a good idea to cross-check your data, and see whether it makes sense. now i know if you find a, thirty pound bass that it really is thirty pounds. okay, mm right? um but it's a good idea to cross-check because you might in fact find you've got a Tarpon instead. you've got a maximum size for these? (xx) there you go (yes) some uh, age, eight years old and a Michigan total length a hundred and ninety-eight at eight years old i wonder what happens if we put those numbers in? how about Bluegill? look up Bluegill yes sir. please. what are you looking at there? Pumpkinseed doesn't  what was the age a hundred and ninety-eight? mhm age was eight ninety-eight yeah a hundred and ninety-eight well that doesn't help either does it...? but, but uh actually i've just realized i've got these axes back to front haven't i? you put that on age six, does it matter? oh yes it did matter didn't it...? what was the length? one ninety-eight oh no s- it_ no we need to (have it) fill in the data otherwise it's not gonna work. anyway there is yet another method, to try and do these things, and that is, it's called the guessing method, and this is where your data really begins to look like hell. um, what you try and do here, um is to guess the maximum lengths. let's say that we guess uh two hundred. whoops wrong thing... put 'em up here. suppose it's two hundred. and that gives us a_ see this line here? it's a hundred and_ what the hell has happened here? nine inches okay and uh, this gives us this line here for two hundred. and uh... what you try and trying to find a line, that's that's reasonably straight and that's working quite well but what happens if we say put in, three hundred here... that's, that's that's uh see that's a weird line that it doesn't look right at all and if we put in say what are the green numbers? um they're just the the numbers i'm entering  these are, guesses of the total length, these are guesses of the total length, and i can't see that can you see that? no the total length? color (xx) okay it's black that's better. see this line is sort of curving down. and what what you do is you put_ what's happening here is you're quite simply putting in an estimate of the maximum length, and you're plotting the log of the maximum length minus the actual length against the age. an estimate of the maximum length at a certain age or just like  so who makes the decisions? twenty-one-year-olds in Washington... great (xx) ah yes i have yes. okay. um... hwuh. as we wind down next week, next week class on Tuesday. having a review session on Wednesday evening, this time Wednesday evening. okay? um, that's Wednesday. do you know what time? uh it'll be at seven o'clock okay um i don't know, i know we're going to (seine,) so (seining) again? no we haven't been there yet, oh yeah well, i'll be around on Thursday morning as well okay woo hoo. alright. (xx) i just wanna know if it's cumulative. of course it's cumulative. so is that the review questions, all the review questions? yeah. um however, you can rest assured, that the questions (xx) that were on the midterm will not be on the final. hmm actually, hmm, y- okay, you can rest assured that they they will not be. okay? are we gonna_ we're gonna have identification again? yes anybody wanna meet on Monday? i beg your pardon? yep yeah you will have okay, the exam will be in the same kind of format as uh, as as it was before, same number of pages the same kinds of material, um you will have had more time to learn your minnows those of you who were um a little shaky last time, um you will uh will be going back into to um, t- fine tune refine your keying and those kinds of things, the skills that you've acquired it should be, fairly simple, the lab exam, we may have more questions on process such as what (gear) would you choose and why and those kinds of things. but it will be very similar to the one before. so we're (keying out) two species we've never seen before right? yes wait two species we've never seen before? yes and how many that we have seen before do we have to key any of those out? you won't have to key out any of those but you will undoubtedly see ones that you have seen before cropping up in, plates. in what? in d- in dishes... dinner can we bring our (xx) um, i'd like to encourage you again. so far i mean i've invited you all the way along to suggest questions you'd like to see on the exams, and so far i have received none. what did (Brae) hit his head on? will the uni- will the unidentified   will they be fishes found in this area? they'll be fishes that they'll be Michigan fishes. they'll be fi- fishes that you can use, the (Hubbs and Lagler) key for so they'll be Michigan fishes.   a- a- they they_ it will be in this area this area being defined as,  marvelous fine fine yeah okay? yeah. do you want to save anything off there or can i enlist somebody to help me, drag (it  	1
LES335JG065.json	alright we have about a m- a minute before we get started and you're probably wondering what the hell is going on i told you i'd swear and i tried not to. i like it a lot better. doesn't it work in this room? no it doesn't it, the room's just too small. so, that's, number one, okay so i like it better like this so if you guys wanna, i get the feeling you're gonna hafta always come in here and redo it. cuz i know, there may be that one person who loves it in the other position and, okay? and i have no control over that person believe me i have no control. mhm that Photoshop book is bothering me because i'm thinking that i'm in i'm in six-forty it's just spaghetti. spaghetti?  is it cold or warm? no i he- i heated it up. heated up, mm looks good are you hungry? pardon me? are you hungry? no i i just went over to the sandwich shop oh, right. i am hungry. you wanna pass that around. i i think i tall- told you the story that i used to teach class from five to seven and i had this one guy come in once with, an entire meal of stewed, green, peppers,  any, um, descriptor term that has the word children in in it somewhere. any descriptor, that contains the word children. whether it's a first word or the last word or if, the word children is embedded in the descriptor, that's exactly right, and so it gives me a shortcut, and then i combine all the previously created sets, for children violence and television. and i retrieve a hundred eighty-seven things which is about right. type out a few, and this whole thing took me a whole two-tenths of an hour which isn't very much. okay? so do you want any of these handouts or you already have one good.  so that's all it took me, it didn't actually take much thinking time. i just sort of expanded from the online thesaurus and then finally did that shortcut of a s- s- s- selecting the descriptor word. if you look at the last page, of this handout. you'll notice, that i... put a big box around... uh all the children descriptors. now of course the use-for terms are not selected but any of those valid descriptors listed in that list, those are the ones i retrieved, by entering the term children, slash D E. and some of you may think that some of these ch- these children descriptors may not necessarily relevant but i got all of 'em. and i was willing to take that risk. so, here's an example of how to do the search using the online thesaurus and an easy shortcut. there are several of you who did this search this past week, and, without going into extreme speci- specifics, about every term you entered um did anyone have a similar experience? anyone use the online thesaurus for that search? okay, and? um i thought it was really pretty easy. um i used it for the term instruction, when i was doing teaching methods for teaching support staff, word processing, and i'd known from the thesaurus i wanted pretty much everything that was, with instruction, in the thesaurus. um, but there was more on the online thesaurus so i did end up having to choose, the terms once i saw it but it saved me typing 'em all in so using the online thesaurus can be a good shortcut. okay let's talk about the search generally there are several people in this class who did the search. does anyone want to relate their experiences good or bad?  oh, i'll share, um, g- DIALOG was extremely slow, so you type along. what time did you, use it? um,  on? Thur- Wednesday. hm yes okay that's actually more typical of like Friday afternoons, although, you know people say like around here on campus, that um, the busiest day is always Wednesday. for example people take off Monday and they'll take off Friday but Wednesday, everyone seems to be at work and everyone's working on Wednesday so maybe what happened was, you know you're just getting that, high load period. um, i had, i had the um, preventing, pregnant teeche- teenagers from dropping out. and i, i had three boo-boos in my, search that i found out. i, had the word, dropouts but it's, one word and i, entered it in as two. so, error number one. so if you're ever in doubt what do you do? do it do it. so i did it both ways but, they still hit a, zero so, with  okay and then, then, after it was all done, i realized when i had, retyped in dropout as one word i forgot the slash D-F so i en- ended up, okay, well, but it's also important to know, oh no, i did it wrong next time i'll catch myself and i'll know how to do that and that's important too. okay any, experiences you wanna share on the first search, the television violence and children, i know there's at least five of you who did that search here and i know you're all very reluctant to speak because you know that eventually your speech, in this class will be up on the web, and you feel so, nervous and concerned about that, you know, you're afraid that you know it says, Wendy Halloway said at such and such a date and so on but they aren't gonna, they aren't gonna identify you so tell me what happened in your search. yeah? i went ahead and did it and, i got about two hundred and fifty hits and, i took each term and did a single set, as i went along, and then combined them, after i was done with each facet. so, it took me a, little longer but uh, i was pretty happy with the results i got. okay, that's fine. that's fine i mean if, if you feel right now, comfortable just, typing in a word, getting Dialog to respond with the set, and typing in the next that's fine. i mean sooner or later i think you'll feel comfortable. stringing several words along, and then combining them. let me just show you some constructions that are possible. quick question does Dialog cut it off at some point? how many can you string along? good question. anyone wanna take a guess? yeah. about eight? about eight terms? mhm no? depends how long the eight terms are. if those eigh- eight terms, are two hundred forty characters, two hundred forty characters forty-seven. forty-seven. you had forty- s- seven characters for data. okay but for those of us old people that used to work in this environment that's what it was like and it wasn't that long ago. so basically you get a, two hundred forty, which is three cards. that includes the blanks that you put in between  really? you have to hit return. if you hit return after you have typed, two hundred forty characters Dialog will respond with what? says command is too long. command is too long that's what it says. okay? i should've, covered that earlier but it's just, one of those many little details that, i, just don't necessarily get to. okay another way you could've, entered this okay is like this, or what was this grandchildren? mhm where would you put the parenthesis in the second line? oh it's the same thing. oh, right here. okay. that's all. um, in uh, uh, in, trying to figure out which uh, descriptors to use uh, i was thinking about antisocial behavior and trying to think to myself, you know would this be a good descriptor for this? and there are no scope notes on it. um, uh so i, i looked at the, i looked at the list of, narrower terms, essentially what they considered subsets, of antisocial behavior. excellent way to do it. uh, okay then, basically it all looked like, it virtually all looked like adult behavior the narrower terms are are, child abuse, uh driving while intoxicated, sexual abuse terrorism there are, a- a lot of others that imply adult rather than child activity and so on that basis, i,  in the absence  mhm uhuh that was why i was real careful before i threw it out. okay. alright. any other questions about the search? yeah? um, one of mine actually e- one of my descriptors was uh television behavior, mhm you got zero? yeah. and it was in the thesaurus? in the printed thesaurus yeah. television behavior? uhuh you sure? i'm  yeah i don't know how televisions can behave either. um, i thought it was just (xx.) maybe it was a (xx) did it have a parenthesis around it? the only thing i can do is go online to take a look to see what happened here. do i wanna save what's cha- (xx?) i don't think so. yeah. were you on something that day or? can you make that  oh yeah but what would i do to find out whether he used a valid descriptor? come on somebody help me out. expand on television. expand? expand what? television would i do a single or double expand? double. double. okay, why?   huh? because that will give you all the descriptors with the word television in 'em. okay and if it isn't used as a descriptor what will happen? will it give me an error message? it just wouldn't show up  mkay let's take a look at it. i'm gonna go expand, television behavior. so, all i can think of is the television like, getting up on two legs and, teletubbies it's not a descriptor. probably isn't used as a descriptor i'm gonna single expand, i would single expand because, if the R-T columns show up, with a posted number, in them that usually tells me this is a descriptor.   it was in the first one   that's what you were doing, watching T-V. let's see about the other one. where's television behavior anyone see? it's in the title. i don't think so. okay well i'm gonna grade their searches, okay  that's a good question, sound okay um, am i not supposed to notice that you are here and all that? it really doesn't make any difference. okay, yeah? um, someone was, showing me a website that had ERIC descriptors on it, and i wanted to make sure that it's, it's a, source that we could use. okay um, it was, do you have the web up? would you like to just type it in here, while we're sitting here? okay anything else about television violence and children? you have five seconds to respond if you do not we're moving on to the next search... it's gone. okay, the next one i wanna talk about, is the pregnant teenagers. and i have another example of a search for tha- this one, which i almost handed out last week and gave you the answers, now i'd hate to do that. this is an online error. and then when you're inside it gives you this wh- outline and all the descriptors and then you check 'em off. yeah okay so what does this do? it, it seems to have the um, the, thesaurus online with broader terms narrower terms relation terms and and can you get it off the library homepage electronic resources, ERIC, databases. yeah the ERIC system now has lots and lots of resources out there for you to use on the web. may actually have the ERIC database i haven't checked recently, is the ERIC database available on the web to s- search now? it may be. this, this kind of is their database. this is their database? okay yeah sure. is this the homepage for it? i, i'm not sure actually. you can get to that okay it was under search ERIC? yeah did you get through it from searching ERIC saying search ERIC? is that how you got to it? no i g- i, wrote in a real long U-R-L. oh okay. search ERIC is just a straight search and then they have this search wizard which is where they show you the thesaurus on the right. yeah this looks to be, from, one of the clearinghouses, uh, of the ERIC system. the, ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation. and i would say, that this is probably just fine to use. okay? okay cuz i looked_ i found some terms that weren't in the, in the book and i ended up not using them just cuz i was oh really? do i do it using search ERIC? there you go uh in the box down at th- further down that way. right here? yeah so if you type um, i wish they had put in, when they started to use this. can you click on the, term? will it let you go any further in? no i guess not. it's blue. very ba- very poor design to have it in blue why? looks like a thing you can open you think that you can select it. these others you can't cuz they have an underline but, this is not a search on, web design, search i don't know it's not a uh, class in web design. okay, um let's do pregnant teenagers students whatever it is. so where are we on the search? how about your experiences doing the search? i don't like my search i think i would leave off adolescence, because adolescence is almost implied by, the pregnant students facet, because they are students and a dropout facet, i mean what else would they be? again the only dropouts that there could be is from Lamaze classes it's the only thing, that's possible that they're dropping out of i- unless they're dropping out of society or life or whatever. okay your experiences doing the search. anyone wanna share them? it was okay. good and i felt very good about it, how many did you get? sixty that's about right. and i, um tested using like forty to fifty i, typed those records to see, what kind of records i'd get towards the end of my search, um why would those be any different get than the ones that you got first? i don't know i just, my experience in searching in general in other systems has been that, usually, people don't wanna wave through to the end. they're gonna look at the first ten depending on, you know what their needs are. this is actually a re- real important point. why should it not matter in this case-searching Dialog? cuz everything, should be, as good, as the beginning searches. right. there is no ranking, using Dialog. at least, this classic, Dialog or Dialog Classic that we're using. a Dialog does have another system called i believe, Freestyle. which does do some ranking. okay? but i think it only gives you the first fifty or, whatever. oh we may get to that or you may wanna do that for one of you s- uh search reports. yeah? so  i had three facets, i did pregnancy, um, teenagers and dropping out. okay  okay okay okay i used, the precoordinated, facet of pregnant teenagers as well as pregnancy, in teenagers and dropping out, okay okay. i'll take a look, it sounds like, there may be, there may be the chance of a logic error, you should be getting around, the sixty seventy how many did this search? how many did you come up with? well, i got a hundred and twenty but i didn't use the slash D F on dropouts sixty? sixty one hundred forty-three. one forty-three. i'll take a look okay it's too wide well you have an or in there maybe it's like the way we discussed last week, i'll take a look, you know it may have worked, you know. let's take a look. did you use all your D-Fs and limit it to descriptors? yes. okay good. cuz you may have had the same problem as the person who didn't, okay any other last thoughts about this search...? you're all so strangely quiet. support staff. and a facet for word processing. okay were there any others? teaching  teaching methods? okay. anyone wanna relate their experiences on this search? you can even say if something went wrong you know i won't get angry at you now, well i had, i forgot to put the slash D F in at the end of my, or-ing and um, i came up with eighty-five which wasn't huge, but i got a lot of help-wanted ads which, i probably would've gotten rid of, if i would've put in the D F? you got help-wanted ads? yeah i got like, three help-wanted ads in my first six. no, were you searching ERIC? yeah. no, oh i guess it was a survey, a help-wanted ads survey kept popping up that wasn't good. there must be some, descriptor combination, with those that's, resulting, in retrieving that yeah mhm not much i don't think i don't think so. mhm  okay. no. i went ahead and for um, the support staff facet i ordered all my terms together but i didn't do the parentheses, slash D F i just put D F after, the two terms that needed it. that's fine okay so there's no really no that's fine, you did fine. so she just wants to, basically whenever she entered a v- one word, descriptor she put the D F as opposed to putting a parenthesis, in in the D F at the end. th- a- that is parenthesis around everything and the D F at the end... any other questions? comments about this particular search? (we didn't, did we do this?) we didn't do library service to physically handicapped that was five yeah. okay, library services to phy- physically handicap. d- yes? um, i completely screwed mine up. and you know why. yes. and i, don't know why i did it but okay. did you have it right on your,  or your, okay. well i'll take a look at e- you know, it's good_ did you realize then when you were online when you did that or after you signed off and you, stewed about it for awhile? after i stewed a little while. okay, and, this is sometimes typical, when you're first learning how to search. that's why i try to say don't revise online, because sometimes it does take you a little while to sort of figure out, what exactly did i go wrong, where i wound up with, zero or i wound up with, thirty thousand, you know sometimes, when you're online it's just too hard to assess that. yeah unfortunately i also messed mine up i think all of us who did number five uh i would have to take a look at your search to actually tell you exactly what went on... my guess is, and i'm i'm this is just my hunch, um, that again you may have used an or, instead of an and. that's a possibility. or you may have used, an and, but perhaps on the wrong set. physical disabilities, and then not-ing out mental retardation  mhm physical disabilities physical disabilities, uhuh  bookmobiles libraries library acquisition library extension, li- library surveys public libraries reference services, it goes on and on. okay. build that. then i'd create your second set, for your physical disabilities. yep right that's what i did. i um, got a reasonable number of sets, two ninety-six, for the results, but the way i did it, i think i really, uh screwed up the um, uh the wha- what's the Cutter's law. um, library services, i generated by, y- there're a lot of specific descriptors with not many man- many narrower terms simply used anything, uh that you know looked appropriate, from the scope notes. uh, and then we go to physically handicapped and other handicap was just my shorthand and um, then something like developmental disabilities it'll be four or five under it. um, i used developmental disabilities instead of listing all those under it. uh i got a dozen terms there, and about uh, and eleven nots. hm  (looking good.) i think there's one more. no there was one more there was the eating disorders  not much to say i did it sort of the, very simple way just listed out all the descriptors and, put them into or-ed sets and then and-ed them together and i got ni- nine results. she got nine results. were you, were you concerned that you only got nine? not especially guess she leads an e- easy life. any of any the rest of you get, nine or more or fewer? i got nine exactly too. did you, use each other's papers and look? no. you're sure you didn't do it together? i'm sure i can vouch she's in my session yeah i'm in her session i'm not in her session. okay but you could've gotten together beforehand. i did yeah um, i probably, i screwed up royally. but you got four hits? yep oh. well i'll i'll take a look at it see see what it, what facet did you leave out? teenagers. actually that was the least important facet why? why? because eating disorders occur in teenagers, mostly. i heard it. eating disorders occur in teenagers,  in broken homes they're of- more often talking about kids from broken homes now yeah. you know this search does not have a lot of citations attached to it. there just is not, a lot of literature out there about this particular hypothesis. i'm waiting for someone to do their dissertations on it by the way. guess the linguists won't do it, we'll worry about the psychology people. that's good to know. okay. now had he left out the broken homes facet i would've worried. because he'd've gotten a lotta citations on, teenage, eating disordered, kids. okay? which is not nece- i mean that's nice, but we wanna know a little bit more we wanna know, if their eating disorder, uh i'm sorry if they came from a broken home and that had played a role, in their having an eating disorder. okay? any, last-minute thoughts on this particular search? there's gonna be a lotta i couldn't help myself okay let's have 'em. and then you're like, shit, i forgot, you're like, you can't go back, i have to, i just have to my key was to do 'em quickly okay we have a few minutes until we break and i wanna get started on Freetext searching. cuz i know a lot of you, have been saying but i wanna do this. okay? and, you've been playing my game up to now now we're gonna play a different game. we've been for the most part only searching controlled vocabulary. this is the, vocabulary, that an indexer, some human being, has decided, is relevant, to a particular document and assigned that terminology to the document to represent that document's intellectual contents. yeah you can set your screen saver to go_ wait twenty minutes or something (so it won't go) it's just so, disgusting. let me, let me try it cuz i did it to my computer last night i hate it huh? yeah i i just, everyone's looking up there looking at it wondering, what the heck it is. let's see. do you want me to, enable the screen saver get rid of it? yeah. would you enable it? you can, by clicking    want me, just get rid of the whole entire application? no no no i, i think he wants it, it's ena- disable the screen saver? yeah disable the screen saver, yes sir. there you go. okay, why don't you put on this ERIC wizard that's a lot more pleasant to look at. sh- sh- should i leave it just like that? that's great. thank you. you're welcome. we'll probably get in trouble for doing that but, anyway. okay when these search retrieval systems were first built, for the most part they only searched the descriptor field. cuz it was sort of cheaper to do it that way. in fact years and years ago, before there were online systems, you used to actually, go to a search analyst, tell them what you wanted, and a programer would actually write out your search, using those little eighty-column punch cards, put it into the, computer, come up with a list of accession numbers and you'd have to go, to the books, called (era) to, look up the citations that it retrieved. but through the years, through the years, computers became a lot more powerful, and also became a lot cheaper for them to actually store, the text, of the bibliographic, records, in, an electronic database. so, the online searching of the entire text of a document, whether it be a full-length journal article, or whether it be a citation, to a journal article, became possible. that's not to say that one of the first, demonstrations of online searching way back in the late sixties, okay, when you guys were born, or maybe some of you weren't even born then? tandy the tandy fields author? author, publisher what else? language language. name of the journal, number of pages, publication information all that sort of stuff okay? we're only talking about, title abstract no descriptor identifier. alright? so the first field it encounters if it's is its own accession number that's not a tandy field so let's skip that. the next field it en- it encounters is the title field. and so what it does, and the system is doing this not a human being a computer system. and the computer can do this very quickly and very efficiently. computer system starts to number, each word in the field and preface, the n- word, position information or the word position number, by the name of the field so in this case we have T-I, word number one is post-purchase. word number two is consumer word number three is evaluation. word number four in the title is complaint word number five in the title is actions. oop, what happened there? stop word it's a, called a stop word and what is a stop word? anyone know?   they're pretty common words. they can't be searched, because they aren't indexed. so they aren't indexed so you can't search 'em. okay? now what i want you to notice, that the word and, the sixth word in the title, it's not indexed, but notice how, its number is six. but six is not there so there's really no title word six, the next word is seven. repurchase, and then, the last word in the title number eight is behavior. now this, this becomes very important because if you have a phrase that you wanna search... if one of the words in your phrase is a stop word, you're gonna have to account for that particular word. problem is it isn't indexed in the system, but it's still numbered, there's still a number, left over from it in the text. so there's a title word six it's never indexed. but it's still was there it existed. okay? sort of like a tree falling in the forest. the word is there, you saw it you heard it... computer saw it it heard it, and it, numbered it but it just didn't index it. it's a stop word. and there's a whole mess of stop words, for a lot of computer systems in fact if you turn over, on the back of this little hy- handout. you will find that the stop words right at the bottom, for the ERIC, f- for i'm sorry for, well in particular the ERIC database but, also, Dialog in general, are cuz it's not on there cuz it's not on there? yeah that's a good answer.  is the first one an or on? on i believe... cuz a isn't on there i would doubt it.  um, it's an i i have   okay an it's not on it's an. it would make sense because they're in alphabetical order mhm what are the numbers in parenthesis in the D-C in the what? the numbers in the parenthesis in the descriptiv- descriptor field? that is a descriptor code. i really don't wanna deal with that. that is a um, a prefix-coded field, should be, descriptor code, this is for a different database it's not for the ERIC database so mhm okay, let's go. do you have everything Bonnie? i can finish collecting it when class is over. okay if you just finish those sheets i'm sure that, the MICASE project would appreciate it and, i appreciate it and, maybe John Swales will take me out for a, good birding trip, if he doesn't i'll be on his tail... actually i believe, i once you know encountered him along the river, and uh, like six, horn grebe came by, i can't i can't remember it's the first ones i'd seen i thought, just because John, the great John Swales how does it index phrases? like how does it recognize a phrase as it's going through? i'm on my way. okay. okay? on my way. now, if you wanna search for a single word, it's real easy. alright? if i'm just interested in the word farm... i'm gonna look at my database index in the back, by the way, this, silly little black thing is dying okay? do you know where i could get another one real quick? mhm yep mhm. yes okay of what document? three-oh-one-six and that's the document we would retrieve. and it's just as simple as that. three-oh-five-six three-oh-five-six... we're almost there. twelve word number, twelve or title, word number nine. is it? yeah yes well it's for both so it, we don't necessary retrieve it once, or twice we just if it, satisfies any one of those conditions just find it once, we've got it, so we retrieve that record. and that's how Dialog does the simple case, of finding, a phrase in text. that's exactly the way it does it. i couldna put it any easier. so basically what it does, is it, numbers all the words in the tandy fields, including stop words, although it may assign the number, it never indexes the word. and then, it does this fancy little, checking in its algorithm to find out, if it's the, same document, same field, and the words are with one word of each other plus, the first word, has one, the document nu- the document, i'm sorry the word position number is one less, than the word following. okay? there any spaces in there at all? there can be if you want but it doesn't matter i wouldn't put spaces it's easier to read without 'em. there's another way s- to say it, you can also say farm, parenthesis parenthesis women. now let me stress, one, more, time. farm must always precede the word women. okay? that's all. that's what word adjacency is in this case. yeah? can you do this with more than one word? like  it's not adjacent. it's not adjacent. those words are not right next to each other. so what we wanna do it loosen that construction a little, okay? so we have, two words, intervening. okay? any two words, intervening.... so the way in which, i express this, is to say, two-W. and i'll retrieve that. three huh? three come on guys, you should all say in unison, three. it's numbered. it still counts. i'm sorry someone sa- was saying? i heard you say it. hello? the same thing they said. it gives it as the_ it leaves space for and even though and's not really, right great, so what do i wanna change this number to? three. three. three-W. i could probably make it five-W or seven-W or ten-W or eighteen-W, and i'm sure there's an upper limit i think the upper limit was twenty-two or something i- i never can remember. but, you know it's a sort of rule of thumb. if you want it adjacent it's W. if you want it sort of, nearby three-W. and if... you know you're willing to sorta maybe make it, maybe in adjacent sentences i may say something like nine-W. but i rarely use that. okay...? is everyone clear, up to this point? i have one question. yeah. um on the first example you gave i thought it said farm, comma urban, was it farm comma urban women? no  oh rural women? okay. there's one intervening word okay okay  right okay um, one-W two-W three-W means precisely precisely two precisely three it doesn't mean three or less? yes it does oh it does? this means, i will retrieve, two words adjacent to each other. this means i'm gonna retrieve, this one-W, means, i'm gonna retrieve farm women, oh that's three. three there are three words so that would only come under the three-W. but the three-W would get this this and this, ah if for example we, are willing to get uh, one two three four five-W but not twenty, is there a way to put it say, one through three-W? you're essentially saying that. okay? if you say three-W, you're also saying two-W, one-W and W. okay what about do searching farm women working in farm? how can we do that? i'm sorry say that again. farm woman, working in, farm. yeah? well you got it with farm women working in farm. i think i, know what you're saying. let's say your construction is more like... order word order it's the word order... there's a solution. we're gonna lose it, u- lose. yeah we're gonna lose. hairy animals hairy animals. what's the difference what's  W, is word adjacency. the word in the first position that you give, farm, W women, must precede the word women. yeah peanut butter and jelly. oh now there's a good one. it's four um,    i thought the and was two-W you have to give space for that so how do i give space for it? two-N? one-N? what am i am i gonna i gonna keep it in there? no get rid of it. how do i get rid of it?    i erase it? two-W. one-W it doesn't matter one or two it's gonna, maybe i get peanut butter banana and jelly.  it's a stop word. and it existed, but, we never, and we numbered it, but we never indexed it. okay? so we still have to account for it. another one, good one is slip of the tongue. yes is the a stop word? yes so what do i put down? two-W. two-W tongue yep. got it. give me another, but, we had peanut butter and jelly now someone give me another one. knee-jerk reaction. what? knee-jerk reaction. that's, even better for another reason... okay help me out you said it Wendy. parenthesis parenthesis jerk. jerk, parenthesis parenthesis that's all. that's all that's to it. mm what if it were hyphenated? would it would it make a difference.   what about knee-jerk reactionary? nope. let me think of a file it might be in, um this is silly aw shoot. (xx) we found one reactoin yep. wow what database are you in?   it happened with anti-social. i did, on my search, with the hyphen and it collapsed it to one. it did collapse it. it didn't do it for me. i did anti, hyphen social, yeah okay. alright? so are you convinced? you have to put in both ways. but there are no hyphens in Dialog so it won't nec- if i say knee, hyphen jerk. it won't get anything. it shouldn't. cuz it's never indexed hyphens. so it takes those two words, which are hyphenated, drops the hyphen and concatenates the the two words together to make one word. okay? uh, yeah, yeah? i'm sorry. i can see why you wouldn't want to exceed those limits, you were just, looking for nonsense. you get the, you get, uh, the word, that you were looking for though wouldn't you, i mean it's, it's silly and it's not elegant and you might get into a lotta garbage in there, but would it exc-? that's essentially it. if i'm looking, if i know the title of a document. okay? in fact, let's say i wanted to retrieve, the first document here, colorization  coloring? no that's three oh we're saying any, two characters. colored, c'mon guys.   it's Spanish it is?  well why don't you say an E there? is that just no E S oh a- how about singular?  C O L O R? yep. okay.   yep yep that's the Spanish. okay? and how about, the English spelling with O U R? no, because our stem is C O L O R right three question marks? question mark question mark, question mark. and that then gets me, everything before, colors, colored asterisk? C O L O R question mark and that's it. that's why one character is in C L s- c- just a single question mark. the question mark que- space question mark. okay communist huh? communication communist communication committees committees yuck. commuter commuters, communism, commercialism, you know just to- two topics that are real similar commercialism and communism. publicity pubic well i'd heard it. i'm gonna be on tape puberty, okay and the list goes on. so you get the message. if you enter in something like that, what happens? okay? a- was, what does that give me? women woman and the variant womyn with a Y you're right. very good. i forgot about this. women woman, and, the much more P-C-oriented womyn... i never thought of that thank you. what a sensitive man girls. um, color and  O R or maybe or O U R    yeah, so, i mean if you really wanted to use your question marks you could say C O L question mark question mark R and get both kinds. no you aren't because the word that you're gonna get has one two three four five six characters in it. and the word you want C O L O R only has five characters. so it's not two or less in this case. no ma'am. every, question mark means any character. mhm yep. go ahead. no way for cost of living? cost of living. and why don't we have the of in there? it's a stop word it's a stop word and it's never in the database so if they put, cost, parenthesis end parenthesis of parenthesis end parenthesis, living you get a big fat, goose egg. zero, cuz of isn't in there. on the system we went through and did it so a logical combination gets zero. next one is slip, two-W tongue. to accommodate for the of the, which are two, stop words. yep we actually have th- it on the handout. you do? yes oh. well why didn't you tell me? i wouldn'ta spent so much time standing here. cuz it's share of the market share of the market excellent. say it louder and clearer. share of the market? share of the market. so you can take market share, turn it around to say share of the market. in one it's an adjectival phrase what's_ in the other it's a what...? share of the market. preposition? yeah. there's a prepositional phrase in there. and i'm not real good on my English it was fourth grade and boy it was boring, and i remember those days. i do i even remember the book sort of bluish and white and everything. everyone hated it so- i didn't mind it. and, i guess i learned to hate it cuz everyone else didn't like it. you know how it sorta the peer group t- telling you that English was not your thing. in any case um, you'll find a lotta the constructions that, you, try to go use, i mean, it's the same thing as farm women, women on a farm women, of the farm, women who farm, take those constructions that you're gonna find and think of this particular week for your Freetext search that is also graded... and take those constructions turn them around, try to take an adjectival phrase and make it into a prepositional phrase. okay? so take something that makes, logical sense as a, W and turn into an N. you can do that with descriptors, you can't enter the descriptors but you sure can enter the descriptors as Freetext term. if you're looking for junior high school students i would be, damn sure i'd say junior W high W school truncated. i have a distracting question. i have some handouts. well it goes back to_ somebody over there asked it before and you said we'd get to it but we didn't which was how does the, machine automatically find the phrases when it's creating this little index? the same way it found the phrases before, i mean, the way in which i'm telling you. but i mean here, it's created phrases with some words not others right so, presumably it's me, go ahead. those are phrases from a descriptor field. so it's matched them. yeah well it ha- somehow knows, within the descriptor field that it, beco- it has to look for phrases as well as, a whole bunch of other stuff. remember two weeks ago when we talked about how it indexes for descriptor fields? mhm it's just, including, in the BASIC Index, the descriptors, as phrases. so every phrase in there, is a descriptor. got it. thank you okay, thanks  got one. yep did you get one? good. alright, have another one. okay. i entered forced, or tree or pine or fruit. truncated. then i entered seed, within three words, on either side of, seed dispersal, or dispersing of seeds, or dispersing of many seeds, seed within three-N of scatter, of replant or plant. so i'm gonna get seed replanting replanting of seeds, planting of seeds, planting of many seeds, okay? many constructions i could make out of that, and then squirrel or squirrels, squirrel truncated there's probably nothing else i can get but squirrels or squirrelly. actually kinda i'm ready to hit somebody mkay, children violence and so on violence why didn't i just, type violence in again? S-two is shorter huh? S-two is easier. yeah S-two it's already created and furthermore, DIALOG has to search, and it has to make its engines drive its engines in order to search and if you search it twice you have to pay for it twice. four-oh-two i have huh? four-oh-two. oh really? yeah? four thirty-one. really? you sure you used D-F? that was the first one sorry. oh okay. how about for your controlled vocabulary search? last week, how many did you get, for this one? uh, one one thirty-nine. one thirty-nine. okay we've used the same words that we used before but we've truncated their stems and we've used a few synonyms. and look how many we've already, now i don't know if you wanna read, four hundred fifty-four things, i don't know if i wanna read 'em. but you can see how, we can increase, the amount, by using Freetext because now we are searching all tandy fields. okay? any questions about this? yeah can you, do anything to save machine time for the next time you log in to go get a sear- try to get a search that you were using previously? or do they just disappear as soon as you log off? how long you wanna be here? yeah just one thing if you save them too long then you lose, updated, articles wouldn't you? no it re-executes the   okay. okay? i'm sorry if i'm not_ was not clear. so you have this saved search, but when you, call it up it executes it right there at that moment. so what it's doing is saving your, essentially your command string.   okay, last thing i'm gonna talk about. gonna give you a search to do, you're all gonna do the same one. oh no aw and it's not children violence television, aw consumer parenthesis at the very least, at the very least, you're gonna enter it as consumer, right question mark so i get consumer, adjacent attitude, or attitudes. at the very least. okay? go to thesaurus, pick out your terms. now, how else could i express this? think about this. you have consumer attitudes but don't consumers also have attitudes?  N how many N? one at least two at least two, and one N doesn't buy much at least put two N i never use one N. and you might wanna truncate, consumer because it could be  parentheses parenthesis two-N, question mark. what does two-N buy you? give me some constructions that this gives you? help them so we can get out of here. environments of urban communities. great, environments of urban communities what else? environment influencing urban youth. good great. in fact, environments, influencing, urban delinquent youth. oh no mkay before you go, uh you knew you weren't out of here Meredith i don't know who you are, or where you were sitting. i'm Meredith. uh let me see,   	1
OFC280SU109.json	my, and then once i solve for X-two that's my demand, function for X-two or that's your specific, choice given this income and price, if you wanted it to be a demand function then you wouldn't have plugged in the number twenty-four here you would have an N there,   mhm is it better to do it that way?  mhm okay so this gives me the specific right. so that gives you, that specific point. if you're asked anything but what is the specific point, you're better off working it general. okay  okay so if you don't plug in the numbers, mhm   they're just gonna equal each other so that's gonna be like, P-two X-two plus, P-two X-two, equals M. exactly now solve that for, X-two and you'll have a demand function. okay now i know where_ i think maybe that's where i was screwing up i was st- trying to put the numbers in and i wasn't getting the demand like exactly.  right  see and i knew it was a dumb mistake but it's like you know when you look at it for so long it   okay... (xx) function. but it's because you stuck in, the numbers okay so, you know what then i think i'm fine because that's where my big problem was so i'm gonna, i might be back tomorrow but,    no so if the question says this is the hardest part of this  mhm yeah  and this is the Cobb-Douglas demand that i keep talking about. it's   and then w- wh- what i did in lecture is i, took it one step further and i said if this is X-one to some power C, i didn't do it in lecture i did in section X-one to some power C, and X-two to some power D, mhm so X-one, X-two (xx) so it's gonna be, C plus D over for d- demand for X-one, is equal to C over C plus D,    over P-one. and then X-two is gonna, D over D plus s- no. yeah. yeah D over  right  mhm  okay, that makes sense. but don't use N if it's not Cobb-Douglas. right. actually maybe can we go through one that's not Cobb-Doug- mhm number two wasn't Cobb Douglas. oh okay. like for the Ambrose   so that's so first thing you do draw a picture... and you don't know the prices so just make some, downward sloping budget   okay more curved for the quasi-linear yeah cuz the quasi-linear's shifted straight up so you wanna be sure that you, you're looking kind of like that. mkay. so okay and then you can just solve for X cuz there's only one variable in there so you can just solve for that X-one, and you're done. how h- wai- how do you, just come up with that so fast like,  two is a exactly and there's no X-two in there. okay  exactly. right  if you had prices,  okay, so how would i, get X-two from that though? you'd need your budget line.  okay. sounds good. alright i so they're all a little bit different. right  but the big thing this one it says, you always want the same amount of X-one it doesn't depend on income so you get, that income offer curve that we've been talking  okay, alright okay. thank you very much for your time. i appreciate it. mhm. so i will see you tomorrow in class? tomorrow in class and, bright and early and w- work with some more of those i mean the  mhm okay, yeah i will i'll i'm gonna go through a lot of 'em again, so thank you. mhm. um, yeah i'm a G-S-I. okay. i just Andrew Andrew you're, sitting in our meetings that's why you  um, Friday, yeah so we'll survive. yes. and um, also this sounds even worse today this morning i wasn't here for lecture, and i just wanted to,  was it really the best?  yeah she caught me. she caught you? well i i had to talk to somebody ask uh   that's alright. mhm. oh okay i see what you're saying. then we went carefully over incidence, um reminding us what the tax is and, we have elastic inelastic and by the time we got done i had put, all this stuff up  yeah (xx) compare E to E-prime, hi how are you   yeah,   yeah  yeah yeah uhuh yeah, okay... alright that makes sense. and that's that's it for today so, we're gonna pick up on, on consumer choice and what we'll get to is this, um conclusion, but we won't explain it very well so we won't have indifference curves, okay so it's more intuitive than, exactly. exactly more intuitive. and a lot of the time we'll be just be doing what's in the (xx) yeah. very right. the class was good they were mostly there and they seemed to be, following so yeah they seem, they seem to be pretty good, all the quizzes that i have (have been,) fine, so far       yeah yeah they_ i come early.  yeah yeah  okay email me so i w- we can be sure i'm not in class. okay, okay, i sh- hm. w- well think about it  okay, yeah hi Miss Gaston, hi hi Simon um i have a question about um, my econ major i'm gonna, study abroad at uh, University of New South   yes.  mhm three-twenty and you're a junior? yeah. so you're right on track.    it's through U-of-M,  yeah yeah so like um, i mean there's, i guess this is four-oh-two  like if i take it there would that cover my four-oh-two  it would yeah it is yeah. hold on i just lost your, stuff, what i was going to do, is write in it. um and like, would basic_ let me tell you our basic criteria first you need to take four-oh-one here,  okay that's not a problem. yeah      okay okay  okay   okay okay alright okay oh  okay  okay great. yeah that's the only question i had because i, i have to figure it out by the end of this week whether or not i'm gonna go through with it or not. and then if you only take one econ course there you'd need five coming back your mhm that's fine like uh, i mean i was planning on taking uh four-oh-two i guess, my senior year, but uh i might just get it ov- done with like there i mean   yeah yeah  yeah  okay  um  um, one more question, since this is through uh U-of-M do you know if th- the grades transfer also or? ask,  yeah yeah, okay i guess i'll, find out on that but that's basically it. but, thank you,  good idea it can be anything chapter five six eight or nine, which is what we've covered the last two weeks. okay. it's very similar like it's just, progressing yeah exactly so you, probably have to know things from two and three and four   yeah okay thank you.  Nan? hi. hi it's your office hours right now   okay pardon me? how are you doing? uh i'm okay, how 'bout you? oh keeping busy. um, lemme just brush this up and we'll be fine. oh were there?  so when you um excuse me do you have, a um, directory for the campus? i'm looking for a guy named Joe Krachek in the high C highly interactive, computer technology group, so far i've been to every building (xx) i don't think you're in the right building.  the scho- the Business School? no wh- i've been there, i've been to the Social Work have you been to the Business School there? yeah i started there. oh. let me see, (xx) (i don't think it's in here) and that's all i know. no. well he used to be back over there on the first floor. and he moved    oh. they've got twelve twenty-one A S-E-B. so that's School of Education. bu- yeah they're not there now. i know that, cuz his hi- his room number's fourteen, fifteen. uh, i have no idea what happened. would somebody in the School of Education know cuz they were in that building? they sent me over here. wrong building.  do you think he might have the same phone number? i don't know. can we try it? yeah. what is it? uh, zero one two, seven four one nine. can you reach it? yeah sure... nope he doesn't. uh, let's see if they've got, how about like, units like th- the    what is this building? this is Lorch Hall.         P-one equals  and so there's indifference curves... and there's, my shifting budget lines... so it's just like a bunch of,  it's the whole thing okay yeah, okay well you know, when you have quasi-linear preferences that the, tangency equation will let you solve directly for your optimal amount of X-one unless, it goes negative and then it's  okay this is okay so why is there no income offer curve? i- because it's a typo. okay, that's what was totally confusing me. let's try doing that. okay thanks. see you're in better shape than you thought right? no, cuz th- this section corresponds to (xx) and th- what is that M over P-one or something like that? mhm then you're up here well what about for this income offer curve? then it would just be, only X-two.   because it's not getting cheaper. so if you can buy ten units of X-two, oh this is with the price of X-one change. exactly. okay. okay  right  one is greater i guess yeah but yeah    mhm i had um, a question on an exam, many_ several years ago, and, you couldn't answer it, in the case of um, perfect substitutes with a budget line having the same slope, exactly the same slope as, the indifference curves. and i had a student during the exam ask me about that. oh yeah okay right right... okay well, right here so i put my, B there, A to B is, substitution income effect huh? okay yeah, that makes sense if you're consuming both goods, initially. and that is a, exception if you stay on the same boundary, all income if you switch boundaries,  and the other one is what if you're on, a bump? okay it says in here that, the, quasi-linear preferences, mhm that's all, substitution effect  on the angle then there's an income effect,  okay. cuz it just_ the book made it sound like it was all right so that has to be you have to qualify that, with the fact that you're in this part. right what did you guys already talk about? lots of different things,  oh just the practice exam. oh okay i was gonna do that in a minute so.  is it? yeah no i wouldn't call it easy. i don't know, for this one no that's later and i, it hasn't even come up yet. the other one (xx) probably have to. (xx) i know. okay. (we're gonna start) hey i've got a crowd why don't you, grab a chair and join us. your name is? Kimberly. Kimberly and you're? Janki Janki. yeah. oh  oh okay. okay looking at workbook, things, (xx)   okay.  mhm it is just like the mama bear problem uh um why don't you grab a chair somewhere, Matt and join us. and we're scared. i mean i mean more than,   okay um, so i set up their, the different people's,  this is a, a hard question. oh is it? okay. i don't understand okay. the key is that they're sophisticated voters. okay so  so watch what happens if light goes against dark, okay right. mhm mhm okay okay. mhm okay who's going to get their worst  so this isn't going to work but if you look at, i mean what i would do is run through the three here,  okay   okay uh with sophisticated. okay  okay will win  yes. wow  i know i was like this is like mama bear, i  and it is but it's the sophisticated, okay, oh i had a question about the angle curves  like what are we doing with them? yeah... cuz i understand we did that Twinkie one before that right?  angle curve on, this. yeah uhuh okay, and you don't have to j- go by numbers you just draw a sketch that  okay okay  okay alright  okay and you can do one for X and one for, Y angle curves separately  and then    okay (it was actually) (xx) but i was just curious like could you explain the when you have a backward, why when you get an inferior good do you get a backward bending, angle curve? i know hold on (when you get an inferior)   okay. when you have a normal good you could get, a backward bending, supply. so what we need look at to begin with, is an endowment model or we can't, understand that. so here's the endowment, and let's say the consumer's original choice is here. so what's the consumer doing? they're gonna sell X-one but  so could i just ask a quick question  correct. okay oh yeah that's right okay okay. so what if they go to there? mm  okay so which income effect is that? (like i totally) it's the combined income effect. okay so but one goes up and one goes down. um, w- yeah we're only ever looking at the combined income effect. well w- how do you get the combined income? i mean uh y- y- substitution effect says draw a line, through the original choice, okay is always, okay so the difference between the two is always the rest of this. yeah the rest of it. so pivot is substitution shift is income. okay, alright so what does that say about, that but this is a, a normal good then. correct  wh- well what, first of all what you can say is to get a backward bending, supply curve it must be a normal good, okay mkay you want to consume more what about with perfect complements? perfect complements. okay what would happen? one for one? yeah yeah income? selling more so, those always have backward bending supply curves? mhm (xx) substitution effect. if the substitution effect is zero you will get, backward bending supply yes. okay. with the income effect there's no, ba- excuse me with perfect substitutes there's no, income effect? depends. what's it depend on? it depends on the price change. okay but it's gonna be on one of the other (xx) as long as you s- you're on a boundary yes. (so that sort of) answers the questions you have right? okay (xx) that was about the last one i had um, w-... okay i guess i have one more question, we're not asking questions about Edgeworth boxes are we today? you can if you want well i'll just  do you have your course pack  (xx) thank you my coursepack walked away i have to get a new one. what page is it? yeah he says i- when you go north on the indifferen- okay, if if you're go north and it flattens out so what he's saying is, if you_ here let's see if i can draw this. so i'm looking at going north first of all so that's going north.  okay oh so with the next intersection? right so going up, s- s- so they don't cross, um going up, okay i was thinking he meant on the indifference curve that's why i was, so confused. no he means going s-   if it was normal. and then by definition it's not, normal because income goes up consumption of good one just went, oh okay alright  oh okay i see alright i have a question on twenty-six. okay get your course pack back, before i steal it. alright the price where she's, neither a seller nor a buyer?  right. so if i look at, the endowment twenty forty so it would be a point like that, okay when the price is equal to... when P-one is equal to P-two?   yeah  okay  mhm two okay mm  okay. mhm what the okay. um okay i was wondering about this point rationing. okay  okay okay oh okay. but it's actually, this line.  okay okay. okay you can skip around cuz (xx) (xx) i completely don't get that but i don't have any other,  that whole graph right there.  okay what it's showing. is we've got two constraints. so i'll do one in black, and the other in red. okay? and then what we're doing is we're wondering what happens, when, the red constraint goes up and down. okay. so in terms of like food coupons how would these two constraints    okay. okay. okay till you reach that  right okay mm okay mhm mhm okay okay so, what is what exactly oh okay okay. solve this point, you'd have, the tangency equation plus the coupon, equation. to solve any of these points you'd have a tangency to the red line equation plus the, red line equation. but any of these points, are just the intersection of the two budget lines. mhm, so you wouldn't do the slopes? wouldn't do the slopes. do the equations  so these are all the kinks. (right?) correct. but as the budget set's getting bigger so the red line is moving out, the kink would, move, you know it woulda been here then it would be here then it would be here and then finally the kink doesn't, matter anymore because you have so much income that you're constrained, only by, the coupon constraint. okay yeah, you just have to work the (xx) okay i have a question, i don't have my workbook with me but it was one of the homework problems from the demand section, it was where (xx) no wai- wai- substitution effects. okay  okay so supposing (you have) this old Ambrose utility function. okay mhm mhm oh it's, one over, okay (xx) will be, four over, radical-X? yeah except it's one-half times four so it's two. two oh you're right okay. and then the M-E-two is, one okay mhm mhm okay okay  correct the problem is when his income falls so low that he can't buy, sixteen. so he doesn't buy any X-two. then he buys only X-one. and it moves along here. okay sixteen   has sixteen  okay it's so easy when you explain it. that's the problem with this course i mean   um, Matt okay. so what we're talking about is you're consuming something the price changes and, what um, (sorry can i,) and what, happens. um first of all the consumer, should be compensated, in some way for that price, change. how do we compensate them? the idea is we should compensate them to leave real income, constant. or purchasing power constant. so then there's a difference in definition. Slutsky says, give them cash to give them back, their original, choice. Hicks says give 'em cash to give them back their original, utility. so, if we were drawing, something, so this is good one good two, uh here's a budget line, want good one to get cheaper? yeah along the indifference curve  but what if the price goes down, or the price goes up for, good one then, Slutsky's, taking away more money? so price_ this is what i did here so price went up for good one, okay the the okay  that's what i did here. oh that is up okay  (it's) steeper. yeah got steeper. it but Hicks would, only allow you, to get your original utility back so you'd be getting less cash. okay  okay alright. um what (xx) mm oh yeah you were gonna tell us what's on the quiz today. right right right it could be anything from chapter, okay, thanks, you've cleared that up are there gonna be any review sessions? for    the exam is Tuesday. Tuesday whatever she said Monday   three fifteen so you can come  which accounting? oh two-seventy-one. that's the the the tough one. that's the  oh please don't say that. it was okay but,  yeah it was  oh  what? they say yo- you either like calculus or you like accounting you can't like them both.  i had an accounting class that i thought was a lot of fun and i liked math, but it wasn't here. oh that would do it    yeah oh okay. so wait two-seventy-one is meant for people that are it's a it's a pre-req for the B-School.   is there any way you could like go over Edward's boxes (xx) Edward's boxes what about them? i don't know i've just, (xx)  oh okay wait so,  um, these questions o- one through, five plus the other four in the workbook. are for two days. okay but what's due tomorrow? what's due tomorrow. i'll announce it when i go in there. question one. in this, assignment. okay one A and B, two and six? yeah correct. yep... (okay) (actually) emailed me oh okay, i we just decided what this was gonna be. i had to look at it. um but, the Edw- so what about the (Edward's?) i don't know i don't even (xx) the question. the first problem i was already, like, getting lost on it (xx) so the big thing about the Edward box is, hi come on in (xx) hi  okay i'll share. we can take the box off that one if you want to, work  okay so we got this box. and what it's representing is the total amount of good one in the economy. going this way. and the total amount of good two in the economy going, up. and what we're gonna do with it is we're gonna say we have two people both with endowments. so we'll put them at some, point here. uhuh okay but so how do you represent different marginal rates of  okay what if they both, what if there're two people that have different ones then? okay. then the other person_ this is how i do this. turn your paper upside down. okay right sure mm  okay is there like some inequality that you could write out that would show how they would trade? i don't know it's so_ like the first question to know exactly where'd they go? you'd need to have utility functions. the first question is just a really vague, um, draw a picture where, what direction would they go? oh and would it be true for (better) okay it does- it doesn't have you say it. you can't answer numerically  okay Tuesday um, yeah i have qu- one question okay what page? it's on this uh to find if X-one was inferior   mhm   so, if it was a price decrease this was a price increase right? correct  so if you want to look at, what happens with income exactly, mhm okay mhm   okay. but then here it was saying something like, when good one, i, i thought that this was going with this graph but i guess not. so that one the good got more expensive you consume less that's the  good.    okay okay okay so what happens? price goes, up. mhm mhm okay okay okay mhm mkay  oh okay mhm mhm   so that would be a given good. yes a given good must be inferior. okay, right  if the, i- income effect ends up smaller in size than the substitution effect. the opposite direction (xx) yeah still the opposite direction, but point C would be increasing. someone else told me this trick where you know if you draw, the line straight down over here, if, like this part of the graph it's like, between here and here it's normal between, through here it's inferior so if you draw a line through A, and compare A to C, okay right okay normal   okay okay  right okay okay so on this side you've got normal and ordinary.  ordinary doesn't have to be normal   mhm oh okay mhm right (it's given) here it's just, just normal. and here it's, normal and,  that's a good drawing (xx) (xx) yeah hm normal or, ordinary. yeah yeah (yeah okay.) cuz one is describing the income and the other is describing the, price... (xx)  (just) really quick question is this a example of homothetic preferences? yes. but i thought, it could only be homothetic if it was g- a ray going  exactly. and what we have here is is a ray going straight through the origin but the problem is there's a second constraint.   someone can pick up the stuff out of here too so i can get to class and hand out Scantrons. okay thank you and hopefully there's more than one person that, 	1
LAB500SU044.json	they're gonna be posted on the Internet but like not until Monday, or something like that really?      two Thursdays from now. and the review will be this coming Wednesday. and, i i took a lot of your criticism about the last review to heart and, i'm running it. so don't worry about it, okay? it'll be okay. uh me me and Angie are running it. wait is Wednesday the only review? Wednesday is the only review session, but it's it's in class. wh- can you not make class? or what? oh in class. it's in class just like last time, yeah. oh, right instead of saying, we can't answer that. um, okay, so, shit no way we need tweezers? tweezers are cool, for pulling away some of the smaller parts, and everyone's in- every group should try to have some. huh? now you go out and sell (underwear) again (xx) um yeah i know okay... follow the, basically follow the dissection process step by step. i wanna reiterate, this is a, teaching technique, this is a pedagogical method for you guys, to learn, where, the parts of brain are. i don't care what your brain looks like at the end of this. hey tell me about the pineal gland. wh- what exactly does the pineal gland what does  i just noticed it it's right, it's in the hindbrain, yeah it's it's really hard to find but it didn't say anything about it in the book the pineal gland is it's really only interesting if you're into, uh, uh  uh it's a it's a it's a theory that that consciousness  yeah well because Descartes thought that consciousness can't (do anything) well yeah that's what i mean yeah  i think so   possibly. possibly. is anybody else going out of town for the weekend? alright. (i wanna leave town for the weekend.) man i remember (seeing where you guys) (xx) you know. (xx) (specific) one of these little curves? no. this whole area? it's well like uh like front- frontal lobe i  cuz then we can point to like a specific, thing you know? like temporal is temporal is uh right here right right somewhere up here that's the cerebellum yeah, and then (parielesum,) up here? right and parietal up on top honestly, yeah, i don't remember her showing us, i think she said it was really sketchy you know sort of between where exactly between like uh, you know parietal ends and the frontal starts. so... alright. trying to find the central sulcus  uh, it's possible whoa it's freaky, (i thought there) was only one optic nerve that comes into the brain (maybe these things start here)  uh this is the medulla? medulla and then coming up with this here the spinal cord. right i guess, this would would be the pons, somewhere here? right right right there yep. pre and postcentral, gyri? i don't even see where that is. this this alright nah, know where you know where the central we should (be able to see) it a lot better if we cut it open?   it look li- it looks like a (xx) (and uh) i thought that was a internal too like around a ling- like here's a, a gyri postcentral gyrus there,  alright, um... olfactory and optic nerves. olfactory looks like this is removed where it says removed i don't know if that's a diagram of what we were supposed to be looking at. hey Dan. yeah. o- is the olfactory bulb in this or not?   doubtful? yeah cuz it says removed on this diagram yeah, it's it's usually yanked off, yeah? alright as in, olfactory? and what's the other one on_ the matching one on the other side?  oh really? yeah, right yeah yeah right i have a question, when, when you're looking for the occipital lobes. uhuh   yeah, i mean it's hard to find. like, the central sulcus is supposed to be right about, here. actually you can see   right okay and temporal temporal parietal that difference is there something  yeah right right right. now now where's the optic nerve on there? and you guys it's really hard to find on this, but it would be here. that far back? well it kind of goes, it it shou- this is part of it right there. this is this is actually a sheep brain right? that's actually a sheep brain. and so this is a really good way to tell you where it would be. i don't even i don't even see. i see op- optic, chiasm optic tract, yeah, the optic tract is here. and what would happen is you- you would see a crossover. some of the crossovers are more clear than others. but that's like, this is the superior colliculus and so it's going right into the superior colliculus from there. this one's not. this one's been beaten up. we- we'll try to_ if you if you guys can't find certain organs, wander around a little bit and see if you can find them. alright (xx) pons and medulla (xx) uh, this would be, (xx) see it looks like the (pondula) pulled it out yeah well i think that little thing that we tore down (xx) okay right right right  hypoth- hypothalamus and this is, somewhere we gotta open this we gotta open it up and and see no yeah look at it. that's what it s- that's what it says. turn the brain over again. alright it says, i- uh it, try to find the uh, cranial nerves.  the, cingulate, uh, gyrus? where is that? i don't know. oh that's well if it's cingulate (xx) the cranial, (xx)  yeah leakage uh, (you mean) right there? the white part? it's it's a great (xx) internal (xx) (structure) from the rest of the, right connected (to) the hemisphere yeah, corpus callosum (xx) talking about that (xx) okay, yeah okay so you should be be, alright so you're  now see if you get a different (xx) it's uh    hm' i i i didn't realize it, like when i was m- meeting up there with uh, that three-seventy-whatever, two session. that everybody meets at the same time like right down the hall from each other. i saw, another girl (xx) what here in uh Dennison two-seventy-two um no Peterson, the, research class yeah yeah  you're in that also? yeah that's crazy. we're all abnormal. yeah, i know you kept saying that maybe i took, yeah. the thing um, there was this girl, who's in another one. (xx) she's in my Cognitive Psych class. now she has three psych classes now? yeah, and i got like stats too right now  yeah it's a lot of work (xx) (xx) (but,) it's, not so hard, so far but i'm but i'm kind of kind of lo- losing my energy because it's getting sort of like repetitive yeah  come on (xx) yeah mhm    which one? (xx) the (xx) (xx) i don't know what that is. i guess i guess, you wanna, cut the brains in halves. anyone, wanna?  uh it, sounds like you're (xx)  (xx) guess it's take off. (xx) just take this off? (xx) yeah, cerebellum and all that or we could chop it like this. no no no don't do that. see, does it rip right out? well anyway  pretty nasty, oh that's cool. alright, cool. (xx) that's yeah it that's a regular one... funky. which one's that? that's a  alright okay now find the corpus callosum. that would be (xx) type looking (xx) boy it really is defined where's the fornix exactly? what the (xx) fornix? that's in a surrounded structure or something isn't it? surrounding (in) a, uh, (i really don't know) what does it uh, (xx)  well this would be the, thalamus the thalamus is right all the way in the middle. yeah  whew. God that stuff stinks when it gets close to it. (xx) don't ask me. (xx) squeeze the crap out of it. there it is the fornix. a- a- all i see is  oh it's i guess it's kinda down  i guess it (xx) okay there's the pin okay so that thing right there on th- on the top end riding piggyback is the pineal pineal gland where is that?   oh it's not (xx) this one is it? i think that oh okay   the pi- the pineal body what's that, where's that on the uh no it's not i don't think it's oh okay he said it, he said there was no, apparent structure or i mean no, something it's a gland so it must, release some hormone or something. tha- that's what i think it's about (xx) (xx) pineal gland. now he's hurt. i don't know what exactly it does. (where's the) (xx) oh that's how they disattach. because remember the (xx) hangs that it hangs that it's really delicate and probably falls off or, or gets um, taken. alright what else you guys? the cingulate gyrus. oh that's, i, i can't tell (a gigantic) i think it's just the first layer do you have like a little piece of gray like right on top of your thalamus? not really no why.   you think that's the fornix? yeah that's what i think too. cuz it, just looks li- i forget what it does but it look like, (xx) uh you know (xx) or something. cingulate gyrus is right there? alright, hypothalamus? hypothalamus is supposed to be underneath the uh (xx) alright, guys. some of you are are taking the phrase gently separate a little too far, and pulling it to the point where i've already seen two groups rip their corpus callosum, alright? oh   yeah this would be the thalamus. this is definitely the thalamus. the the gyrus? what do we do? i mean this doesn't look like anything (xx) I wonder what this (xx) is right here? look at this, little guy. it's like a little, like separate structure right here.  i don't have any clue but that's a superior (colliculus,) it's right uh, (right there,) yeah, that's a, that's a little like, it's like a totally separate color. it's a different color, it's a different structure. is that the superior colliculus?  that's a mid- that's a midbrain  nah it's not (xx) it's the superior colliculus yeah. oh look here's (another) see this is screwing me up cuz i'm looking at the other side of the brain yeah (xx) nah, not exactly no. actually i got the hole here ( now i actually got) (xx) i don't know, do we have it there? you got, you got some stringy stuff coming off, comes off of the uh pons (and the) medulla hey Kevin. hey what? is this pineal gland here? that's uh,  you got it? yeah. lemme see it. let's see. we're assuming.   yep that's it one of the best ways  yeah you got- you gotta really gotta get in there. after you, do each analysis, mhm i got, i got a nerve coming out   the hypothalamus? yeah. well the thalamus is, this thing right here okay like on on this half it'd be uh, lemme (i guess let's see)  (the) hypothalamus must be that  what do you what do you what do you guys think (well) maybe this is a hypothalamus, it's like a separate sort of structure,    so the optic tract is, there's an optic nerve, where? you mean, this is the optic, this is the optic nerve. optic, optic tract is   last question. yeah this area here? uh yeah (xx) okay so this is gonna be, when you pull this over, that's your superior colliculus. it's just you can't see it very well cuz it's hidden by cortex. oh, okay so that's what you were saying. yeah, so, after you guys do some (xx) one thing you can do is you can actually do a a horizontal slice this way and sort of see wha- actually no one's ever done that. (xx) do the horizontal slice this way. and you can we uh (xx) the cortex? yeah, because what's happening is that the cortex is hiding, (xx) (some) meninges. the cortex is hiding all this cool stuff. right now would this lemme a- lemme get two more questions here, we got a gra- some gray material right there. that's meninges. that's uh just um just (xx) matter and it's that far inside the  th- a fold? (this is_) what'd you, what'd you say? the fold? not the folds the um, (God) what the_ ventricles. these are the ventricles, mhm any s- any s_ (xx) yeah those are those big_ space there? that's our, that's our ventricle. and there's a big old mama ventricle underneath. (here) y- yeah exactly, and you see this white really_ this is a really tough white fiber here? yeah and so, the pineal gland, is there any uh, um, a hormone that it secretes?   yeah i can't just remember though off the top of my head. i'll probably remember about, in another two weeks. um, where'd he say the ventricles were? um (lemme see) like. (in that hole) like spaces? yeah, an- anything any any of the separating areas have the ventricle because that's gonna be fluid (xx) right you know (you see these) layers optic, chiasm. you see, where we were pointing at? no i got a big old mother nerve right there. that's the (xx) brain? yeah it comes underneath. (xx) down (over here?) is that underneath here? (xx) oh yeah you do. this point right here, (xx) mammillary bodies? i think they're mammillary bodies but i was pointing at i thought that mighta been the hypothalamus but that's that  he said cut it through the uh, through the  i wanna get through the (xx) the midbrain after that?   yeah, it's like, gritty man. the dorsal surface is like, (one or two from) here. (xx) (that's not what he was saying about this) it's way,  yeah (xx) pons. okay so, how do we know what the pons is? (how do we know what to do with this?) maybe that's the mammillary body. what what'd he say (xx) (xx) (over here) uh, hippo- how do you get the hippocampus? right, it's this (we're) trying to get in here to the visible (xx) what's this in here? (xx) oh that's the (xx) (y'all) want the half the brain to work with now? see this in here? this (xx) yeah that's what i was looking at too. yeah. i don't know. it it's a knobby little it's a knobby little structure. it doesn't show (anything.) wow, like a little uh, section in there. (well) that'd be amygdala. you got the nerve, (xx) a separate sulcus i'm just gonna slice it out. yeah, there's like all this bullshit in the way. we don't have an amygdala on our (tract...) alright so that's a good slice. i don't (if) (xx) this looks like nothing to me all the (definitions along there?) still don't  yeah (xx) oh well, (is that a) that's a   (what does a) (xx) (do?) what is all this stuff? i don't know, i think that's the, we just got outside the limbic system. so a lotta that st- it's like all that stuff is on the outside of the brain. you know? inside_ the inside it's it's really gray it's (xx) whoa. this broke right off. i think that's the top of the cere- this thing? seems like the smaller you get smaller and smaller little curves see how it, yeah  it's like a little snail. so that's, (xx) this is the nerve this is the optic nerve i-i-i- it might be  yeah (xx) (xx) (xx) organs (xx) ( no i didn't i needed a lot on demand.) all those little curves yeah what is that stuff? (xx) (xx) like let's see (xx) i like the red (piculars.) whew whew (xx) take a break hold on a sec (xx) back together again     yo... i don't know what, i can't tell y- see a little bit of  mhm yeah mhm? oh uh, alright, so, we got one half of this this this toast   don't look at me  okay (xx)   alright, look looked uh mild  and uh, isn't this the corpus?  the cerebellum. right. now imagine like with humans, it would look like this, right? which is why we w- w- confused wi- with, animals, yeah it's like straight back so this is superior inferior colliculi. now, what you're supposed to be able to do if you cut right through the middle of this, is find the substantia nigra but i i haven't found (anybody can) do it. um okay red stuff?  (xx) little veins yeah (xx)   yeah okay, this is the fornix. alright? wait where is- isn't the fornix right on the,  it's on the ventral side of the corpu- it's on the ventral side of the corpus callosum and what you need here is that, okay is this the corpus callosum here? uh, no this is,  he just kinda took a cross-section and i just tried to pick it apart,  i don't remember to be honest  okay you see this little lump here? if if i understand correctly if i remember correctly this would actually go, into the temporal lobe cuz this looks like, a temporal lobe (project-) so when you cut this one open be a little more careful. try to separate, try to cut off the top of the cortex. (this is) the other half this the other half of it? there's a lot. (xx) yeah. okay  what's on your_ what's in your right f- between your right thumb and finger right here? right here? no right up there no, that's no- no the the, pull it back, mhm right there? i don't i don't know. i don't know what that is. this is um, this part right here is interesting because there, is the fornix. you see that? you see this, right here? this is the fornix and if you pull this away, peel it? ooh look at that the, stringy uh? yeah, it it's really interesting isn't it? and and underneath that, on this side, should be, (xx) mkay so those things are actually, you can't see 'em unless you dig  so i should make should make like i should make a cut on top of the cors- yeah cut on top and try to and try to get at it in two ways. but remember that what's gonna happen is that those bodies will separate  what is this, uh guy filming here doing? (xx) (it's about) language (or something) oh really? something about second languages (or something) weird. did (you guys) get (xx) (for this?) (i used) (xx) oh man come on (xx) (brain parts in my book) (xx) (yeah) you can get a real thin slice and use it as a bookmarker if you freeze-dry it. (and then the) girl stops and (flick) open my book (in the library) (xx) i'm not finding anything (xx) (xx) what's behind it? what are you looking at? is there something behind there? (xx) didn't he say you peel that lexical layering away (and) the hippocampus is behind there? um (no,) it's stronger like the more you cut into it it's gotten really so (xx) in there (xx) yeah i know. (xx) (you know how it goes) back together you just take really small slices in the, i wanna get  that was really weird see it was on TV like they took a um, forget like a a like an (xx) like a, like a serial killer, like (xx) oh when they sliced him into like  and sews him up. and no one (finds out) about it wow yeah you ca- i think you can buy that program for like on_ for your computer. the Digital Man. like it's like sixty bucks or seventy bucks and you can go to the_ the site is weird yeah they free- they freeze the pieces (xx) they slide  did they? yeah cuz they didn't have a woman, who was like scummy enough to wanna do that to i guess aw this is cool you can, peel off this uh, this sheet thing oh the  you're just going to town on the (xx) ooh there's nothing left of (xx) whew (i guess i'll watch right after) (xx) (xx) that's a solid, that's a solid, slice what is that thing? i dunno i thought that's the cingulate gyrus? or the um, yeah i think it's the cingulate gyrus. look. it's that it's that curly (curly thing.) (xx) oh yeah. do do mkay (are these, are these just like) (xx) there's (veal.) look at the size of it. (wow) that must be an artery. (the other side of that, look at the side of this) huge unless it was already (de-juiced) (yeah we already did that) we gotta keep going through them?  it says peel them gently away to expose the hippocampus so i'm just coming at the hippocampus from the other side. from what you were coming at it from. (i don't know about) gentle... it look- tastes like chicken every time it seems to (go, just go) right part, (xx) (save that shit) we need some, we need some better tools. (xx) so where's the hippo- where's the hippocampus supposed to be? (xx) (xx) should be like in in there then? yeah it should be, right. right in this right in th- well look. looks like it, sh- should be right in here. right on the bottom (xx) right on the bottom (here,) of this, mm so here's my thalamus, when i'm coming from the other side. and then there's, some big meaty-ass structure. now wait a minute here, the hippocampus should be right up (over) here. (xx) i know it's not that little, dark, thing on the bottom (though.) oh, (you) got something there (xx) do you think that amygdala (you think) (xx) or did he tell us  (xx) i i wonder i i i found (xx) you might wanna pull this completely apart cuz we'll be able to identify it better i think i toasted (my) (i can't get any further) cuz it seems like nowhere (xx) (from a different) way well you're almost to (the other side) i'm not getting to the (cavity.)  sorry dude.  isn't it amazing that he can like (pick) up all the little pieces and be like oh that's the (da-da-da) (xx) i dunno. hafta find something (in there going go) above this cortex (xx) some of those shapes? yeah it's really (xx)  so you like, pass, pass this little thing that's broken apart real nice yeah you gotta nice sec- you gotta nice section there. it's just like, (it's really fine) all i got all i have left is the midbrain, and the uh, a little bit of the internal structure like my, cortex is, toast. my cerebellum's toast. (too much shit to work with) i'm telling you (xx) (let's get it) (xx) (there it is) where? oh, yeah. oh yeah. (xx) did you get the outside (there?) (xx) you got the outside (of each) (though right?) (xx) yeah. (this is) kinda dark, (i wonder) what's going on oh yeah. that's general slime. (xx) (i'm gonna flip it over) (xx) (it says he) said the (xx) hypothalamus would be, somewhere in here cool gimme that (there's not) enough (of that) gimme that (xx) before we go? (xx) part of this (xx) wow that's really (different) i wonder if, (xx) you sure it's not (part of) (xx) yeah hold on i wonder what's uh, wasn't that something in three-seventy-three we should (be able to list the) (xx)  (xx) (last night) you didn't? i can't believe that i     are you coming to se- are you coming to look? yeah. we have like (four) we have like half, now.   alright. well what did you do with the, the brain stem? i mean, did you find anything? we found a  the brains, well there you go, well no no no wait a minute i think, are you messing with my cerebellum, now? (this is) the cerebellum yeah yeah  (that's) the cerebellum the spinal cord? no no spinal cord's down here. and that's the medulla okay so that's the medulla, right there. and then uh  what's going on? (that's it right there) yeah, so that right there (is the pons, it's that thing) (xx) and that's the, the, hindbrain section, the medulla with uh, um, with the midbrain. which is this stuff right in here. so, that's like the superior colliculus in here somewhere, which we found and then destroyed somehow  i knew that was gonna happen (xx) around on the floor what is that a bottle (xx) or something? um... yeah we found it eventually, like we had to (mess with) (xx) this corpus thing. yeah, yeah (all this) corpus callosum, all that. i haven't done any reading yet, so like... i'm gonna cram the last week (xx) (man,) i'm getting like dizzy and like, lightheaded. i mean (xx) with no food (in like) (what is it now?) doesn't this look like chicken? or isn't there chicken (xx) it feels like a chicken.  no chicken no sushi... oh yeah, (the little) sacks in between 'em there. (who's the) (xx) what do we got for the time? how much longer w- should we really be expected to stay here? whenever. we can leave whenever? yeah. like i'm, i'm getting ready, right now, right? thank you how are y'all doing?   we uh, we can't find the hippocampus (still) but, (i think) we we got everything else i'm gonna help you guys try to find the hippocampus here (xx) watch out for, yo lea- don't get brains on the tables okay? alright, so, so we had that, and then this guy, comes out, yeah,   okay, yeah this is important hold on here. alright, um, if you're finishing up, there's a, container right over here that says, well let's see (see if i can find one.) discard parts. it says parts discard, okay? only, only throw brain tissue in there don't throw gloves or snot or, tampons or any of that other stuff, just brains okay? (brains go in there?)  okay?   (we have to) wash our plates off? what? excuse me? where do we (xx) uh, give 'em to me and_ (well actually.) these go in the discard parts right here. mkay? yeah. clean up, clean up your mess in these trays up front. it's only six-thirty (xx) let's see if we can (go) mhm, i'm about ready. (let's go) it's gonna be fucking hard, (xx) yeah... (xx) these i need i need (xx) (one, question) yeah, (xx)  that's a lotta shit.  it'll be easier (than that stuff) (right.) it'll be clearly marked, yeah. (xx) trying to find the part. okay. now let m- let me take a look here and see what you got (here) yeah (xx) you guys are really (cooking.) (xx) these are some intense questions man, these are some really, intense questions. they're okay,  well, the materi- a lot of this you don't know yet, right? but, we're gonna talk about this next_ but but think about it this way, i think these are a lot more conceptually straightforward  no i agree yeah yeah yeah so yeah yeah there's only one (xx) right.   yeah, you, your brain is so tough, it's really hard.  yeah i just wanna look at your i   it's like it's like it's like (it formed into one) with all the uh yeah, yeah. it really is. it's kinda get, a little bit on the bottom of that. mhm alright, what was the thing that you never found? um, i never found the amygdala. the amygdala is nestled so deep inside there that in order to get to it you usually have to destroy it. it's it's it's underneath, all this cortex, right? we don't have (amygdala.) what did, what did you say with the gloves? uh, put the gloves in the plastic garbage bag. actually it's due on Monday, alright, yeah. when is your critique due? Monday. Monday. Thursday. Monday? Monday i thought it was Thursday.  i thought it was Thursday. the the outline was due on Thursday. wait wait wait how we gonna get 'em to you? give 'em to me in class, y'all are planning to 	1
STP450SG128.json	do you know wha- what the name of this effect, that having somebody, taping, and then, watching us? Hawthorn Effect yes. what? Hawthorn the Hawthorn Effect. mhm    yeah maybe it was a, lightbulb plant or something like that. okay, so um, so i'm sorry i i ha- i my voice uh doesn't sound uh, uh as good as, it should be but um, yeah the last week i had a crew from Japan who, uh videotape, various part of the, on- and off-campus, um, about the child care resource in Ann Arbor, this is something, i report, i made a report last year. um, based on a request, from the uh government um a section of the government in Japan and, the child care issue i mean i went through as a a parent but, it's not my expertise and i try to resign, but i couldn't so at the end i did and i thought that was it and said RESTRICTED and right? and the first one is is Melissa? do you oh Becky  okay. wait a minute did we agree, twenty minutes? mhm yes  i can do it, i was gonna (xx,) um,  i can do it   and then what you need to do is um... twenty minutes so, like uh three minutes, to twenty minutes seventeen minutes you have to give her a sign so  five yeah five minutes is a little bit too long um, three minutes left  can anyone can donates some paper for me? sure uhuh. Dr Yung, d- do you want our papers now because i've got like stacks you can do, either yes. at the end or you can give it to me anyone else want to hand 'em in? so you can sleep tonight... so then i have to get it to over to uh, slide show  right here? yup. RESTRICTED it's cool. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED is that two thousand? that you got that cool RESTRICTED RESTRICTED (xx) two thousand has all of the RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED that will be, much easier RESTRICTED now Melissa you didn't include any of the um, financial aspect of the autonomy in this uh picture is there a reason is there any reason RESTRICTED well i think the financial aspect has a great impact it of the part of the uh, it may goes under environment you know the the uh (xx) uh, believe that, how the environment set up in terms of financial, incentive and, uh reward, to be, um, autonomous. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED so what kind of question did you ask before? then you can repeat that... RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i have a i have a question about that, N-A-S scale, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED okay so it it depends on the weighting of that individual item? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED Melissa i kind of liked your uh, i i actually like that last tool, i mean it sounded kind of interesting, um, your comment about well, then what, if we find RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it's it's also interesting that community, nurses, who have a high level of autonomy, are also a fairly stable population of nurses. people who go who tend to go into that stay in it, until they they retire. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED right. RESTRICTED mhm yeah so Me- Melissa are you still working on a definition at the at the definition of a s- RESTRICTED right right to identify core RESTRICTED RESTRICTED all right well thank you RESTRICTED Julie and Jermporn our computer experts. i don't have to do anything else or actually this one RESTRICTED i hate these (xx) who's the next person here? Julie are you the next person? oh i guess i, (xx) mine (xx) do over again oh it's just because it never was closed. i wanna put mine in down here... oh can you toss one back this way? RESTRICTED oh Sirirat, oh never mind. Chow already left. yeah Chow's already home. RESTRICTED now this computer can be annoying. i would love to go back... we were all over. we were in Bangkok (xx) i actually was in Chiangmai. i can never remember the name of this town it's a little town across from the (xx) it's way up in the north. Laos. but we were on the Thai side and there's a refugee camp (xx) okay mine's saying it can't read my disk. uh'oh   i'm sorry? what version of this    RESTRICTED this computer (xx) yeah this computer's a little, been a little, little flaky what about, Julie, uh somebody else... well the computer's been acting a little goofy so... it's confused because you closed the thing and her disk wasn't in there RESTRICTED it's saying that you had to put her disk back in cuz it's saying that it can't find RESTRICTED uh your disk actually is the one that was, not closed. your your presentation is the one that wasn't closed.  yeah. it's right there. it's under there (xx) no. i'm just making sure it works because i was panicked that it wouldn't. i don't think this is, what's gonna happen Becky you mess up my disk and you be dead girl oh now nice RESTRICTED that's professional academic uh, RESTRICTED and what did i say about name calling? well i mean if this doesn't work i can still just give this um, presentation based on the   well, this this um, what do you call it? it  yeah  we can, you, we can put your presentation at the end but by that time somebody may figure out some kind of problem. well do you want to go ahead without the pre- Power pres- PowerPoint? well either way we need to, this computer's not acting all the,  reboot yeah. mhm take out my disk when you do it (xx) it's gonna chew it all up reformat it you'll get this grinding sound well would you like me to uh just give my presentation without the PowerPoint or   it's not just your disk the whole   yeah it's RealPlayer it's not, anything to do with the disk. uh anybody has a serious problem if we if we run uh beyond uh twelve o'clock today? i have to go put more money in the meter that's all RESTRICTED okay, well, then, that is the case maybe, Julie you can present next week, and then we can finish five, today. and then maybe you can_ if you're uh  let's wait for, somebody who knows about computer i know nothing   okay, somebody who, who is liked by computer. this isn't Dogbert. huh? this isn't Dogbert. the one that has a certain, reputation yeah Dogbert the uh. is this Dogbert? RESTRICTED i may, um, you know what i think i'm gonna go, find a (xx) team, who may (xx,) um, so if you need to go bathroom go bathroom right now and then you won't get another chance hi good morning everybody today i like to presents two concept, it's about the nutritional adaptation and cognitive representation of lifestyle modification. um, the reason that i went interested in these two concept because is uh, involved with hypertension. hypertension is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease, and stroke not only in the United State but also elsewhere in the world. my main area of interest uh, is the similarity and differences in cognitive representation of dietary behavior, as experience by (xx) or patient who have a normal blood pressure. and hypertensive adult female who are being treated with anti-hypertensive medication. cognitive representation of dietary behavior are enduring memory, or socially and culturally derived, lifestyle practices. despite the development of social cognition as (xx) of (xx) theory, for expanding dietary behavior and medical nutritional therapy little is known about, interaction, um, between cognition culture, and, uh on the uh cult- cognition and culture, uh on a cult- or intended that actually practices, after clinical diagnose of essential hypertension. two fascinating concept that i, am gonna explore for my future dissertation in nutritional adaptation and cognitive representation of lifestyle modifications. uh for nutritional uh adaptation, the theoretical definition is a state in which people consciously realize and remembers the usefulness of selectional choices, and plan to follow dietary instruction in order to (reorient) their health behavior. in this particular case the concept will be focused on the selection of nutritious food choices. to lower, blood pressure in hypertensive patient. (xx.) for operationalized definition, is an (education) of information processes of adaptive base for one's eating pattern after (being) guidance or counseling. nutritional adaptation can be measured by answering sixteen item, of the, questionnaire of the instrument development cognitive representation, of dietary behaviors scale developed by doctor Margaret Scisney-Matlock and you can also see in the, appendix A that i gave you in the handout. um how i'm how am i gonna measure? i'm looking for the mean total score of the sixteen item, and also all items will use a five-point Likert scale scoring, zero is not at all one is a little two is somewhat three is quite a bit four is very much. and two-point-five is (done) now you might, you might ask me this is a five-point Likert scale why uh where's two-point-five come from? actually, uh before this instru- uh, in the previous instrument, uh, my advisor she doesn't includes two-point-five in the, in the, in the scale, and then, in when she develop uh, rewires uh her instrument and she, add two-point-five because some people ask her about, uh, they have a difficult time to, to rate, the scale. and i'm gonna use uh all of these items some (in responsive) on these sixteen items selected. all items selected are positive statement. and, i'll give you an example one example of the selected item is is four to five serving of fruit per day. the subject answering very much is given a score of four, conversely the subject answering not at all is given a score of zero. for the definition of cognitive representation of lifestyle modification, theoretical definition, is a state in which people integrate their information processes for one's own lifestyle to enhance their well-being. or a (xx) that (xx) behavior in this particular case the concept will be emphasize on assessing heath behavior lifestyle in order to (ameliorate their) blood pressure... the operational definition for this concept is defined as a integration of people information processes, of one's own lifestyle in adaptive ways, in order to improve their health behaviors. cognitive representations of lifestyle modification, are measured by answering fourteen selected item of the lifestyle. hypertension cognitive represen- representation scale at the (xx) of my, doctor. Margaret Scisney-Matlock, i think it's uh in, she's developed in nineteen ninety-three and still revise it, uh in nineteen ninety-eight... i'm gonna measure by us- uh looking for the means total score of the fourteen item, and subject indicate that (he'll) behavior lifestyle please look at the appendix B, the item will use a five-point Likert scale again, some in responses for this uh fourteen-item together. and all items selected are positive statement. and the example of this kind of uh s- selected item is (xx,) the subject, answering very much is given a score of four, and a subject answering not at all is given a score of zero. come to uh, the use of the nine criter- uh nine criteria in in evaluating, adequacy of the operationalization of the concept. (xx) of clarity, precision, uh, reliability, consistency. meaning adequacy, feasibility, utility, validity, and consensus. please uh looking for the last page of the handout i gave you, um, because uh these two concept they're uh even though they're uh they (enforce) a different kind of measurement they have um, uh, some theme, the same theme but, some criteria, is pretty different so i'm gonna talk uh together. the criteria in terms of the cla- clarity, the nutritional adaptation, in terms of clarity definition, indicator and, operation will be focus on because uh nutritional adaptation is a new concept it's really difficult to fi- uh looking uh compare, any kind of definition, and i also talked to my advisor and she told me that i have to define it by myself. so, i tried to de_ you know if i put a cognitive representation of an additional adaptation you guys gonna ask me what Sirirat what are you talking about? because cognitive representation, sometime (field) is very abstract, and sometime it's very concrete so it's very difficult, so that's why i don't us- i, try not to puts the cognitive representation, uh, for my concept i just use nutritional adaptation. so for the lay_ it's good in terms of for the lay population to understand. and also for the cognitive repre- representation of lifestyle modification, i thinks, this concept is really difficult to understand for the lay population but i still like to (xx) cognitive representation, because this is my uh area of interest there. and i might use an uh an alternative option, i might use lifestyle modification for hypertension, and it's, i think it's gonna be me- much be, much more comfortable to talk to general population. in terms of precision, this uh, between the two of the, the C-R-E-B of uh, cognitive representation the actual behavior too, and L-S-C-R is uh lifestyle hypertension cognitive representation. uh these two these (xx,) this these (xx) can be observed measure and operationalize. in term of reliability... nutritional adaptation has an accep- acceptable reliability allowed quite (xx) and for cognitive repre- uh for L-S-C-R, has a test and retest reliability, from point-five-three to point-six, and internal consistency point-seven-nine. in term of consistency i thinks these two uh, uh these two uh instillment, use the same thing is uh frequency of distribution of letter responsive in selecting food, or performing their own lifestyle. in terms of positive statement. i think positive statement is convenient for me, to uh for calculation, in the data because if i also include negative uh statement it doesn't mean that i cannot do that but i just thinking that i need to record uh, the score first if i gonna include other items into, to measure, this concept. and in terms of meaning adequacy, i'm a kind of wonderings about terminology if you're looking for in uh at appendix A and B, appendix A talks about mhm oh i (like the cartoons) oh i (xx.) do you have any question or, any comments? RESTRICTED i don't know. RESTRICTED   i just have a theoretical question for you uhuh okay mhm mm  the equation is like this uh, like the people why they cannot st- uh quit smoking. mhm mhm it's putting yourself     (xx) um, i have a question um probably this group know better than i do but, could you explain to me what cognitive representation means with uh, plain English? uh cognitive representation is a collection, a feature, of the objects, in the brain, and sometime they might haves a network, they for example, can i just use the board? because it's a kind of pretty abstract for me well you can just, probably everybody in this class knows    so how does it connect to uh, actual uh lifestyle, practice? because cognitive representation and dietary behavior are enduring memories, of the socially and culturally derived, lifestyle practices. they might just get stuck, feeling lost.  so that's what you asked uh uh uh um Rebecca? uh the theory? yeah just that  mhm  right. yeah well in it i- well not in it is a point i think uh you tried to, uh, you know uh, uh, intervene or, we can say manipulate, whether you have that in your cog- you can recognize it or even enhanced by repeated memory doesn't necessarily um dictate your behavior. so you know how does it come in to, well i guess it's it's, it may not be uh to me it seems like um, we have cognitive representation but we have a cluster, mhm mhm yeah  yeah which one's more relevant self-relevant so that might be yeah (xx) to be equal to  yup. it's gonna override that healthy uh,   you try to make that stronger   but that might be a whole research project  right. okay, are we, i think we have to move on to the next right? well thank you good job great visuals. fascinating. okay. great. how do i get this thing out of this view? do you wanna do slide show? (xx) oh there it is i just couldn't see it on there  (at arms) okay Nancy could you? yeah um for those of you that um, have been with me all along most of you, you will see a little bit of a change in this presentation, um i have always been interested in cognition and the environment. so what i've done is sort of narrowed things down and broadened other things, and i'm looking at a little bit different aspect than i was last year. um the two concepts that i've chosen to look at are spatial mapping and life-space mobility, um, spatial mapping, uh we think of th- of that um, in terms of the hippocampus i'm gonna go a little bit into theory just a tiny bit to set the stage here, um basically what spatial mapping is is the ability to map space to make a cognitive representation and using Sirirat's words of a space. um what the theory behind this says is that uh we have place cells in our hippocampus that actually fire, when we get into a certain space. and that when we're mapping a new space, those place cells create a map of that space so the next time we come, those same place cells fire, and we know where we are. the important things to take away from um, the the literature on spatial mapping is, that it's very flexible and this allows us to function in the world we live in, and th- the example i can give you is when i go into the diag, i can enter the diag from any different direction and i know where i am. so it's very flexible and it allows us to find our way in environments, without having to to look at it from any particular direction. so it's not dependent on every single cue being there. um as in and one of the other things you think about is if we close our eyes we can sort of envision, certain environments. um i think of it as a looking-from-above view, where we don't really have to be in that environment in order to s- to have a vision or a map of it. okay so, and it's essential for world navigation, all creatures, have some form of spatial mapping. and there's been a lot of work done in the in this field. um i do have a theoretical definition that's taken from, um, a lot of the animal, literature and the scientists that work on learning and memory, um this is the one that i've chosen to use they're they're all i would say there's a high degree of agreement in the literature about what spatial mapping is. um darn you could try though well there's a lot of a lot of good things about the Morris water maze, um it um what it actually is it's a tub of water, um they usually color the water opaque and they put a little platform under the water and the little rat has to find the platform. swims around in the water and finds it. what they do is they measure the rat's ability after learning trials to find that hidden platform. so the other thing they do is they take away certain distal cues, to see if that rat actually has a cognitive map cuz one of the things about that cognitive map is, that you don't have to have every single cue in place right? so they can do a lot of different tests they can look and see how does that little rat search for that platform? they could do a lot of things to to uh measure, um cognitive maps in the Morris water maze, they can control the environment really well by putting in just the cues they want, they can assess all these different factors, um with the Morris water maze, so it's unfortunate that we can't use it in people. um, it's really a challenge to measure spatial mapping in elderly subjects which is my, um, area of interest, and i'm really interested in community dwelling, elderly which also makes it really kind of complex. um, we i- things to take into consider are motor and perceptual problems that elderly people can have, and how to create a real environment that is a controlled environment if i want to do an experimental type of test, um it could be very expensive, and, th- one of the biggest challenges is that, you know in rats we don't have to worry about super complex, mental abilities. but we do with, with human beings and, being able to tease out verbal learning strategies such as rehearsal and memorization based on verbal strategies versus actual hippocampc- hippocampal place cell activity is gonna probably be a challenge. one of the new things that's come out is virtual reality mazes where um, i have this little guy go into the computer because what they do is they try to create a simulated real environment on a computer screen. um the pros um are that they do they try to simulate a real-world spatial task, and i've actually logged in and seen some of these environments. and what they do is they have a person you can search around in this room, so they're trying to simulate a real, environment. it's very inexpensive it's actually free, to get the software, um you can measure very specifically how somebody went about searching, which is kind of a neat feature it's hard to do that in the real world, the con, the cons are that a two-D environment is theoretically different than a three-D environment. some of the things that we look at for a three-D, like a large-scale space, are that you can't see it from any one point in time and, you have cues that are around you, and it's it's not been, um, it's not real cons- um, consistent in the literature that this is a valid tool, and even the people that use, this, virtual reality say that they're not, a hundred percent positive they're measuring what they want to measure with it. the last thing is that computer skills are needed and since i'm interested in elderly subjects, that's something that could be a a roadblock to using, the computer, for that. um so i, i what i came up with, um thanks to some of uh, Lan's work that she actually showed us in Dr Terryman's class, was, the idea of a three-D human maze, which is really quite based on the Morris water maze without water, what it is it's a large tent-like, environment, that has cues placed around it, and you you do your experiment with the person having to replace, a test object in the same location. and you can do some of the same, types of tests that you can do with, um the Morris water maze you can remove certain cues and see if the person can still replace the test object, back where it originally was located. um. and you know the environment it's sort of a a shape that you can't, that would be not able to discern just based on the tent environment it would be more of a uh, uh the cues that the person's having to make a cognitive map with. so uh my operational definition of spatial mapping, is uh, the ability to measure, um, spatial, i should probably look this up cuz i didn't write it real well here did i? okay... wait just a minute okay. spatial mapping is defined as um yes, it's uh, now it's uh eight minutes. okay thanks is uh life-space mobility... okay? um uh when i started looking at_ what i really wanted to know is, how can we determine, how homebound somebody is, or how active they are in their environment how much they get out and about, and i started looking at things like mobility and what i find is that nursing tends to measure mobility in terms of functional status, and in terms of immobility. um (it kind of) measures S-F thirty-six and we also do measure i didn't put this on here physiologic measurement a lot of, different disciplines in the medical and nursing field, uh but how to measure the extent of mobility, that one was a little bit more difficult to find. um i did finally find after searching the psych literature a definition of something called life-space mobility. what that is is the spatial extent of mobility within one's environment. um there's different measures out there a couple different ones um, the one by May, is called life-space, um mobility questionnaire, and that one's within someone's home. and so it's specific for life-space mobility within a homebound, individual. um Tinetti's instrument life-space mobility, looks at the si- a similar type, um instrument is maze except it looks li- at it in an institutional setting. so more like in a nursing home. there's a lack of instruments, for the most part for looking at life-space mobility in the person's uh community. or community dwelling. i did find one questionnaire called the life-space questionnaire, it looks at life-space mobility for community-dwelling elderly. um what it does it's a just a questionnaire it has nine questions and it looks at the past three days of mobility, and they do have some reliability and validity measures that are all um adequate. the zones that are included are immediately outside of the home, outside of the home, then the neighborhood, and you can go on down and see they get gradually if you think about a concentric circle going out away from the person's home, that's what the life-space, questionnaire, looks at. the pros of using this questionnaire are that it's easy it's inexpensive, it's the only tool that's available for community dwelling elderly, and it does match with my theoretical definition, the cons are that, there's questionable, criterion validity. what i wondered is, it's only has nine points you get one point, and will it, will it actually distinguish between people's ability, uh to get out i mean especially if they only look at the past three days, i'm not sure how sensitive of an instrument that it is. um i've wondered if there's a weekly pattern to mobility especially in our elderly where maybe they go out every Thursday grocery shopping or whatever, and i wondered if only assessing on three days would, would not be a good i- good measure of what their actually mobility is. i thought also about ceiling effects -fects if they get all nine points and they do that in one day then that's all the nine points they get. um so i i wasn't sure that the way they scored it was good although i liked the zones. and i came up with some suggested modifications such as increasing, the, um seven day, the data collection to seven days, and doing a concurrent versus a retrospective data collection where you gave the person the instrument and told them to mark, every time they entered a zone. and then i also thought that, i would probably using this in the population i'm interested in remove the first zone, which i, which is actually like moved from the bedroom to the kitchen, you know and it just seemed like, it would be really difficult to do with people that were the least bit active. um i would probably change the scoring and have a total score, for um every day so they could get_ you know and uh, there's no ceiling effect at all as many times as they entered a zone they would get a point, and i would also suggest, increasing the number of points for zones that were further away, so we'd get more points for entering zones that were further out. so there's a lot of scoring changes although i do like the zones so, um, what i came up with for operational definition is the frequency of trips made within and outside of the home in specified zones over a period of seven days, measured using a modified version of the life-space questionnaire. RESTRICTED no it is a lighted tent, but it's a large-scale space in that you can't see the whole thing just standing in one place. RESTRICTED yeah like a more of an octagonal, type of shape and there's there's cues that are placed, throughout, the in_ tent-like environment. RESTRICTED yes. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED well, you know i thought about going into that more, but i think that's more a design of experiment, than defining operationalizing our concept, so i have to say i don't know yet. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah usually what they do is they they, uh what they did in the original experiment was gave them a model. where they could actually see how it was done and they showed them until the person was able to demonstrate on the model, and then they then they actually let them practice it in the real tent. there's a lot of debate about whether or not you should let somebody practice. so, i i need to take a lot of the theoretical RESTRICTED with spatial mapping, how do you account for the difference between men and women?    yeah and i suspect you're not going to find a gender difference in this test. yeah i don't i don't know that we will. find much of a difference. actually i have two questions. okay oh  yes they are um i'm, what one of my, like semi-hypothesis i'll say, is that i wonder, i i'm really interested in environmental enrichment how enriched somebody's environment is, there's a lot of um, rat experime- experiments that show that if you have an enriched environment for an old rat, they will improve their spatial mapping abilities. and i'm interested_ they actually grow better, better dendrites  yeah the other of my question is that you said that you would, um modify the scale for the life-space mobility  that i think i would have to pilot-test it. but you could do  yeah, i think there'd be a way to design it,   yeah do you a have a quick, something added to that but have you heard about pedometer? oh, yeah for measuring distance walking. yeah we we can, measure some, the mobility like a with the pedometer how far for today, yeah  so you need  what's what's yeah. i'm serious   no no no i'm just saying if you want to know, truly how far away, it would be a way that they didn't have to do anything that the, computer would say, they were,  yeah, is there like a that, that's kinda related to the question i had in thinking about this have you given some thought to your target, sample because, um, with both of these measures, functional limitations will affect, the results, um say that you have somebody on oxygen or somebody who uses a walker or somebody, who has other types of assistive devices and i was wondering if you had given any thought to, how they would be able to complete both of those measures it may be due to some other,  i would have to have a very uh um stringent criteria for for a moment in this study. and, um, i would probably, want to avoid having a very heterogeneous group some people who could, were totally bed-bound and other people that were, um, you know, running marathons. so i would have to take that into consideration. that again is something that'll be in next week's paper for Dr Terryman, RESTRICTED  the, the other thing i was wondering about theoretically the way the zones, mhm  uhuh i thought about that too and i also thought about, what would probably go into the community senior center is a very engaging, enriching opportunity and it may only be two doors down from you, versus going to the doctor's office which might be a more stressful and less enriching type of experience.  yeah. RESTRICTED  well and, and then there's_ the question is if you don't ever, do you lose some ability, to  yeah yeah so wow. yeah  mhm  yup cuz little kids (xx) mhm yeah i think, i heard uh, someone in uh um, uh what is this uh uh department of architecture, um they when they build like a um retirement housing, or um the complex for different uh elderly care, they really look into that kind of the combination of their function, and also their uh social skill and, uh so that may be it's interesting. something yeah. great. um i appreciate all your comments that'll help me for my next paper one step ahead okay well thank you very much... the next is, Nancy? is anybody else like boiling hot or is that like adrenaline?     i turn off the  you can also open the window if you want it's so cold and then it's just, so interesting RESTRICTED okay.   it might just have to be open for some reason (xx.) it's very slow. yeah especially compared to my computer at   RESTRICTED right. RESTRICTED mhm. do you have any more oh no this is the wrong one. there's a lot of superstition around (who uses it) uh, Eastern European uhuh so- someone said this came from European language (xx) huh?    oh we've just always Melissa you got me so excited. no you're not.  (easy?) yeah i just, pulled up the wrong one. oops. okay good.  RESTRICTED well it's similar but it's, doesn't haven't the right stuff in it. RESTRICTED like some (of the title wrong) the title's not going to change at all... oh yeah. i heard they did that here just a couple years ago didn't they? here um it's happening on a smaller scale they're laying off, they didn't lay off all their nurse practitioners, mhm how could we forget? it's had um multiple, no i  it's the Mackinaw. come on we're in Michigan. um health care culture is the box around and, i um it's very interesting when i, when i tried when you even try to define culture it's very difficult to do, and i know it's spelled wrong by the way, um, and so i've decided that yeah i'm gonna acknowledge that health care culture's out there and it can have positive and negative effects, i think of it as the um, cloud that contracts and expands, um, and i'm just gonna acknowledge that it's there but i'm really not gonna look at it. definition. uh profession, this definition is by Hall, and you got it a little bit earlier, but i'm, defining it specifically as these components RESTRICTED right. um, basically it's you know because, yes and no, is the answer. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED no actually it wasn't (xx.) RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i'm not looking at commitment to the role. i'm looking at commitment to the profession... i think they're two different things. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yes. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED no. i think that, that nurse practitioners are a part of the profession of nursing it's just that in this the it's the only way to look at this particular, issue. is to to tease them out. and that's where i, told you i got in this real problem when, i was using advanced practice nursing and, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED the other thing is there is some theoretical underpinnings it's really looking using um, uh social, social marketing and ecological, and sort of together. the last one for today is Lynne, then next week um, Julie you can, go i can't believe i tested it on my, two different computers in my own house to see if it would open and it did, and it won't open here. oh... you may wanna ask uh i i'm sure that something happened to my disk on the way  the other thing that you can do is yo- you can put your file on your server, as a back-up. i just figured if it opened up at home it would open here. no then you know   RESTRICTED yes. actually i might try to open it again. (xx) RESTRICTED (xx) RESTRICTED don't you hate that? RESTRICTED yeah i know i didn't feel like sitting on this for another week. RESTRICTED here... oh did you close properly? (xx) RESTRICTED uh that's fine with me. as far as i can  RESTRICTED (xx) measure? RESTRICTED here's my paper. the computer's been having computer problems. well it did help that the computer was bad. have we started yet? we're gonna get done don't worry RESTRICTED RESTRICTED this RESTRICTED looks good. although i wish i could have given my RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED eight minutes, left. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED so you're interested in primary prevention. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and then yo- you included, by nurses in definition so uh what was the intention to, include you know the provider rather than_ yo- you are interested in outcome, but you define, the, the, person who can provide that with image. so so i- if the social workers or, um, health educators, provide same education uh material you don't consider that as a (positive outcome.) RESTRICTED well i think you can um, in the definition of the term, you can still maintain some level of ambiguity or, abstract uh, and then, you know when you come to operational definition, or design, you can define you know the (xx) and for your case, um the nurses provide these care. (but i) don't think, you wants to well unless the, um the nurses, as a provider, are key to your concept or the, the phenomena, and i just didn't think that was a key. RESTRICTED (as if) allergic reaction. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED mhm i have uh, i was thinking about your injury prevention, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED mhm RESTRICTED and so well isn't it, isn't it addressed in help_ i think injury prevention is addressed in Helping People two thousand and ten isn't it? yeah. yeah.  RESTRICTED right. RESTRICTED you'll be happy to know that, the only person, in my pediatrician's office that does, any injury, prevention teaching is  RESTRICTED  um family practice physicians usually, use you know the guideline issued by, American Pediatric uh Pediatrician uh American, what is the, American  American Academy of Pediatricians they have a set of guideline, for injury prevention. RESTRICTED mhm okay, so the next week uh start with Julie and then Nah-mee Lau- uh Laureen, Junah, Jermporn and then Ranlan. okay. 	1
LES425SU093.json	okay um, the midterm is a week from today,  uh i'm not sure what i'm gonna do yet. i- i wanted to uh, take a vote on, i have to change my review session, for extenuating circumstances, like i can't control them, so it could either be Sunday at five, or Monday, maybe at four or five. now, i don't like to, take away, a lot of the weekend time so i wanted to ask you would you rather have it Sunday, or Monday? Sunday. fine Sunday at five it is. alright great. the topic for today's lecture is river floodplains, and what we're gonna be doing is_ first i wanna talk about, the larger picture what it means, a watershed is and what drainage basins are. and then we'll look at some specific drainage patterns which are actually, on page ninety-five i think, yeah in your coursepack. and then we'll talk about the different processes, that are, that go on surrounding a river, followed by the specific landforms of the floodplain, the climate of the floodplain, soils and vegetation of the floodplain. and then if we have time we'll look at slides, of, um last week's lab, when we went to Sharon Hollow. okay, so the first thing, is talking about this idea of a watershed, and what that means and so up here on the board i wrote this definition there, there're a variety of definitions about, of watersheds, or of a drainage basin, but this one seems to be pretty inclusive, saying that why did you subtract, the forty from the sixty? is that the forty is like the threshold? forty is the uh, forty is a threshold where, plants won't really be meta- they won't be metabolically active, until it's forty degrees Fahrenheit. and then once it starts getting warmer, then it's like well it can't just be you know a really nice day in February, for f- for plants to flush out but they have to, accumulate so much heat over a particular you know time period. so then they know that well it s- it's safe enough in this region that i'm not gonna be susceptible to late spring frost. i'm putting, human, vocabulary and then if it gets cold, does that, so, i guess, looking at the heat sum, they're accumulating but then if it gets cold, does it subtract from that or  what about like cold air flowing down into the valley.  well it does but the difference is that when you're adjacent to a river, so the channel's really open, it's not windy down there and cold air is able to be, you know breezed out of there. and also because we're adjacent to water, it's more humid, and there are site conditions that, during the day it's not as hot, because you're adjacent to the water, and there's cool, cool air that stays adjacent to- above_ cool air masses above the water, it stays adjacent there, but then over the d- the day the water takes a long time to warm up, but eventually it does and at night, it's actually warmer air masses over that water. okay so it's it's moderated in that sense too not only, is it a seasonal moderat- seasonally moderated, but daily, it's- the days aren't as hot, and the nights aren't as cold. so it's sort of a double double whammy there. plants, are have, you know, there's a- this is great climatically for plants down in, this, bottomland. are there other questions about that? so everybody understand the concept of accumulated heat, for flushing out...? did you have a question Norman...? okay, so that is just looking at, the climate and because of this we have a lot of different microclimates, located in the river floodplain. uh looking at that profile, you notice th- it's very, much there's a lot of ups and downs in there. so we have, a little microclimate similar to what we saw in the lake plain, but even more on a larger scale. could you guys close the, shades in the back, no (just wanted to know if) you know, are we supposed to get rained on today? yeah, all day. that's good for mosquitoes though. i mean, good for, not having as many mosquitoes.    Cancer Root? Cancer Root. and the family? a family that's all, um, wholly parasitic? Orobanchaceae Rattlesnake fern. Rattlesnake fern yeah. now how do you know it's not a sort of fern? and it's not as leathery. it's not as leathery so at the touch. and then this is the key thing. the fertile frond?  no it won't always have the fertile fronds um, uh, i mean, generally when we we quiz you we try to, give you that stuff but the feel of it is much different, as well. if you s- for example if you had this, in a vegetative, (forunno,) fertile part, and you have um are the other Botrychiums that like triangle shape? yeah they are. they are?   Adiantaceae Adiantaceae. and the common name? Maidenhair Fern? Maidenhair Fern. excellent. Sensitive Fern. yeah exactly. you guys are good. this is Sensitive Fern. Onoclea An Apiaceae? An Apiaceae yeah so this, this cau- i- the first frost, it's down and that's why it's, has it's common name and, and uh, species name. ooh is that someone's finger? or sanguinaria sanguinaria. sang-   sang-  Papaveraceae Papaveraceae right. it's the poppy family. so i- you know opium comes from the um, the latex of the poppy, of the poppy plant. same stuff i don't know if you (you've heard) enough of this (on Fri-) Hydrophyllum? what's that? Hydrophyllum? n- oh this is still Bloodroot, sorry. oh that's a  Bloodroot i'm sorry. can't you tell?   those are petals the white parts are petals yep. very showy flower, Papaveraceae. so and this is what it looks like when- we're doing a little, stroll down, Sanguinaria, avenue. this is the, um, the leaf. obviously. many lobes very, distinctive, in its sort of orbicular shape with those, strange lobes. and then this is the fruit, and it's opened up and those are the seeds inside, the little pod. huh, yeah Bishop's Cap, mitella   diphylla ooh nice aw Squirrel Corn. ew oh God didn't make it to the finals didn't make the finals yeah didn't make it to the finals right. lost him out at Sharon Hollow. um,   Fumariaceae Fumariaceae exactly. and here's the other one. (xx) this is oh those are the flowers. so don't they look like little pants, they're cute  no, although that's a good guess.  the white stuff? the white stuff. (xx) it's a what? Anemone? anatomy? sepals? not- no stamens no stigmas stigmas, showy stigmas. what has showy stigmas, as the sort of, most showy part of the plant? is that, Hydrastis? nope not Hydrastis. this is, very cruel. okay.   oh ah, oh what's this? i don't know what it is.  Ranunculaceae Ranunculaceae it's called White Baneberry. um may have told you that another common name is Doll's Eye, and there's the eye of the Doll's Eye so it's got a white berry with a, black top. it's a little creepy, sometimes too so (if i-) but p- i'll tell you what pa- y- does anyone know what pachypoda means? sounds like pachyderm.  i always think elephant when i say it. cuz it's like   May Apple May Apple. what's the family? Berberidaceae Berberidaceae which is the same family as Blue Cohosh Blue Cohosh which is    yes exactly. (xx) what's that? Downy Solomon's Seal Downy Solomon's Seal yep. scientific name? (xx) (melaeic) yep. don't tell em. look at the stamen. what's going on with the stamens just, you know, observationally? Wild Geranium? it's not Wild Geranium... is it the Hairy Sweet Sicily? no, not Hairy Sweet Sicily. i'm stumped  large (xx) no. okay here's- here's a quick hint but you gotta, you gotta look at it fast. (xx)  ah oh the Great Water Leaf the Great Water Leaf     can you go back to uh, can you go back one? sure, this one, or the one before? on the, um, on the, on adult (appendiculatum) the stamens are longer than the, petals. longer  exerted they're kind of (xx) sticking out there. the other thing is too, (drain leaf is more,) cut into pieces and is more together. yeah, yeah, that's uh true. okay, so quiz at, one ten. and you are free to go. 	1
LEL115SU005.json	just don't wanna, do the wrong thing and then have somebody's lawyer call me in the morning saying, my client was recorded against his will. okay, um we did we talked about medical ecology, on Monday, and today we're gonna talk a little bit about, epidemiology this is my favorite epidemiology cartoon. i don't know why i get such a kick out of this but uh, bu- but i do and you know, here are two of just the clueless children that are gonna come out here and say oh yippee. can i get a shot too? so, epidemiology is not a subfield of medical anthropology uh, lest, you think um, that it is because we're going to be talking about it today as a matter of fact there are many people, for whom the two sciences seem absolutely impossible to uh to reconcile. epidemiologists have one way to justify, their claims to knowledge about events of uh sickness and healing, they have their own way of achieving knowledge their own way of verifying this new knowledge about sickness and health, and anthropologists have another and one which is uh, which was quite different. among practitioners of both disciplines both epidemiology and anthropology as well as among their audiences, the two uh are sometimes regarded as pretty tangential, uh to one another if not entirely antithetical there are people who, when you ask them to think about epidemiology and think about anthropology, uh, would feel as if we're talking about two opposite ends uh of the spectrum, here. epidemiology is seen, first of all as a completely objective science. it's seen as an objective science that focuses on, associations, that are very clearly specified... it uses variables that are very, precisely defined. and the way it looks at those associations is through things like measurement and counting, and statistical analysis. so one definition of epidemiology, might be, the scientific assessment of clearly specified associations, among precisely defined variables, through measurement and counting and statistical, analysis. anthropologists have accused epidemiologists of being totally immersed, in their own particular scientific bias and my favorite quote made by an anthropologist about an epidemiologist is that, epidemiology practices rigor to the point of rigor mortis. is is this idea of risk tied in at all to probability? yea- uh i think that that risk is tied to probability tremendously in e- in epidemiology, and, a lot, but uh, but in a in a more liquid way in clinical medicine, mhm i mean it's obvious that people did this, and that in order for companies or whatever to protect themselves because they paid two-point-seven million dollars to this idiot, who couldn't figure out to blow on the   yes. yes. we do not  i was just gonna say it's not about being scared it's about, liability. exactly exactly exactly it's about lawsuits that's what it is about. and it shows how we can tap into, um cultural ideas and solutions from one realm and apply them elsewhere using the language of risk yeah Sue. the only thing (tha-) that i have a question on about lawsuits i mean that's the first thing that comes up or that we think about it's about being sued mhm mhm,    okay there was something at the end of that, uh where they not to the class to the to the graduate students oh sorry  yeah mm   mhm i don't know except that what i think is that it's discontinuous i think that maybe there was this, there were lawsuits in the past and there were laws in the past, and then things things changed, okay? and now we have new laws and we have a new a new peak i think there probably was a trough, somewhere i don't think it's it's continuous such that here's where it was and now we're here, i think it probably looks more like that because the kinds of liability laws we have, there are so many of them that are new, um i'm not really sure cuz i_ although i recommended (that) people watch that show, i myself did not watch that show. okay. i found this example which is my favorite okay? about about using the language of risk and tapping into because you know you can't really put something on on a s- on a stepladder that says don't be stupid, or don't be a negligent parent, you know that sort of thing, but but the language of risk in terms of injury and illness is is a a is an acceptable way to be able to warn people, it looks as if it's beneficent and also it carries a tremendous amount of of power, and we can even use this to lie. this is my absolute uh favorite example. Victor Schwartz is a corporate lawyer, whose job is to defend companies against product liability claims, and this was his finest moment. in the early nineteen eighties, teenagers discovered lo and behold that they could get high by spraying one of his client's cleaning products into a plastic bag and inhaling the fumes fabulous discovery okay? the label on the can clearly warned that serious injury and death, could result from inhaling the product but this carried very little sway with teenagers looking to get high as you might imagine. and there were deaths and there was brain damage and there was all sorts of horrible stuff. the company said to Mr Schwartz, we want to put an even bigger label on the can and he said, don't put a bigger label on the can because if you put a bigger scarier label on the can then teeathers w- teenagers will assume, there's even more good stuff in the can now, and uh and they and they will they will use it even even more. new improved uh you know, death spray motor vehicle accidents and drunk driving are   cause it says alcohol-related, but um, i'm wondering if they want you to take out of that alcohol-related that's in some other category too, or if it's just supposed to be sort of aggregate, alcohol-related. but, and i don't know the answer to that so... football? i'm surprised you left drowning off. did i leave  it's on there, it's there. oh sorry. i thought it was on there. i have a question can you tell me where_ what you know this is from because i think my public health professor would like it a lot yeah sure, i mean it's (this) it there's an article in Consumer Reports that, um (uh) December nineteen ninety-six okay? thank you uhuh and um what they have in here is it, they gave this as a survey to um (some) two hundred consumers un- consumer union staffers (xx) okay right i should've asked you to estimate how many deaths per year... (xx) God, she's not very confident about her answers and i'm just give_ helping her out a little bit... Marie just keep your eyes on your own paper ready we're ready okay. i have here, the actual correctly ordered list, and then, just for fun, you can_ you could score yourself if you want to and then i then i'll collect it and i'll present you with the aggregate data after spring break. that's how long it takes an anthropologist to analyze aggregate data with an N of forty it takes her a week. okay. these are the cause of death, hm let's see does that does that hide the number pretty well? yes okay. here is the order. okay? let's take these one at a time. how many U-S deaths per year do you think there there are from tobacco use which is number one on this list? di- d- did everybody have number one anyone have number one was this? alright. four of you okay, okay, anyone wanna take a guess, how many deaths per year of tobacco use...? we're not numbers crunching folks  two hundred two hun- two hundred  when they say tobacco use do they mean, like cancer caused by tobacco use or (are) they talking about heart disease too and they also mean probably  emphysema and and also n- smokeless tobacco and, uh i don't know maybe fires? death  i don't know they'd they're they're not  ninety. ninety? ninety thousand someone said? eighty? well, go drive but don't smoke. forty-two thousand,  ah... this where i got this from, was, consumer's union uh was trying to assess, how well, their employees a random sample of two hundred people who work for consumer's union, now if you work for consumer's union you are like intimately involved with this four foot label on the piece of red plastic okay? so they asked these folks who were the heads of departments or something like that to to do this rank and this is where this is how close they got to the actual rank order so you'll see that as we go down. okay. second hand smoke how many people a year? thirty-five  oh very close, forty thousand. (and it's) fourth and consumer's union, employees thought it was seven. okay. AIDS this is i believe this was published in December (of) ninety-six and they said that they were uh like probably the previous calendar year so maybe we're talking nineteen ninety-five in the U-S, deaths from AIDS. thirty-seven? twenty-five...? pretty close. thirty thousand. so you know that it's gonna be less than the number above it so it's not even_ i shouldn't even make you guess because it's already been given away. okay? so this was, second hand smoke was uh underestimated and death from AIDS was overestimated. drunk driving seventeen thousand... radon from lung cancer. i was astounded, by this. thirteen thousand six hundred people. radon is that inert gas that you don't know anything about but it's in your basement, okay... and consumer_ the consumer's union folks were surprised about this too because they put it down at seventeen out of twenty-two and it's way up there. food poisoning. falls in the home and i had to laugh because they obviously don't have my stepladder they couldn't fall off that thing, if you read the label first, it's foolproof. here's drowning and i- and it's a big number Sue that's why, it's good that it's there. fires in the home. X-rays, these uh by X-rays they meant, things that were ordered by doctors in hospitals to have X-rays not like, you got zapped by an alien this is this is legitimate you were supposed to have this X-ray X-ray kills you. bike accidents... carbon monoxide poisoning... there's hunting accidents... lightning, and we know that there's that one guy from that movie, but it's they're really not i mean, it's_ you have to weigh (the) statistically they're not really safer, it's just less people hang glide than play football less people skydive than ski so okay wait and isn't it also depending on like the age group that you're_ cuz i think like accidents are the number one killer between, people ages you know fifteen to twenty-four  actually a wider range than that, cuz  right it's almost everybody it's al- yeah.  but then in the upper age groups you know, it's not right (tha-) clearly risk is not uh is not distributed across a population and it's interesting to look at something like this, a- to look at this kind of a chart, and and do something just like this, and um, wh- what uh the folks who did this survey found, was that i- if they if you ask people to describe, um a chart like this and talk about risk (if we wanted to) talk about the risk of all these sorts of things, people will construct, their own very interesting narrative, of risk having to do with which of these have something to do with them and which of these do not. and a- you know you can certainly look at that and say you know well, who'd be_ who's so stupid as to go hang gliding, uh you know and and and maybe a cigarette smoker saying you know of course i'd never be so stupid as to go hang gliding uh maybe there's some sort of uh something um, interestingly different from that. a- when i did um some research with uh lung cancer patients um i'm not sure if i told you all about this or if we just talked about breast cancer in here, but um asking lung cancer patients who were smokers, to describe for me what caused th- what they thought caused their lung cancer, was quite an interesting experience, because i had um patients who had smoked, three or four packs of cigarettes a day, for fifty years, describing the onset of their lung cancer this way. if anyone wants an extra one of these just to, amaze your friends feel free to take one. uh i see some answers changed here. y- no- everyone's g- no one's gonna be changing answers, are they? are you gonna be (xx) (um,) yeah um let's see i have a meeting tomorrow at ten fifteen. um do you wanna meet before (or after?) (xx) either (xx) how m- how much time (xx) (xx) just to discuss with (me my assignment) um why don't we you wanna say (like um two o'clock?) (would that be okay? in my office?) (xx) um yeah (xx) unle- unless if you wanna do it on email we could do it that way too (xx) if it's if it's too much i'll just (xx) (no) message me tonight an- and tell me one way or the other (just) say, let's meet tomorrow and give me a time alright alright thank you um the other thing i didn't understand... why didn't the Canadian government just train people... (xx) to do s- to do it there? like (xx) Keewatin (xx) why? because um, they really believe that that um, no matter how much training you have what you really need is a hospital where you can do an emergency C-section, where you can have all the monitors and stuff like that, and they really believed, that it was important to get them out of that environment and into, a healthier environment. they if if they had wanted to see what they could do to make it the most culturally appropriate thing for these folks, they might have done that, but their belief was that technology was the way to go even more so, if they (xx) right yeah you know it's interesting there's um there's a a huge amount of paternalism that goes that goes into this and the kinds of of of power, that you_ the ways in which you can reinforce your power and status by, by making this happen all over, um, is worth it uh to a lot of places, but also don't don't underestimate th- fact that they can then say that our infant mortality rates are are the best. there's there- there's a huge amount of of national prestige and also funding, uh and that sort of thing that you get by changing your infant mortality ratings, and um and if it costs more, to make your numbers look better, then that's what they (will do.) mm it's like taking a Stanley Kaplan course that'll bring your your numbers up on the on (the) (xx) and it's that's it's worth it, it's wor- you bump those numbers up, it's worth paying that amount on on that one test, it's worth paying those you know thousands of dollars to do it and it was very important for the government to look as if especially after they had had this um problem with lots and lots of infant deaths uh from starvation they really were looking at, these backward Indians were making Canada look like a backward country (in that way) yeah. (sure) i'll look forward to reading it. would they have done the same thing, for, say, an inner city (urban?) i wonder that's a very good question. um, i wonder if it'd be harder for them to do, because it's um, because, what they were dealing with was a traditional sort of folk practice, versus modern medicine, as opposed to uh people who were classified as underprivileged or deprived in some way. um, it was it was jus- it was uh, it was technology over, native practice, it didn't have to do so much with access to scarce resources, in in a different sort of way. so i don't think that the Canadian government has done the same sorts of things, for people who, wh- where the issue is poverty, so much as, as technology. technology was really what was driving it but if you look at like really rural very isolated, mhm  right right yeah, right  yeah because um, if you look at, like Appalachian mhm right right right  okay okay? i don't actually have a question (so i'll) um, i didn't either (xx) mhm mhm um, we tend if you if you look at infant mortality and and perinatal mortality statistics, they serve as kind of a gloss for how advanced a civilization is it's really interesting if you if you uh, if you look at those sorts of statistics that's what's, uh stat- th- of all the statistics that they could publish, uh that's  so that's what they used (xx) that's one of th- yeah they s- they you know there's all this data that's there already and they can just change things around and say look how much, how much better our numbers are, when uh the numbers being better didn't have much to do with with hospital births because it_ that's not why infants were dying to begin with right, so you know once that was over and done with uh, (then...) it didn't matter anymore but they could use the numbers to their right 	1
COL485MX069.json	for the um, for the last three days we have, been feting, Professor Veltman, and uh trying to pay him the honor, that we all feel, for what he has accomplished over the course of his career, and what has just been recognized with the award of the Nobel Prize. uh today, is really, the best part, of his visit. and by the way we are, especially uh indebted to him for coming back to the University of Michigan so qu- so quickly, after having been awarded the Nobel Prize. Teeny said that it was odd, being in, his house, in Holland, utterly anonymous on one day and having the world at his doorstep the next thank you President Bollinger, and good afternoon ladies and gentleman and welcome to this special public lecture, honoring our colleague, Professor Martinus Veltman, the winner, of the nineteen ninety-nine Nobel Prize in Physics. woo i have a bit of a problem, which i'll try to explain to you further before we go into, the details, of the, lecture i want to give. the problem is i i really have for this long lecture i really had a hard time, of preparing it. normally when i do a lecture, i start thinking about it real long ago, it forms in my head and then one day one hour i sit down and i write the whole thing. but this, i hadn't done that of course before i got this prize i really had no inkling i would would be standing here at this time, even if i might have been thinking about a Nobel Prize i didn't think of its consequence see so you understand what i'm saying. (xx) i just have to (xx) so that's the zed-zero and of course here comes the m- thi- this is really what i am trying to tell you here is a game and that i'll give you some indication i don't know where my time i guess must be more or less over. eighty-nine. eighty-nine. and there was, what they call LEP, functioning. and that machine, has established, this way of thinking and calculating to a degree of a precision, which is uh, very very very high. what will be the future of this business? well, if you keep on playing the game that i am telling you, there is one particle, everybody was found except there was one, called a Higgs Particle just try to remember that name. which in the whole affair plays, a role that i am saying here it is there to damp off certain reactions in an appropriate manner. but it is sort of a, what it has to do the job it has to do, is just killing off some remnant. so it's a particle whose work is uh sort of light in the context, of this whole affair. it's not so uh so strong. it's somewhere in the background and you're not, in fact you start feeling uneasy you're not really sure, whether you need it or not or what is it? and there is another thing about that particle, is that it has, uh, bad side effects. and the side effects are, that this particle does something with gravitation which uh which is, enormously bothersome. what it does it creates, an energy in the vacuum all around the universe, and now that there is an energy around in the universe doesn't bother you so much because you know there it is and how do you see it? but the fact is gravitation worries about that. and Einstein has explained to us, that if you have a lot of energy around, the space gets curved. now if you look tomorrow to the football game, ladies and gentlemen let me ask you something i've had a dream when i was young. there was a movie by Charlie Chaplan called the Great Dictator. yeah? in this Charlie Chaplan plays Adolf Hitler, and makes a joke of it. but it also had a beautiful scene. the sp- the Fuhrer gave a speech yeah? and he would halt and everyone knew that you had to applaud and shout thank you very much Professor Veltman for a marvelous introduction to the mysterious world of particle physics. and i'm sure Professor Veltman would be, happy to take some of the questions from the audience, please. yes? when you draw the positron, is there a significance to drawing the arrow in the opposite direction  does the W particle have mass? which one? does the W particle have mass? which which particle? W. W? oh bloody heavy. (in your) country, country (xx) of that uh, bubble chamber which you show in the beginning, was invented, in this department? yes. what uh, Professor Tomozawa is referring to is that, here in Michigan, Mich- i find Michigan University modest to a degree which i don't think is realistic. they all only talk about professor being so-called faculty members. well i'm, in a sense i'm gone you know which they count anyway they have a counting method. yeah? but Mr Glaser, did his invention while drinking beer, somewhere in the Brown Jug or something yeah? and he invented the bubble chamber. this is uh, recorded in the book by Leon Lederman called The God Particle, so if you want to know more details you can read it in that book. and after he invented the bubble chamber he moved somewhere else well we move all the time, i've been at CERN, Utrecht, Michigan, all of us have become an international brand of people, yeah? uh so i would say that uh, uh Mr Gl- to me the important thing is that Mr Glaser could do his invention here, and the University was providing all the facilities and possibilities for doing so and if you are smart enough and inventive enough you can do something. that's the important thing, for all i care they may take, Mr Glaser's contribution as something, part of this University, yeah? so that's what you hear said. does your diagram show that the gamma? place 'em through a positron and electron. yes the positron what? the positron and electron combine to form a (Z) zero well they can combine again and become a g- a gamma again, i see Sebastian? um, we know, as you said that that there are photons and neutrinos and such, racing all around all the time, we seen 'em they only appear if you have more energy than needed to generate ninety G-E-V of mass. so you must have a machine that accelerate particles to at least that energy and there aren't that many, machines of that type. yeah? but once you have it you create 'em. now the other thing is, just because they are so heavy, there is a lot of energy there and they decay very very quickly. so these vector bosons and zed-zeros decay in such a short time you can see that you certainly not do beams with them or anything like it. yeah? but there are other methods for getting onto it. (there're) many methods but i would need would need much more time to explain it. yeah?  just kinda curious, we all are  yeah this the second question to that is, do you have a feel if, we're approaching, some sort of top limit of the number of particles or, are we gonna con- continue looking, are we kind of at the beginning or  sure okay, so i tell you what are, more or less the particles that we know today. thank you very much and i understand President Bollinger will have some closing remarks. uh, just very briefly i wanna say again, uh to Professor Veltman, how grateful we are, for sharing in the excitement of this moment. uh we know that uh more than anything, uh because you said this last night that you are, desirous of returning back to your home, closing the door, 	1
LEL195SU120.json	exciting isn't it? it is so exciting. (xx) no? we're doing it now. oh you're doing it now. so have you done the log mean driving force for a heat exchanger? no not yet okay. well, you will, and you'll enjoy it. um on your graph i seen where you got delta from how that was ya- Y minus Y-star. but is del- delta-in, is that Y-in, just like the distance of Y-in to the equilibrium line? right delta-in is Y-in minus Y-in-star. it's just that, oh excuse me? uh you just go over here and, Y-in is like point-zero-one and the Y-star is zero and then for the input it's point-seven, and you go down and it's point, zero-four-two. you just go, go over and go down, alright what is the units on the uh seven-point-two?  cubed is our equilibrium line straight or curved? doesn't matter. okay. okay. i do a curve purposefully to say that it can be linear or nonlinear. cuz yo- what you're gonna do is get those, Y_ now it's gonna be, capital Y and, capital Y-stars and then you convert them and plug them into the equation and that's what i'm gonna show you. okay...? okay. Mr Burns? yes? wh- what again are L-S and G-S?  (xx) yes. i'm wrong? i didn't mean to say that out loud you just thought it really loud, and then heard it. (i have a question.) will you repeat what you just said about, the varying? i don't know the very last thing (that you) oh yeah it's this, this term we're taking the derivative of it that's where we get that one minus Y, squared, oh Y is (approximately equal to the) capital Y? how does, Y compare to capital Y when the concentration is low. i'm sorry what did you say? i said Y is approximately equal to the capital Y. yes. they're about the same. once you g- start getting up above point-zero-five it starts changing and up above point-one, is really concentrated. okay? so typically is L-S sorry someone yeah sorry. is uh, L-S supposed to be, pound-moles per hour feet cubed? uh, no. squared per cross-sectional area so it's like a velocity. right this is the weird unit, that i always forget pound-moles per hour per feet squared. it was that K-Y-A that had the cube. okay um, just like the Ys are similar for dilute solution is i- is it the same for L S and M? they're  okay. quiet please. if you go through and then do, part B um, is this equation L equals L-S over one minus X (i mean it's) or is it capital, capital X-in or small X? i know it doesn't matter for this case but well if i want L-in then i use X-in. which is  but does it matter if that's the small X or the capital X? i mean i know it doesn't matter  okay mm whoa yes and you won't want to go to heat and mass transfer because we're doing mass transfer here. so what's the point? no go kay. so heat, if it's really hot and really cold over here heat goes that way right? yeah (xx) i i don't know. right? it's kind of, diffusion cuz it's moving by diffusion but the diffusion itself causes some, convection of mass and if you were standing here if there were molecules here they keep getting since um, the top quiet please. since the top of (xx) dilute solution, yes yes. okay. yeah the, we have the dilute solution equation we have this equation which you probably shouldn't use, unless there's a reason like it's too complicated to do the full equation. and we have the full equation. mkay? this is the one, that we're gonna focus on... have a good weekend. have a tremendous, superior, uh, jejune, prosaic, wait 	1
LEL300SU076.json	so no yeah thank you... alrighty. i think they picked the wrong day to come tape this. i told them in advance that half of today's lecture is gonna be in Spanish, but, as we say in Spanish it was much easier to follow the movie was easier to follow? yeah, i mean i i didn't think that   after. i thought it was better in the book... you thought the relationship was better in the book than the_  was better in the book. yeah so which was harder to follow? um, well, the book as a whole that was harder to follow. than the movie yeah anybody else share that view? anybody have the opposite view? yes? speak. um, i had to see the movie first actually for a class, and i remember, at first i, louder louder i i must say, i saw the movie first. then i read the book, in English. then i read the book in Spanish. then i saw the movie again. and, my own view is that a lot of what i saw in the movie, seemed a little disjointed. and only when i saw, when i saw in the book how those must've actually been flashbacks or just, you know expanding episodes, that i realized why it was put in there. so i found the movie much better on second viewing after having read the novel. so, personally, i found the movie less, well integrated. you guys know that the director of the movie is the husband of the woman who wrote the book. Arau is Esquivel's husband so, it's a a power couple in Mexico. uh, i saw some nods so, some of you also had my view that the book, the movie was was harder than the book. the movie was good, right? you know that movie made more money than any other foreign language movie in America up until that time. Liz? i haven't seen the movie but i just noticed that, the people who had spoke_ and your view is that whatever they saw or read first was harder to follow, she said she saw the movie first and that was,  is that right? is there anybody for whom that is not true? is there anybody for whom that is_ it's not true for you. speak, please. well, it's because i read the first couple pages of the book, ahh, so the book made a nice guide to the movie. right. okay, alright. it is confusing though which i must say, i find really kind of amazing, when you realize the exquisite simplicity of the language. i mean they're not complicated sentences, there aren't very odd adjectives. and it's it it's not like Faulkner at all you know it's just you you can read every sentence clearly, and yet there's something wild about it. um, do you guys like the book? yes (xx) dishtowels dishtowel. thank you, right it was not a washcloth. dishtowel. good. how do you say in English? right? a dishtowel covering her lap. and she'd reach under the dishtowel, take out a couple of potatoes, and say A Year in Provence by Peter Mayle. good, you wanna describe it? um, it's also in segments of monthl- monthly periods. and he bought a house in Provence and dicruss discusses the meals and the recipe he, the recipes that he uses throughout the book so, it reminded me of that. but that's nonfiction. right. but, yes? in a way it sort of reminded me of Cosmic Comics where you have the scientific fact at the beginning and then it_ (xx) kind of played with it, throughout the chapter interesting. i think there's another uh way in which those two books are alike, which i hadn't thought we'd get to until the end of today but, remember wha- i how i was talking about Frie's notion of going through the different archetypes until you get so ironic that it comes out to be a new myth? i think that's sort of what's going on here. you get so, off the deep end you you wind up with a whole new myth. although what that myth might be, something you know we probably oughta go through the book more before we talk about. yeah, but that's certainly not the recipe aspect of it that's the same. any of you guys read Babette's Feast? no, or see that movie? no. how bout Heartburn, has anybody ever read Heartburn? oh, really great novel, you gotta read this novel, it's really cool. um, it's written by, uh, Nora Efron, who was married to Bob Woodward from Bernstein, Woodward, Deep Throat all that stuff. and the son of a bitch divorced her can you move over just a little bit? oh, i'm sorry. thanks. sure. hm, this may be tough... mhm no. y- yes okay. so, if that is the case, let's take a look at the end. what should we be making, of the world if we have the opportunity? if we have the recipes? starting down about a quarter of the way from the bottom of page two-forty-two. 	1

(xx) why does it matter how many we took? remember the (grashopper) (xx) ah you've done you've done one already have you? we did (xx) we did like an actual experiment. it's easy with M-and-Ms it works with M-and-Ms. no, actually, oh does anyone have a calculator? i do. just if you could total the number for me it would make my life easier. seventy-seven. seventy-seven. seventy-seven. it works. okay. now, if they're all mixed up, what we do is, we now, wh- what we'd do normally, um is you go out and you would catch a bunch of fish and you would mark them. you mark them in a number of ways. one way is to clip a fin. typically if it's a trout you would clip the adipose fin, or maybe a little piece of the dorsal fin or the anal fin. usually not, whi- or or the paired fins for that matter. uh you you take a clip out. and um, then you put the fish back. and, then, you come back on another occasion, say a day later a week later a year later or whatever, and you recapture a bunch of fishes. so now we go back and we'll start from the, other end of the class this time, you take a small handful, and what you do is you count the number that have been, uh you tot- count the total number that are in the um the total number that have been um, captu- recaptured the total number of yellow ones, and the numbers that were marked amongst those yellow ones. so now, we resample, the population, and we keep a total of the, the total, that we catch, and the number which are marked. plus, i- and the number that are marked. okay? so now what you need to do quite simply, um is to, count the totals and the numbers that are um that are marked. um and obviously when you recatch the fish if you're recapturing them you look for the number that are marked and uh and and so on. often, if you, go to a um_ if you're of the, boat dock stand round the lakes here, you'll find fishermen will bring in fish that are marked. and Petoskey there is frequently a D-N-R officer who is actually interviewing people about their fish, and checking to make sure they haven't exceeded the fishing limits, and uh they will give him the marks and so on, cuz a lot of fish are marked, and, you can mark fish in different ways. you know if you got fish from say if you're f- uh planting trout into the Great Lakes, and they've come from different hatcheries, different hatcheries may mark fish before they go into the water. and then they might recapture them, and they can get estimates of the survivorship of fish from different hatcheries. the survivorship of fish from hatcheries is pretty low. um, fish that are raised in hatcheries, haven't been raised in the hurly-burly, of the real world. so they typically tend to be not as good competitors, they tend to be much better as prey items from the sure five. five, and how many were samples? four. four. so (xx) okay i said a hundred. yeah, hundred. uh, what you're doing essentially is we know that, um, we know that, seventy-seven were marked. and we caught another, five, and we found that, um, five-fourths of these were marked. so if we multiply the original number by the proportion that are marked in the recapture. that is an estimate of how many fish there should have been in the entire population. cuz if we'd marked them all you see, this number would be five-over-five. um and if we mark very few, then um uh the- if we mark very few of the actual population then the number that are marked when we recapture is going to be very smaller and so on. so let's have some more numbers here. what if a bunch died in the interim? i'll_ let's get to the assumptions in a second okay? three and one. three and one. oh, that gives two hundred and thirty-one as our estimate. next ones? nop- three and two. three and two. that gives an estimate of one hundred and sixteen. two and zero. two and whoa zero. what does that give us? none. no it tells us that the population size is infinite, that we have an infinite number of M-and-Ms. i think i'm  uh six and three. six and three. hundred and fifty-four. three and two. three and two. uh four and one. four and one. ten and nine. ten and nine. uh one and one. one and_ one and one that's exactly seventy-seven isn't it? your indi- your, you indicate that every single fish in the_ that every single yellow M-and-M in the population was marked. Jody? one and five. one and five?  six and two. six and two. eight and four. eight and four. four and two. four and two. one and one. one and one. seven and four. seven and four. five and two. five and two. okay. so our numbers here, range from a population estimate of two hundred and thirty-one to seventy-seven. and this is a pretty simple situation. so it means the the average, the mean of our population size, the mean estimate is one hundred and sixty-seven yellow ones, but the standard deviation is eighty-nine. doesn't that just mean we have to do more samples? well, that's a good question. let's think of some of the assumptions now. first of all um, each one of these is an estimate of the population. it is considered that, if you have a minimum of seven, replica- sa- resamples, seven resamples, then you've got a good estimate of the population size. we have got substantially more than seven, and look at the variation. okay? now but what about the assumptions? the assumptions for a mark and recapture model were met in this experiment to the best of my knowledge. Michael said, what happens if there are some deaths? well if there are some deaths, then obviously if there is differential mortality, suppose clipping the fin is a stressor, that tends to give higher death rates of the clipped animals, um, you're going to get, wha- um, very sub- fairly substantial overestimates of the population size. and of course you are handling, those fish that you marked. now in your experience, what's the survival rate of a lot of the fish you handle? it depends. it depends on the species doesn't it? but if we get minnows on a hot day  yeah, um, okay so so tha- so if in the time period that we've looked at there's been differential mortality, then we'll get uh unusual population, numbers or i- inaccurate population numbers. and one of the assumptions of the method is that there is no differential mortality, and you know, from your experience, that that is sufficiently close to a load of hogwash as to be um, hogwash. what happens if there are births in the interim? (xx) how many were in there? i've no idea. oh there were a hundred and sixty-seven plus or minus eighty-nine... anyone, please don't eat the other ones. Phil wants to count them all later. 	1
LES405JG078.json	so, um, does everybody have a handout, for today? if not Aaron's got handouts f- also you'll probably need your handout, you will need your handout from, Thursday. and hopefully, the lecture'll be a little bit less painful for y'all to get through, and for me to get through than it was on Thursday. so, the point of today's lecture is to try to get into a little bit more of the nitty-gritty of plant, biotechnology. and um, it's it's such an odd, audience to try to, present this to because for some of you i know that you know the great_ all the details of the plant background and some of you know none of the details. so i'm trying to present more of an overview, of what the biotechnology process is. um, we'll start out talking a little bit about product development although not in great detail because, it just didn't seem like there was a whole lot of content that i could put there but i did try to give you some, numbers to give you a little bit of a feel for how much, plant biotechnology is going on and what impact it has on our life these days, and then, how one actually does gene transfer. we've decided on a product or in, in the case of your homework you have, an assignment to come up with a product. how do you get that gene into plants if that's your choice of how to do that particular homework assignment. and then, i'll talk about different ways in which one can get genes into plants to make a stable transformation. and then finally at the end of the lecture today i should have some time to talk about some of the very earliest, um commercial products that were, made from bi- plant biotechnology these_ there were some tomato fruit ripening, projects, and what happened to the first one and what happened to the second one. what was the, biology behind it so that you get some idea of what the, um, what they were doing at the time. so if you actually probably will need to start with your, handout from, Thursday, and about mm, i don't know, after, the phytoremediation part, there's a han- there's this page that looks kind of like this. are there any examples of, uh pests who have developed, ways of getting around the,  so what was problem with with picking them before they're ripe? problem was they got, um soft. so that they, they got softer than they wanted them to. and so, they weren't they just, they split. and they didn't expect that. i guess, i don't know. it just seems, to me that like picking them early wouldn't be that different than,  yeah well can't, can't they, expose them ethylene then after that? and if it do- that doesn't   okay they'd have to like have some sort of ethylene, sequestering (xx) well they ha- you know the tru- they have the trucks the trucks are specialized for ethylene production. oh yeah i heard that they used a, (bis toxins) to make sure they're flavored the right way. they made like, this, great tomato but then they used this but they used the wrong thing   maybe that was part of the problem then too, yeah. you know what? 	1
OFC355SU094.json	well first thing is i found that article. oh thank you. that was, seventy-nine i think. what year were you born? seventy-nine. that's what i thought. actually a lot of the research was done in seventy-nine, i've been noticing. like Reddy, wrote his article in seventy-nine. yeah that was the big metaphor, seventy-nine eighty. uh, when i wrote that, i had read a, a draft, one of many prepublication drafts of Lakoff and Johnson. and so i knew pretty much what was in it. but uh, book didn't come out until later. yeah. thank you. and, i found, an amazing amount of, has she gotten, recording levels? i think so. okay. alright. i found, one useful one from the web, most of 'em from the web were, um, there was something that was set up, as, a a conversational thing for, a linguistics class, and so it was just questions and replies oh i see. oh okay uhuh oh my word. yeah. wow. well, ask Jessica i guess. yeah. she said that she's not, that good?  the most exciting thing i found though... is this. it's Wong Scollon and Scollon this is from, Multilingua sixteen one, nineteen seven, ninety-seven. has a better re- theory theory place- replaced it now or? well... they weren't exactly looking at metaphor. they were, more looking for things that motivate cultures. okay. uh, like the root metaphors of fascism. that sort of thing. okay. she looked specifically at Cantonese and English metaphors, and then right. well she's got a m- a- a more modern sense of what metaphor means. okay okay. and so she said that a container metaphor, and a colonization metaphor, were the two primary metaphors in English. what was the first one? a- w- just the conduit metaphor the container metaphor. a- a- and  westward ho? yeah. ooh. that really does cling you know that uh, that resonates in a lot of different ways. i like that. ooh colonization. you get imperialism. you get hegemony. you get, you get the gender wars. you get... you get east west, north south. she also talks about the importance of creative development within the individual. creative development? right. but within the individual rather than, creative development of the entire network, of the entire social network which is what, the Cantonese metaphor is, which is the opposite, but she says that, uh, the American metaphor really focuses on, the very self-centered, creative development of the individual. and i think that works with the colonization idea too, because it's a very... it's the very small group of... yeah. it also suggests that the American view of the self, is, sort of takes the, mind body, difference wholeheartedly, and identifies with the mind it isn't integrated with the body. whereas the Chinese metaphor is integrated mhm the self has been colonized by, these individual containers, for, not necessarily for meaning but for aspects of the self, so, actually the American data that she has is from Carbaugh's, study on Donahue, yeah i think  okay she actually has an appendix at the back too of Chinese, proverbs uh m-  actually in the last part of that, of her metaphorical analysis of Chinese_ what? seven mouths eight tongue all talking at once. she says that school teachers say that to classrooms of children to make them be quiet. wow wonderful. Chinese are so earthy. and so she was saying that in contrast to, the American conduit metaphor that, the Chinese metaphor, um, holds a strict, importance on keeping what's inside inside, and keeping what's outside outside so and face in the middle. hm. okay. yeah. yeah exactly. hm. you seriously interested in China? yeah. i took the, Chuang Tzu course last,  oh? yeah, okay mhm okay. that was my first introduction to Eastern thought,  yeah. okay. uh, so, how does this fit in with your experiment? okay. i'm starting to realize that, metaphors of self, in, within the American framework and the Chinese, framework, have a lot to do with the metaphors for communication. and, that might be something that's, sort of inherent, just in the nature of communication but i thought it was an interesting, thing that, both, Wong Scollon and, um Carbaugh, who were studying communication, put such an emphasis on, the different cultural ideas of self. well, they're calling it self. uh the question is exactly which, variety of concept, they're talking about. there are a number, mhm  mhm i think it's interesting though that, as for my research the only part that really matters, is the socialized real- the socially realized conception, of self. so, what comes through in, social institutions. comes through? right. like  okay.  inner chapters and outer chapters and then, the extra, outer outer chapters that don't necessarily have anything to do with, specifically with,  no. and so, there's no- there really isn't that much of an importance placed on plot. there also isn't an importance placed on individual authorship. it's all called Chuang Tzu and, no one has really done all that much work to find out who, wrote the rest of it and it really doesn't matter.  hm'm well up to a point. ah there you get into, the, de re de dicto distinction. mhm okay... but what i think is interesting, is not necessarily, the de dicto de re distinction and, what actually matters, but what the different societies think matters. because yes yes, exactly. so, that's what i think is interesting in a concept of self. uhuh. yeah. i think that's right. uh, and we don't exactly ha- it's not like some things, it's not like metaphors for a number of, phenomena where we have physical reality to fall back on as something to reflect them off. but, nobody has any idea what self means if anything. except everybody has the idea that they're inside and everybody else is inside them, their their own, skulls or bodies or, persona or whatever. mhm see and that's interesting because the, something that Scollon said was that, um one of the really dominant, communication metaphors for Chinese is, of, bodily secretions so, the idea of the container is very porous that sounds so Chinese yep. and then one of the dominant metaphors for, English m- for American English metaphor, um is, more of a concrete container more of a house, doors and windows, box mhm  right and it seems like the important part is that they're within the social network. not that their one person,  sounds right. sounds right i mean something has to give, this incredible, strength to Chinese culture. i mean it's, minimum twenty-five hundred years old. and while it's been changed it's been changed real slowly and it's it's resilient, and it's tough as hell. just unbelievably successful. Roman culture isn't around anymore Greek culture isn't around anymore, old English culture isn't around anymore. Chinese culture is, just keeps on plugging. yeah. i know the philosopher. it's about  huh? sorry B A U D R no no, B A C H E, oh oops. then no, i don't know who he is. okay. i think he's an epistemologist or something. anyway this is this is uh, one of his side, ventures but he uh it's a hell of a book. it's about what all the different parts of the house mean. and the different rooms, and like closets are for keeping, keeping clothes which are roles, social roles, coming out of the closet, being in the closet, we have this repertoire of roles that we play in different uh circumstances mhm okay. alright so now we're were we including, Chinese on the yes. got a theory, yeah. but i still think that, actually, the interesting thing that i found from the, um Copernic search, was ooh  and this was written in Japanese, and all of the conduit metaphor information translates. right up to date. Turner and Fauconnier, blending my my.  say which? i've d- noticed that Aristotle is cited, in a lot of this research. oh have you read the Poetics? i've read some. that's about all that's necessary. a lot of it's about this meter for that stuff and that meter for this stuff and who gives a shit if you don't speak Greek you know yeah i think the best part about this, article, are the... is the... ooh oh yes. yes uh, this is a mhm. he plays a lot with that. uhuh this is a Fauconnier-Turner, thingy. okay. their stuff works pretty good the problem is that it's, so general that i can't see that there isn't anything that isn't a blend. okay. so the generic space generic space what? yeah? is that... actually there's a better, sorry to keep flipping the pages on you but mhm there. you have the input and output. uhuh uh... yeah. essentially that's where you store, that's where you s- you store common properties. okay. a little. what have you studied? C? actually i haven't, technically studied program, programming but, i have some outside knowledge of it so. you have? just some, knowledge of it from working with, the project   hm. okay. (xx) okay. yeah i've i've sat through lots of talk by um, by Mark and uh, uh, Giles, and, i think i understand what they're doing when i'm watching them do it, but then i go off and try to do it and i think why am i going to all this trouble? i mean what's it getting me? it looks more like, hand um, just from looking at this, at first, what i thought immediately was that it might have some... it might be a way to correlate, this, idea of the self, with, conversational metaphor. hm mm yes. yes i think that's right. that was how i thought  okay. not in this mhm of automobiles in general? o- yeah. i mean it it's you you can see the_ well it, may be a Svengalism but uh but it sort of works. anyway. oh, okay. so. what are you planning to do with this? okay. so. Chinese and Japanese. i also found, books about German and Spanish. about? about, metaphor in German and Spanish? ah, okay. so i have all four languages that i wanted to do at first covered. and, and and theories coming out every pore. yeah. alright. so i would like to, just stick with the those four languages. okay, uh, well, if you want, a suggestion of an Asian language that's accessible, and uh different, i'd recommend Malay or Indonesian. mm. okay. same language just different, different spoken in different countries. okay i actually have an uncle who speaks, Malay. so, he could help me with translation. yeah it's not hard. okay oh she's the other yes. that's right. okay. yeah. okay. uh, she's around now. but, uh she mi- i don't know, whether she's interested or not but she, she knows something about Malay. i know Malay, okay. alright. great. av- available by email it's a very uh very wired country. which brings us to the next point. i was talking to Jessica about, research methods. about? research methods, in general. and  yes and she suggested that, all of my participants, come from either, this country, or the countries where they speak, their native languages. so,  well no no no, i'm saying that, people who either, speak German and live in the United States, are native speakers of German who live in the United States, rather than, my native speakers of German coming from Switzerland and my natives speakers of Chinese coming from  exactly. okay. well that's true. on the other hand American culture, is our greatest export and it's  i'm not sure you can uh, you can control for that. i'm just i'm wondering if it would be, a confound in the experiment. i didn't explain that very well but what i mean is, should i have, non-native speakers who live here, or non-native speakers who live in their native countries? well, i would recommend that you choose one and not, not do both, cuz that way, if you, do do both you're introducing an uncontrolled variable. right okay. okay. yeah. if everybody talks the same it's boring. okay. no, no problem. okay. the only other thing, that i wanted to ask you about, uhuh you haven't? no okay so that task is still in the order of major framework first minor framework second, and then, i finished the paraphrasing task, but A B and C are always the same, role so A is always those'll be   thanks. thanks. Bs are all ambiguous. okay. getting getting into deeper waters here you know? mhm. alright fell.     i started out with that example, um, just as Mary, poured out her sorrows, but then i realized that i needed, some kind of a surface, uhuh uhuh  yeah, yeah. good. thanks. okay. the last thing that i was considering was a translation task. and i can see that as being something, very messy. yeah, i can too.  oh that's true. and then oh especially through email. huh?   okay. okay. okay. i feel like i've already done a pilot uhuh  but yeah it's changing enough that, uhuh yes. and i think this one's more sophisticated. so. yeah plus if you ask for a translation task, you're introducing, many more ideas, and, um, many more sort of, tasks that are going to stimulate other things. and that's gonna be very uncontrolled cuz free translation, is, quite uncontrollable. you've heard of, Pete Pete Becker tells that, when he does a web search on his name, at A-L Becker, he he finds that mostly he's referred to on the web in terms of, uh, uh Becker's demonstration, as it's now called. he didn't know it was now called that so he's, finding. which is, h- he he does it in classes and lectures sometimes to demonstrate exactly how variable, talk is. and he uh, the the bigger the audience the better. uh, he says i'm going to i'm going to do something i'll say start then i'll do something then i'll say stop. i want you all to pay very close attention to me and then i want you to write down what i did. and he says start and then he usually like walks up to a table and drops a book on the table and then says stop. and then they all write it down. and then they collect them. no two have ever been alike. think about it. that's, fascinating. yeah. yeah. and that's all in one language... there's something like that in a philosophy class with, describing_ the professor when he draws a square, up on the board, and the students have to describe, what he just did. yep. there you go.  right. okay. yeah. okay well i think i think we're clicking on enough epistemological ideas here. alright. so uh is this beginning to uh, to sound more like it might be a um, be or or become, a um, a thesis idea? yes. and okay  a two-part, thesis for, linguistics and philosophy. oh  i don't know, i've never, i've never really come across, a philosophical text with research, in it, and so  okay. well, um, there's no problem, from the linguistics side. we uh we steal philosophy all the time no problem. um, so i would guess find out from, the philosophy side, uh what they think about hm. and then, i was also considering, doing separate, doing something separate for each. and i'm not sure if i started that this summer because i won't be starting my philosophy thesis until winter.   yeah. okay... uh i'll start talking to, some people in the philosophy department mhm mhm. fi- find somebody that uh that you seem to click with that's interested in the ideas and that, that y- you're interested in their ideas and uh oh and i found the name of the new, professor of uhuh who? Stanley? from Cornell Scanlin no i- i haven't heard of that but it sounds like fun. okay. no Jason Stanley. Jason oh boy. uh, Jason Stanley. right. okay. there we go. uh, Jason Stanley okay i could do a web search and find out his publications. but um, probably be just as easy to wait till fall and uh, find  yeah. okay actually he's just teaching, the honors intro, for this fall. and then i think winter he'll start teaching more, upper level philosophy of language classes. okay is he uh, is he brand new P-H-D assistant professor or is he uh tenured? believe he's tenured. he,    definitely.  cool alright so, then, you got subjects? i have an idea of subjects. i'll start contacting the people who, the... girl i know who's living in Switzerland for the summer. now for Spanish, i have some contacts in Ecuador, and some in Bolivia let me see...  okay okay yeah well the last time, we had twelve native speakers of English and twelve non-native. and, we really only carried out the research for, a week and a half two weeks, um, since it was a group project and, we did have kinda short notice, we didn't really have the time, to get, that many, participants but, i think, the fact that in that short of an amount of time that many people replied, a lot of people replied the next day i think it's because email is, not invasive it gets there quickly mhm mhm. nobody can tell whether you've seen it and if you wanna ignore it you can ignore it and yeah. yeah. yeah. and i really_ i don't even know what to expect, for that. right. well, how many, you gotta have this statistically significant size, right? what kind of end are you looking for ideally in terms of responses? ideally? i would like, twenty-five from each group, and  okay... alright... aw that, doesn't seem that  i haven't looked at that yet. okay. um i did some psych research and used, S-P-S-S to find statistical significance, so i'm familiar, with it. i would like to take, Stats four-oh-two though,  okay. okay okay. i'll do that. then, next week same time? sure. okay. great. and  yeah. yeah. very good. it seems like i'll be able to get this out,  well you cert- you're certainly uh doing a nice literature search... oh. thank you. 	1
COL285MX038.json	um, here at the U-of-M, the Center for the Study of Higher and Secondary Education. congratulations. yes i decided i'd rather have this recorded than the defense just to gimme a little bit of (obviously) that's okay yeah that's it mhm did_ i was just wondering if_ i thought that you also did a survey of [Lakeview's] students? mhm. i did. i did. can you just tell us really, quickly about that? yeah. i would say first of all that the that the, res- it_ the report hasn't been written yet. it's it's in the... it's in draft form that just took second, you know, second place to the dissertation process but, i did it_ it was a um, a survey of all the graduate international students at the institution, where the where the case studies took place, and it ended up being a ce- uh census because the graduate school was willing to, pay for 'em to be sent out. we had a_ so there were about two thousand graduate international students and about five hundred responded, so a a decent response rate, but nothing overly impressive. how many responded? about five hundred. uh that's good   did they say that they were exploited at all   yeah right right. and i asked them about that because um, you know it's been a while since i looked at the questions specifically but i think i asked them, does your advisor expect you to do more work, than, the American students in the research group something to that effect mhm hmm i_ you had um site one i think fifty-four percent foreign-born faculty, but then in a previous one you had um, why should we, care  right.   right right um, a number of years ago somebody in one of our engineering uh departments talking about, the problem of, research jobs that did not allow uh, internationalists to, to be on the group at    hmm okay. i asked about that and what, i learned, that funding agencies will sometimes put pressure, on individual, faculty members, to have their research group be more heterogeneous or more balanced, more, leaning toward the domestic students. but it was, it was gonna be in our request for proposal, form if they had to have domestic students only and that was when_ when the federal government does that it's because of clearance required that has to be American. but those are rare. um especially at [Lakeview U or at Michigan,] i- they don't do hardly any classified, research so that wasn't an issue it was it was really more, subtle pressure that individuals from N-S-F or from uh the Air Force or something would would put on advisors to say you know, (your) balance (is) out. and it would_ they would talk about it uh in conferences or when they were giving updates, but it wasn't so much from corporations either they said the s- the proprietary issues_ i don't know i- for some reason it just wasn't an issue it was much more corporations, getting to the student they wanted to (xx) was there any um mention made of length of time for completion mhm you know i did not ask faculty about that so i couldn't ask that uh i couldn't answer that in this survey and and the didn't come up as an issue?  hmm if i put that in a more pragmatic sense, if you were somewhere in Asia, and a bunch of, people thinking of applying to an American university for a PhD came up to you, i think you would say_ i think you would recommend the university you're talking about mhm and it is just a guess because there's so little research about this but yes i think that among prestigious research (xx) universities this is this is fairly common and honestly i was surprised to find the extent to which faculty had individually thought about, issue related to international students, and had changed the way that they taught and advised them. that surprised me. whether i would recommend_ we we talked about this yesterday too um, there's social exchange theory, which suggests that, things work out in a balance and you typically, give as much as you feel like you're getting back in return. students come to a very prestigious research institution recognizing what they wanna get from it that their life will forever be changed. and, my guess is that besides cultural differences in terms of how they respond to people in authority and the whole power distance issue, i think that, what they recognize in order to get, my guess is that that has a lot to do with, whether they're_ whether they would be happy at this kind of an institution and whether they would (would) choose it. i think it's worth it i don't think the (treatment's_) from what i heard from faculty they don't (resent it.) i'm looking at the, i think uh the one the engineering department that you talked about as, the first one where the, population of international students was fifty-four percent or fifty-nine percent. that is on the outside the least supportive least accommodating  right yeah   yeah right   it just sort of seems to me then that this idea from the top down that students are seen as a threat or as a nonissue, that students are f- feeling that fully,  we uh_ i've heard faculty members, from engineering faculties, looking for domestic students because they're feeling pressure as a department from, parents government agencies domestic people why why don't we have American kids in engineering classes? why do have all these international students in (xx)  [At Lakeview,] they have teamed up at the college [level] and they have begun a very aggressive domestic recruiting plan for the past couple of years and the college is thrilled with the results they are bringing in a lot of domestic students so i'm guessing that the percentages will, probably have even changed for this academic year. so, i think_ besides_ you know the insulation because of their rank, that the fact they're being aggressive, they recognize that to be a top three department they really need a different balance, and so that's part of their overall strategic plan to increase the ranking but they they do want more domestic students, for a variety of reasons  i know  no but i thought you said it wasn't so prestigious for awhile so that they had no choice. no,    so they had a choice of taking domestic students and they made the choice of taking internationals? yeah w- they have decided uh_ and then and the first they'll be in a large cosmopolitan site has decided that they are actually going to find more international students in the first year which is a policy shift from from previous years, because they want the cream. and and there i had more than one person tell me this is uh th- th- the chair associate-chair level, we want the very best students and it doesn't matter to us where they come from, and we're willing to pay for 'em now we've decided that we're willing to to bring 'em in on funding. i think i've heard maybe about_ from faculty maybe in this larger site that you were talking about that the jobs are_ there are so many jobs available mhm mhm right oh yeah yeah   somebody_ i i quoted my dissertation from the other department they said you know if if we want more domestic students we should hope for a recession. i_ this was all graduate students   mhm but they've  yeah yeah i'd like to go back to the architecture  and they were the only department that actually considered providing some short-term support to students [as a result of the financial crisis overseas.] none of the other ones even considered it. i was  yeah. it it's_so, yes in an ideal world some of the leadership was telling me, this is what we're doing because we want to diversify. but a lot of you know others with more honest opinions saying oh you know we don't bring in, students from_ they they they have very few students from Latin America from Africa i mean, they have them primarily from Asia. th- which, their their recruiting overseas is just beginning and a lot of it's taking place in Asia. so they're not_ to give you a picture that they're really gonna be global in two years is is ridiculous they're not sorry. that's okay. (xx)  thanks very much. you're welcome. you're welcome. 	1
SEM300MU100.json	ugh, i hate this board. well it's cuz somebody, pulled it all the way down and it says, not to. yeah. turkeys. turkeys. is this all we get, three pages? there's more coming. i don't think we'll be doing it for three hours though. um, which is v- tentative, well let's say i predict that we'll be outta before, uh one o'clock. which is fine cuz i gotta take somebody to get a root canal anyway. ouch i hate that. did i tell you i g- i took in a cat, a stray cat? did i tell you this story? no um well you know it's not really a story, worth telling, until, this thing that happened yesterday. i'm not supposed to have, pets in my house, um so, i i kept worrying about the landlord coming by and you know the landlord doesn't, sneak on over and and try to catch you at things so i thought i'd be fine but, he left a message yesterday morning around ten saying that, he would be coming over to show my, my place to some people who wanna rent it for next year, and, if i had picked it up if i had picked up the phone then, uh i woulda been alright but i i was sleeping in so i didn't get the message until later when i woke up, about quarter to eleven, and, i had fifteen minutes to get, this place cleared of any cat, residence, uh   hm. yeah despite my not giving it any shots. or um getting it declawed or any of these things. which i kinda don't believe in. you know. the shots you don't believe in? i don't believe in the shots. you know? i i i    oh yeah?      if it's a matter of my getting the disease then i'll get it all the shots that it needs random  ohh. (you can have ink) did you not buy a pen for (the semester) (xx)  uh i'll probably repeat this later when more people show up. um, but write this down, for your sake, while it's still fresh, on my mind. uh comma splices, what are those? do you know? well you don't l- have to know what they're called i guess but, it's a run-on sentence. right? two sentences joined by a comma. uh they should be, separated into two separate sentences or you should do some sort of punctuation fix, um semicolon dash maybe even a colon, okay? Leslie you are a, big-time violator of the comma splice rule, and so is Erica (who's not here.) i thought i did better this time.  thank you very much Simon for announcing my uh, problem (in) class. yeah i can read you, some examples no that's alright, i'll read  hmm hmm? i thought it was the opposite. no no no no. so wait when we, when we put like Foucault page whatever, the period goes after the parenthesis right? or it goes inside the quotation? no no. that's not that's not a punctuation, Foucault whatever, you talking about a parenthetical citation? yeah do we put the, punctuation inside the parenthesis and put, a period, (at the end of?) um usually not. unless you need to cite the punctuation that, the author is using too. here. um... mhm what were you, what, no. um  uhuh. this stuff goes inside, unless you've got a citation to include in your sentence okay. of quotations? right. always? always. see that's totally new to me. are you sure?  okay what if the punctuation is in the quote? oh, if he, has used the punctuation? use it, and then it's stupid but you've gotta put a period at the end of it too,  (probably) (xx) oh no, this? show me. next one. next page.   ta da. isn't that nice? that is just great. don't copy it exactly cuz, that's not in footnote, footnote format.  wow   yeah he was hilarious.   he sat like right there. the one that was really like, gung ho oh Justin yeah. was that his      he was very entertaining. yeah. yeah.   yeah (xx) he'd walk in, sorry i'm late and he'd say hi whenever (we) walked  yeah. okay. i think he played like tuba or something something (that's loud)  oh. i think that hmm. didn't he tell us that?   yeah okay okay um, look at this long paragraph, in the middle, um i'm... this is this is gonna g- it's gonna sound stupid but i like long paragraphs. um i like long paragraphs because if, there's a good reason for its length, um it means that the student is on to something or is willing to, to, think this through. it's a better sign than you know short paragraphs that, um, are not transitioning well between, one to the next. i want you to uh look over this paragraph with me, and uh we're looking for just uh style here, right because the language here i thought was pretty tight. um although there are some co- co- corrections that i would make but when it's on i thought um it was it was on. bless you. mhm bless you thank you.  thanks uh, not really. okay. i don't know if there's (anything) (xx) did you were you able to do a draft for the previous paper? yeah. okay um, i should've liked to ask Chris uh Eric that too. um, okay. let's do Chris's. the right one? yeah yeah, okay. okay. what do you think? um it's, to the point. it's clear.   hm? how? um, well the at least the ones that he calls panoptic  and then he could talk about m- how they're invalid. yeah. Chris do you really mean that all morals of all Christian morals are panoptic and dangerous? no. (maybe talk about) the ones you mean, s- more specifically? i mean  many   maybe you mean   no. okay. yeah i think  oh okay, okay.  i guess well there's two_ well the sentence right there there's the two parts, it's valid and it's invalid and then the next two paragraphs one explains why it's valid and the next one, explains why it, okay   oh, that is long   how do you do that? well, um, you can do it, you know, the easiest way to do it would be, um, there are two ways to explain this phenomenon or there are two sides to this story end paragraph next paragraph. okay   right. okay? um, you need to footnote that, right? or you should, first time you're   block quotes? block yeah. just at the end of the block. okay yeah. is that your, was that your  oh i was just gonna say like, would you just, like have the footnote at the end of the block and still have Hammer underneath it like the way he has there, no right you wouldn't have that at all. right, one, but not both. right? just like, just like you wouldn't i just didn't know if it worked different with the block or not. mhm. okay? Sarah?  oh or any of you, this isn't just, Sarah's paragraph... um, just, like, for the sentence that says, have a relationship with God and that he always is watching us, would you say he is always watching us? is it... where should you put the always? oh say again? which sentence? it's between the first and,   yeah. (i thought it should be that.) i like it.  is that fair to use eye like that? cuz, i don't know, i don't know fair? yeah fair like it's a, thing, from the book that, isn't explained at all but, kind of assume that (it's) uh hm... maybe you should footnote that, actually. okay. yeah. good. and you can get that um, get that footnote out of the way too. question about that one. would you like if he's footnoting that would he like, give a, a definition of what that eye is in Atwood at in the footnote? you know how like,  yeah h- how would you do it would you put that before like all the information or after the information? after. okay. i don't see anything terribly wrong with it. no it looks good to me too. yeah i like this idea immensely. um i don't know why i didn't thought uh why i didn't think about this before. alright? um faith i think here is the, is the right word. alright? w- you were talking about, the relationship between, the panoptic inmate and the guard, the unseen guard right? that relationship is one of faith. it's a perversion of faith but you know it's it's it's the same thing it's, not, it's believing in something that you don't see or you have no proof of. right? right so, maybe um not a big mistake or an accident that, Christian fundamentalists um, well a theocracy like Gilead, operates, under uh panoptic rules. good good good. next one? Jenny?  mhm. oops what what? stick with one verses. S E S not S U S.  yeah. oh  that one too mm? (well) it sounds like (you know) the Bible pretty well. um, you used aloud oh where? um in the second sentence oh yeah yeah. that's a good contribution (xx)    just cuz it says Bible twice (in there?)   yeah.  (xx) yeah i know. i have a like, i have a question about that in general like, repeating the same word in a sentence is that like always bad or is it okay sometimes? uh well, it's it's never bad. right? it's not a bad like  like in the sentence, in the, paragraph before, this one he uses consequence, twice but it doesn't seem like it, interrupts like the flow of the sentence or anything. mm. um, okay i'll i'll give you this, this to you, in terms of kind of what's better and what's worse, cuz of it's not really a rule, um, what would be what would be bad or towards bad, is um, both using a word, the same wo- word more than once when you don't need to and also you can hear, that word being reported repeated, and so it distracts you. okay? better than that would be repeating a word, um but it doesn't really_ you don't really hear it, like the consequence one, which i didn't catch either. um, better than that would be not repeating the word at all, and better than that would be um using words that really, make the subtle distinction between ideas if, there exists such a a distinction and and it's it's uh relevant to what you're talking about. repeat words if you're if you mean it if that if that has a point. okay? maybe the first time you use that word, you use it in one way and you mean for the reader to understand it and the second time you mean it there's a second aspect to that word, that you mean in, in that part of the sentence. right? but you know those scarce_ cases are rare, um, so otherwise it's it's usually just uh um, you know laziness of of writing, right of of writing drafts. um you didn't feel like taking out a thesaurus at that moment or you just wanted to get that idea down on the page before you forgot it or something. alright? um, so fix it between drafts. um, good. you have anything to say about what Chris is talking about here? when he says that um, i don't remember what it was about her use of the scriptures being ridiculous? um, hold on i gotta find it. ridiculous amount of focus on this topic. yeah. it doesn't, i don't_ like the statement doesn't seem to be really like proved afterwards how it is ridiculous like, because like there are like a lot of, people who still use the Old Testament, you know, like uhuh okay. the Old Testament like, ideally like, was supposed to be, you know the, like Christian Scientists or like, churches like that, only use the Old Testament so like, it seems like right yeah that's good. uh maybe you want to, say that you think this is ridiculous because, well um it's it's a convenient use of, it's a convenient um, taking out of context of certain passages, right that might, be proma- uh problematized by other parts of the Bible. right? i think you're you're getting at that you're_ that's why you're saying they don't talk about Jesus. also because like there's scriptures in the New Testament that also like in, Thessalonians and Phillipians it,  hm i remember in the movie they, they um... during this sa- the ceremony during the Prevaganza, um, the guy, right this is when they get their veils, right? the guy says we'll let the the Old Testament be our guide, or be our constitution or something like that, i don't think there's anything like that in the book, right? any, you know uh, proof that this that Gilead is only listening to the Old Testament. right but i i do remember that from the movie. do y- i was looking for_ do you know the Bible very well? huh? i was looking for_ i don't know if it would actually help my paper at all but there's a verse, that talks about, women bearing children, because of, um, Eve's original sin?     well it's it's right in Genesis isn't it? um, (i don't know,) i don't know. yeah when they're getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden, mhm that_ it says, (xx) yeah it's right there.     oh okay. what about the trope of um, of one being, bride to Jesus? what's that? or one being bride to Jesus one, one marrying the church? what about that? are you familiar with that? you know there is there is and the the the reason why nuns don't,  i don't know you might get into a whole mess though   i have another, yeah  do they really refer to being like, the fruit as being you mean like this, specific? i was talking yeah   yeah oh okay. okay you wanna do the next one? okay? Matt i think that's yours. um, criticize. criticize the church. hm? yeah. be sincere...? is enst-   um, what do you think Matt? um... who was the Sunday Christian in Huck Finn? i don't remember he goes t- i don't (xx) i don't really like that second sentence. he ends up with this fa- it's the Romeo and Juliet thing where, they have the two families who are, oh yeah okay, okay. um, hmm... go on Matt. i didn't mean to interrupt. um i just, i didn't like that second sentence. you didn't like the second sentence? what's wrong with it? um... i don't know he's saying, that the Christian is two-faced and hypocritical or   the Christians. oh yeah right. yeah it's, (xx) yeah uh right now it reads that the portrayal is two-faced, portrayal are two-faced so that doesn't make sense, um, of the two-faced Sunday Christians, right? you need something like that. uh i think that's a dead end, Matt uh Chris. yeah. yeah i think so. okay. yeah take it out.  you're saying that Atwood is a    no both their, they're both, for the sake of popularity i think they, made_ didn't make_ even though they both opposed Christianity, they don't, make a direct attack on it i guess. okay. okay, for the sake of, um, for the sake of moderation, uh, nonoffensive? i don't think that's a word. right i don't think so either. i couldn't think of a better one though. well, you can say inoffensive but, i think you just mean, isn't, offensive, right? yeah. that still isn't offensive to a large Christian audience...  mm, can you say something about it Amy? well it's the wrong whether, the first senten-  fundamentalists needs an S on the end yeah yeah you guys  Chris coulda done that on his own. yeah one thing like the about the historical notes at the end of the novel (at) this part and then it says the entire historical notes at the end of the novel is that bad that it just like kinda repeats itself a little like that? what? what's that? like where it says but the historical notes at the end of the novel, and then it says the entire historical notes at the end of the novel like you know that one part sort of (in quotes?) or, could you just have the first part different so it doesn't just, hm. and, is this, is the descrip- this description of Gilead could in fact be a description of our American society but i yadda yadda yadda is that a run-on sentence sort of? where are you? or no? right after the first, um, block quote or this description of Gilead or is there does there need to be a comma there? this description of Gilead could in fact be a description? doesn't there not need to be a comma after Gilead? no comma. right. and after here in the next sentence shouldn't there be a comma? after here...? oh. um, your choice... when he said, he believes that, it lacks a certain bit of skillfulness yeah what does that   who lacks the skillfulness? what   yeah, sort of. um, so you're d- you're disagreeing with Malak on that point, and you're going on to disagree with him about, what he says, about the historical notes too? j- i'll just tell you what i mean cuz in the next par- the next paragraph talks about um, her uh, satire here is that the, historians are looking at, the situation in a very unemotional, unrelated way, mhm  well that's what i said and then, seeing as that At- Atwood's, satire is on, Christianity that is, describing her view of how a, like an_ i don't know i don't think i can explain it. Atwood is satirizing, uh a hypocritical, interpretation of the Bible, right for the purposes of establishing a theocracy that, is really just about power. okay? so if she's satirizing that, then y- you imagine that she is for the kind of spiritual reading of the Bible that you're, you're saying bl- is missing in Gilead right? i suppose sorry,   i could make a lifeline joke but i'll, pass.  are y- are you saying that Offred, are you saying the Atwood is satirizing, spirituality or, an unspiritual hypocritical way of, interpreting the Bible? um i'm saying kinda both. both?  (seem) to lose it myself.   yeah who is that Jenny? me alright oh funda- fundamentalism. yeah.  i think that's pretty clear. okay. um, can you fault her for this? can Atwood be faulted for, not considering, um Christians who are subjecting themselves to persecution in an attempt to serve God? i thought about that too and i- i guess it go_ in uh, i think Malak's, because he talks about how, like Gilead is fictional in certain ways, and how it's okay to be fictional, that, and if you had these kind of Christians it would kinda ruin the the whole point of it. yeah it would ruin  well in the, there's no_ in Gilead there's no one who actually, none of the characters actually believe, in what's_ in the system, you don't think? what about Aunt Lydia? um... i think she's the test. what's that? i think she's the test she seems to be the, the  well she seems to, it gives her power to be a, to, you know like a preacher who, like a televangelist who's trying to get money    i think the reason why this particular paragraph to me, well, if you probably in this essay address the other people too, and could show how you could make a strong argument talking about the people who, do use the Old Testament and the people who don't, then maybe, it would be easier to prove that  (like)   yeah. that's what you need. um, you know what though, and this is kind of a lame concern, but uh, you're straying from the paper topic too. right? you had me when you were talking about how Christianity is already necessarily panoptic, right, cuz i'm thinking wow he's talking about Foucault. i didn't think anybody would. i was thinking that. okay uh, take a break. just a little one (xx) i know, i'm  i know i'm kinda jealous. but you know what just ticks me off though? cuz now i have all these like, great ideas? i don't know he said you know it just wasn't he said your arguments are not clear like things weren't and i said oh that's really bizarre,            well that really makes me feel bad oh no oh my god. did you piss him off or something? no we got along super well.  i i don't know    well see   well it's totally different. well as far as quality is concerned well, the thing i- i don't know i thought they were the kind of the same number one, Buddhism and, you know Chinese philosophy, are a little different_ ah the philosophy was like a little obs- obscure to me. like uh the Chinese philosophy was just kind of what are you what are you, Taoism? Confucianism? yeah. all of it. like i just  who were the other people in    every single time i'd sit down i would be like, start writing a paper i would freak out and my boyfriend has to like, convince me that i can get through school. oh oh i could   yeah you are this not this part? are we?   oh. yeah i think you're doing okay not really you won't get graded don't worry i know. D minus. tell me, go go around the room one more time and tell me what you guys are studying. music, viola. general studies, anthro religion and soc. computer science. architecture. psychology and religion. education. psychology and film video. haven't decided yet. i don't know. you do a lot of writing Amy, i bet. i guess. not not as much as you'd think like psych classes they give you like one, two papers   they're not that bad really wait, did we already talk about if you were in two-oh-one last semester? what religion? yeah. um i was in it for first semester last year yeah they don't offer it second semester. with wait (i get the professor) that was like    (was his name) Jackson? i don't know their names i really i went to lecture probably two thirds of the time but i don't (know their names) oh my god i was, laughing so hard half the time i was so, the problem with Ralph Williams is that i was so intrigued by you know his,  he stresses the wrong words in  what is this, what is this way you have, of using the word stress? i've caught it i've caught caught this particular usage am- among this group. you yeah     yeah yeah, whenever  yeah,  well that's more interesting actually. that's funny. i'm stressed. i like Collins a lot. huh?  wait, were you guys in witchcraft? yeah yeah  witchcraft?  i learned so much in that class       oh that's cool it was   i only take random classes yeah you had_ didn't you love our G-S-I wasn't she the funniest thing? (Malgosia?) i know  did you have Gloria? huh? did you have Gloria? Malgosia oh wait, which is the one with the big hoops?   did she have real short hair? yeah yeah okay no, i was thinking of Glor- Gloria's the one that's, the (fruitcake.) oh, i know no i never (xx) i was so, i had a (xx) oh that guy. that guy pretended like he'd really like read up and like do background work cuz he's a classical (studies) that he knew all     i think Malgosia hooked me up a little bit i don't know i think i did re- i did really w- that's probably the best th- i've ever done in any class. really? mhm did you keep up with the reading? uh, out of like out i don't know the twenty-five hundred i read about, like, twenty-five pages,     essentially  i know,     th- yeah that's pretty much   that's how he ends every uh,     and   uhuh   yeah it's very f- weird. should avoid that if you can. yeah i didn't know i was like a freshman when it like occurred. i went to a one of the conductor's, houses to play for his wife's birthday party or something and, he started drinking and he just like yeah yeah your audition was good but, what were you doing when you blah blah blah and like yeah you barely got in the uh orchestra and, you know what do you play and what are you majoring in? viola performance. oh by any- do you know Betsy Williams?  oh  no. she's one of my roommates. i don't know any (these) people who are the vocalists cuz they're all like, in their own world.    really?   seriously? oh the string players? well like the brass people are like gross and like, gross and yucky they're like, definitely (good.) the musical theater people ra- people are like totally dramatic and like,   (it's okay) (xx) (at my high school) there were lots of gay guys. and they don't- you don't usually cross over like, you don't find too many string players being friends with like brass people or like, vocalists  you make it sound like they carry their instruments around all over the place. no but like i mean you play with people like in string quartets and stuff and, like even in orchestra you like s- like the brass people are way back there like making jokes, while like the string people like have to be on their best behavior     okay... are we still talking about this (xx) yeah we've still got, oh uh we up to, Amy did you go? yeah i went okay. Chris why don't you, go ahead. no reason why you shouldn't, examine your own paper.  L-E-D yeah um it's it's surprisingly appropriate   you see what i mean? yeah, i saw it. sorry, sorry  mhm what do you think of that? where it says, um  um, in like, probably like, oh right above the kink yeah right above the kink it says,  just how do you feel sympathy towards mistreatment, like, mistreatment isn't the thing they feel sympathy towards, don't they feel sympathy towards her, Janine? oh (xx) because of the mistreatment she gets, she gets led into? yeah. thank you. right... okay so we have, we have Offred... and you say that she has characteristics, of a godly Christian woman, she is independent enough, but never strong enough to act on her own will without the aid or suggestion of someone else. is that a characteristic of a, Christian woman? is that an ideal? i don't i'm trying to say that she's not, um... i think some of_ i don't know if it's worded (right or) yeah the maybe the wording is um... yeah it's it's misleading. i see what you're_ you're saying that she's not, passive, but she's not, mm she's not a leader. well you're saying,  and that's, a Christian ideal? i don't know is this like a, according to you or according to,  i think if you're gonna characterize Offred that way, um it's going to be hard to call her an ideal Christian woman. right? if you're saying that she has all these, thoughts, and we know that she has all these thoughts about escaping and whatever, but then you say that because she doesn't act out on those thoughts sh- that makes her, that makes her Christian? it doesn't make her Christian but, for, like, um, for it's a, feminist novel and you you would expect that the, main character would be much more, independent than, right uhuh. oh okay right  right. i think she's, saying that Off- like that's, she fits into... i guess it goes (on) with this thought too that the Bible describes, it doesn't give a description of ma- mi- mu- women being equal, but um different in, where the male is the leader, and the woman is, like um, like that a w- i don't know, i just thought, the next paragraph kind of explains it  refined? refined   right exactly like, maybe she's not ex- like what a Christian woman should be but more so like the ideal of what a Christian woman should be. do you know   i don't know like she's like, when people look at her, you know her actions show someone who's, what a Christian woman should be. but don't they want  i'm saying the Bible_ well the Bible doesn't say like men should be this way and women should be this way it kinda is, like i say this later that um, it's saying God created man this way and women created, women, this way,  i think  i i see what you're i see what you're getting at but we're continuing the same problem of your paper, uh going down, a related but um, well i thought this i thought this actually was  huh? i thought this was a relevant path.  yeah you you are getting to that. right? but you're answering it, you know, your criteria for heroism, um is leading this discussion, in a way that, mm, it's taking you further and further away from Foucault i'd say. okay? yeah. yeah. why? because she's not trying to fight um, she's not opposing, the power. what is the, what is the goal? what is the dream of a panoptic hierarchy? it's, to have discipline, over the people. uhuh   right right. that's it. right? on one on in one sense she doesn- Janine doesn't have to be watched, at all, okay because, she's always being watched, inside. um Moira, right, Moira is the opposite... um i think you're going_ y- you might wanna, you might wanna talk about this difference, in that way just so you're starting to, to tip this discussion back toward where we want it. mkay? um, you can do this you can talk about_ if you can carry up until this point in the in the essay, um, both your point, that this is a panoptic society and that panoptic societies are easily translatable into Christian societies, then talking about Christianity here and how, Offred is God godly, and others aren't, would make sense still, right? it i- you still wouldn't be outside of the realm of discussion that i want you to be in. okay? but if you're not if you're gonna lose Foucault all the way, like completely, um then it needs to be corrected. okay? and i think you sh- i think you should, carry, up until this point your your thesis that, um that faith in Christianity is like the faith of, a panoptic, uh system, the faith of, the faith in the panoptic power.... right? both higher powers both both are higher powers both involve, uh a certain giving up of yourself, right? both involve, faith, both involve higher purpose, right. other notes, about this paragraph...? next one, Cliff? alright... one word when you say natural do you mean the same thing as, as Christian?  yeah. yeah how so? um, well he's a stereotypical, like, um... savior? yeah i guess well because she finds safety in him, and that's a Christian thing that, men provide safety for women. i don't think there's overlooking the fact that there's animal lust, involved okay (xx) maybe you're you're looking   i mean the the way you say animal lust but it is, like the whole thing with like Moira being gay is kind of, interesting i think like, cuz it's not, cuz she's totally throwing away these ideas that women should do  mhm hm right so for Moira there is no, yeah right. do you do you remember how, Moira fails to, enlist the cooperation of men? okay? there is a certain suggestion about, uh Moira that because she is not attracted to men she doesn't have an avenue for, deliverance the way Offred does. right? she can't be saved by men the way Offred can be saved (by men.) i like that, and i like the stuff about Nick and, her relationship to Nick, versus her relationship to the Commander, because, you can do a good comparison of, um, you can do a com- good comparison between what you say here and what Hammer says, of that love triangle. okay? but right now i think you're really starting to see that the discussion is it has strayed, um from points that it w- that we wanted to cross. right? and now we're talking, almost purely about you know, Christian faith and and Christian ideals. um, did you notice, do you notice that when you read aloud sentences, you can catch, the awkwardness, um more easily than you could just reading it silently? right?  what do you think? i like the paragraph, (xx) pretty straightforward? mhm  uh let's do this one first... what are you doing with the, with the quotation marks there what's that about? um oh, i see   yeah okay yeah. and then that one should be, never mind what? i was gonna say no no no oh what were you gonna say? um, never min- i was just thinking that that could be footnoted but, i ah  the paper is doing what drafts normally do towards the end, okay? it kind of, it's it's picking up loose stuff that you, forgot about during the discussion or, the rest of your notes, and kind of putting them together, in like a scramble paragraph. okay? it's uh, right, it's it's stir-fry it's you know leftover delights um, massive discipline, does that make sense? massive discipline i don't know how discipline could be massive, (xx) yeah, you're right. and uh,  yeah. um it says yeah right or yeah. i liked the idea that even those at the higher end of the system don't seem to enjoy their lives.  yeah. right. it's it's telling, it's telling that, at at_ the higher up the, the power, system you go, um the more violations that you have right? the Commander is, you know is lustful is, you know all these things that a Christian, shouldn't be even in Gilead. um, right but he's he's still not happy. i don't know if he's unhappy the way the same way that the Handmaids are unhappy but, yeah nobody's really happy here... degenerating to the citizens is a weird way of saying something. right d- degenerate, you don't degenerate to, right? the thing itself degenerates but you don't degenerate to anything. or you can degenerate into something else but, you know it's it's not a, it's not an affecting, uh action. you see? um i'll do the last one i guess.  it's a rough draft. i like that  kink hoopla this will all be explained in the next draft.   (think it's right) right effects. right. mm mm pssht  it's just out there that was good. yeah, i know. yeah it's good but you know that, yeah. um you need to work on style. okay? uh sentences are, a bit clunky, um, transitions are missing, um paragraph order could be rethought right? all this stuff that you're supposed to expect and, address. it was good though. okay let me give you back your papers and some leftover quizzes and things and let me have you fill out evaluations. (xx) what are you trying to do i was gonna give it back and then i'm (steal) (xx) do you guys want a copy of this? sure yeah  yeah. there's a (transcript) Chris is going no do we need to use pencils for the evaluation? yeah you gotta use pencils. do you have some?   i hope it's nice out. i know you can't tell in here      i ju- i just looked up i saw blue sky. blue sky and clouds. how long have you been teaching this class? this is my fourth time teaching comp, one-twenty-five, and i've taught creative writing before. did Chrissy leave? wow, cool. uhuh yeah (xx) it's nice, i enjoy it. hey since you guys don't need it anymore can somebody spare a syllabus?  	1

Janine Ovens, this is a this is a kind of an introduction to theories of ar- of art in the Renaissance. whoops. i'm like where's my new folder? and we've been doing_ we've been talking about each individual, medium, we've done painting we've done graphics  no  (you really wish that we could) oh no, what? holy Moses. (what is this?) what'd you do Beth? i thought, i forgot (some slides) bye Beth bye. alright, now, okay so today we're going to talk about sculp- ture and unfortunately as i said we have to use slides we can't be in front of the objects, but we do have some nice slides so, it's not gonna be too bad. and hopefully you've done, although i know it's midterm week so my guess is you haven't done your reading from Taylor is that right? i did it all like two weeks ago. who's done the reading from Taylor? i read part of it. i read it all of it, like last week i've read stuff but i, didn't read Taylor. (not) the right one. so how are you finding Taylor anyway? um, subpar. what? sub par. sub far? par. sub par hard? par, like golf. sub par oh oh under par. mkay, yeah no he's not a thrilling writer i would say. but it's very useful information and i don't know of another one that does that. yeah. well the best part is that list in the back.  yeah that is nice that is nice. and the, art. i agree. alright. you were all making so much noise about, wanting some of this grapefruit it was mostly me and him. we don't want all that mess. you all this is the grapefruit class. Zack was too. what? you said you wanted some. no, i don't want any. i said it was a bad addiction that he was getting into. oh i'll take the rest of it. no, come on. okay. this is, a one, characteristic of sculpture that is completely different from any other media we've had so far, is kind of illustrated on the screen. do you know what that is? different perspectives? three dimensionality? say that again. being able to see it from, various perspectives. yeah. but you have to see, yeah, it's three dimensional. and the thing is that with a three dimensional object, that alters your analysis of it considerably and that really, makes it a bit, it's a huge difference in the way you approach sculpture than, the way you approach painting or graphic architec- um, or the, or the graphic arts. we're really moving into the, into the round, and in order really to deal with sculpture you have to be able to see it from all the angles that it's meant to be seen from. which means um, that your analysis it's it kind of compounds the problem, y- you look at it from the front but then, you really have only done half of it, um, you gotta go around the back, and take a look at what is there, unless the sculpture is frontally, meant to be frontal and frontally placed. now, early, most of the sculpture that we, looked at in the in the Greek peri- in the ancient period when i showed you the Parthenon sculptures, were actually meant to be seen only from the front. but things like the Venus of Willendorf, which is actually held in the hand is meant to be not only seen, from all angles but handled. you know what i mean? so you have to really take that into consideration. i'm just showing you one, classical example you should have this sh- that's shown in every art history class or i think you do, Katie have you seen this yet? i think so, but this is the Rape of the S- this is you- n- the second part of your midterm. O G N A Bologna like, not like baloney but like it's spelled the same way. that's what it that's,  same way. B O L O G N A i thought you spelled baloney in a in American B A L O N E Y?    and the the name of the piece is the name of the piece is, The Rape of the Sabines, and it's um... Greek? is it Greek? Greek.  Roman. Roman. it's Roman, yeah. it's it's an ancient um Roman top- um ancient Roman subject, it actually is a historical event. um, in which uh two tribes, one of which, was called the Sabines and i don't know what the other one was called, bless you. that was a cough, thanks though. well look how they're dressed. what? i said well look how they're dressed, they were asking for it. they're not wearing any clothes. what? are you just trying to start a fire? yeah he's just trying to start a little thingy. yeah, yeah be quiet. but she's naked okay. alright. so th- but the but we're not actually going to concentrate on this because we don't have that many good slides of it. um, and it's but what's important about it again is that if you, here's the f- here's the back view and here's the front view and you really can't tell what's going on, until you've actually (circumviewed) the sculpture. here's um, a Sabine woman being taken away by the attacking tribe and a Sabine man being pushed down, um, by the attacker weak effort right there yeah what? don't alright. so the point is the point i just wanna make is that that that always, you n- the first thing you need to think about is to look at it from multiple, um angles. okay, um, now we're gonna go on and talk about the materials of sculpture, and again remember when we talked about painting we divided, it into water based paint and oil based, um pigment oil mixed pigment, we're gonna divide sculpture equally into these two huge categories. um, one is what um, Taylor calls, um additive, that is sculpture that's made up with a building up of forms so additive, A D D I T I V E, and the other is...? subtractive excellent. no that's  no let's  okay. okay. do you have a knife (that i can cut it?) i was just doing it with (my) (xx) it's like everybody's got a pen out but nobody has paper. now it's gonna take you a while to figure this out but look at it there are two different views of something is that, Poseidon? look at, look at it carefully. what? oh Boboli i was gonna ask the medium.  temporal i'm not sure. i bet you t- i bet i bet you were right. try it. i was gonna say when you paint on the wall, but i just forgot what it was called. yeah it could be like fres- it could be like fresco, which Taylor talks about in a way, but try something else it's even more it's even more analogous. remember what we just saw? printing? the engraving, stone? the etching stuff? yeah engraving the etchings, well but even more if you're cutting away something. wood cuts.   yeah, i did and you can see the (xx) and you can you can see and see and see the two different ones actually there are a bunch of different kinds. do you see? this is one, right here, see all those little uh, thingys, those lines? right. yeah and look at look at these little lines right here. see the little, all that stuff? what did he use for that? there are all sorts of different tools and Taylor, um ge- illustrates them actually. he shows you all the different tools, in his book, and how, it's handled. but, you know you realize that you have to have this incredible combination of, strength, and delicacy. you know what i mean? you've gotta have the kind of um, the the the attention to det- you have to have the attention to detail that you saw in that Durer engraving but the power, you know of a of a of a you know a bull? doesn't look like Michelangelo (xx) Michelangelo why was this left unfinished? what? did he die or? same reas- it was left unfinished for the same reason. was it just unrealistic? what? it doesn't look like his regular stuff. this was going to be for the tomb of, um Julius, yeah. yeah that's cool. some of these were calculated okay, um, but but Julius did not want to um, Julius, decide or decided that he would abandon work on the tomb for a while and he set Michelangelo to painting the Sistine ceiling. Michelangelo really wanted to finish this thing. he likes carving much better than painting, but he got stuck for forty-eight doing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. so, here again you can get it can you see the detail here? mhm you know, it's in Rome (xx) hm, no that wasn't what i was thinking of. (xx) this is um, The Pieta of Michelangelo. which is um, spelled. P I E T A. and it's one of the standard subjects like the flagellation (put.) do you know what that means? yes. do you know what that means? i mean, not th- i mean do you know what that means? it means mercy. yes it means mercy, that's right, or pity. i just learned that yesterday. let's see, okay. so it's the Pieta. Beth, is that one in Florence also? that's true. that is true. yeah. here's the face of the Virgin, of the Virgin Mary, and let's, put it up against the face, of the Boboli slave... so that you can see what the Boboli slave would've looked like if it had been finished. now probably he wouldn't have had as refined a surface um, for a for a, a male, slave figure as he does for the Virgin Mary, but it would be pretty close. but you can see now and what i'd like you to do is come up really close and look at the um, look at the surface of this. you can see that he's really gotten to the point, where i- you you almost can't see it but if you get in close you can see you can still see the texture, you can see the tools at work. from a distance it's hard for you to see, but if you come up close you can see that, um but you can also see the incredible, detail that he gets. look at her, when you get up here look at the eyelids, they're really extraordinary. look at the, um the fold in the lip, look at the bones underneath the um, the neck and the collarbone, where he gives you the suggestion of of bones underneath the flesh, look at the folds of the cloak around her how, with and remember this is marble right? this is material that's like this, where you really to, you're sti- you know you're still working really hard, um, and yet he gets, a sense of cloth, the texture of cloth, the folds of the cloth, it's really a stunning, performance. this is like, you know this is like Durer on the Melancholia this is really an amazing, guy. um, who's not a bad painter too. so why don't you come on up and again take, get in real clo- i mean stand on the side don't stand in front of the light, but so that you can see um, the the texture because it's there, it's there you can see the stone there... i know she's gonna (xx) (xx) what is that? and then compare it with this. (xx) what happens? can you see it if you, don't yeah don't stand in front of the light. that's okay you just have to stand to the side if you can. right. right. can you see what i'm talking about it? this um, can you see the c- actually i can even see it from here, but you kinda have to get in there. i'd go sit on the floor over (xx) (xx) and that's not just the screen? yeah, are you sure that's not just the screen? yeah no it's not the screen. maybe it's the f- photo. it could be the photo but i don't think so. cuz look they they're different. you know what i mean? they're slightly different. but look how he suggests her eyebrows, (xx) why is there a line (xx) i think that's supposed to be the, a band a suggestion of a, um a band oh, okay. that's not gonna be good. is there a (graph) on the end? no. then that's just the s- yeah that's the (skull) now do you notice what happened with the Pieta uh um, not long well not long a- probably a long time ago now, eight ten years ago? someone walked into Saint Peter's where it is now in the Vatican, um and had a hammer ooh, no. why? i don't know. people are stupid and do things like that. just the foot?   (xx) beautiful people (xx) you know? some people are like psycho you know? yeah it is psycho. so looks like a swashbuckler. and again notice the area around the neck and this time take a look at the um, at the hair. the detail in the hair, and again the eyebrows and Christ has a little, goatee... you know get i- in even closer, here's the left hand of the Virgin... and there you can see the joint, to a um, there is a part that he had to kind of um solder on, i don- not solder on i don't know how they did it they probably had some kind of a strut  a piece of metal. they drill a   is that the only piece that one thumb, is the only piece that  is that Mary's hand? yeah that's the Virgin's hand that's Mary's hand cuz the, it's a nice hand but the thumb is kind of masculine. maybe i'm just crazy.    she's a big lady she's not that big yeah well she has to ha- she's got she's taken, yeah but that one thumb is kind of, anachronistic, (xx) well i think all the fingers look kind of big. really? well maybe yeah, well i mean i'm not there's like a callous on her thumb? you know, i got big hands wait what do you mean that the  no, but do you see that you see that ridge? kind of? show me on the slide just get up and show me on the you're right. he shouldn't have he shouldn't have finished this. see? it's a reflection. he should've started all over. i think it's a reflection it looks like a reflection.   naah, this wasn't very good. we'll send a letter to the Vatican. we'll send a letter to the Vatican. um, and and the other thing that you have to understand too is that Michelangelo did s- like well, most of the Renaissance artists study anatomy, he studied anatomy by dissecting corpses, um and so he knew, um, he knew very well what was underneath the flesh and he works very hard, to represent that. it's quite ana- what's what what it's analogous to, is um, you know when when Berger talks about the rise of illusionism again with with oil painting, and people tried very hard artists tried very hard to, to create the textures of things and the, the um exact color of things and deep space, a real illusion of, of the real world on the surface on the canvas. um, here Michelangelo is attempting to do that same kind of mimicking, but in sculpture. and he develops all sorts of techniques to do it. he's someone who brings it along, in an incredible way, i mean he's really a, a a person who, begins to um, kind of explain in stone what the human body is is all about. so ooh. that is gross.     she's a prostitute she's a whore. yeah. that Christ redeemed. tell tell the story, someone. she washed Jesus' feet with her hair and then with her tears she was what? and her tears. she was a she was like a you know, like a dirty old prostitute, and uh, a very old prostitute? well that's not what i said. i don't think she was an old prostitute when  what? she just saw Jesus and wanted to be redeemed and cried and washed his f- his feet with her tears and her hair. and he redeemed her. alright.  did Michelangelo do any wood sculptures? what? i don't know. i don't know. there they did discover a wooden cross that some people claimed was by Michelangelo but i don't know. i mean, i don't know of any one that's kind of standard, you know what i mean? (we) just don't know... there are a lot of works that like there are a lot of Renaissance works that are lost. that we just don't know anything about.       is depicted. and the way her hair she's wearing a hair shirt, in addition to her hair to her long hair. but that, can you see how the texture of the wood really affects, the quality of the, sculpture, the kind of effect of the sculpture. the arm is so bizarre.  what did she say was popular?   yeah. using softer tools. yeah you use you use well use softer tools what what hands your hands hands. your hands yeah. and that makes a huge difference. the hands and what the hands, um, can do in fact if you look, closely on this you can actually see, the way you can on some oil painting when we looked at the Monet you can see the hands of the artist imprinted, in what used to be the clay and, let's see if we can,  yeah you can yeah, you can see, you know you can see him doing something like that. why don't you come up, close, closer? or look at the lip there's another place, where you can kind of see, so guys come on... get in there. you stay there and sit... do you see (xx) yes. can you see him just taking his thumb, and doing some of those things? or his little finger? do we just sit here? yeah just stay there if you want. just g- actually why don't you  you know what you could sit on the floor if you want to move the table. does anybody wanna move the table? what do- it's not, i don't think it's a problem. it isn't? okay (xx) just sit up here and don't, go back. isn't this like sitting too close to the television screen. no it isn't. so would he, would he uh, would he have have ended up cutting that hole that's sticking into her hip away? i think so, but it looks like sh- it's the it's at the point where  oh n- nothing nothing. i was just, it's a big mean cat. that is a big mean cat.  what's going on behind it? what's that white stuff? oh i think it's the slide. don't you think? i don't know i'm not sure. yeah it looks like it's (xx) i think it's the slide. it's glue on the Degas this one? yeah on the Degas, The Dancer. you can see the fingerprints of the artist, and how he's  what? no this is actually bronze. we're gonna talk about it. what happens is that, the clay of course isn't gonna last, right? so you have to cast it you have to do something with it and i'll, show something in just a minute wait. aren't almost all these hollow? hollow? a  yeah you have to hollow it so it doesn't blow up yeah yeah. the bronze. now this isn't. this is not bronze, this is plaster, and we're gon- i'll let me, explain that, that, how that works. i'll be damned if that's hollow. you're a wise guy. that thing's massive. (xx) why, there could be like a wire frame underneath. okay. so the fa- after you've modeled the um, after you've modeled the wax, or the whatever it is the clay you're gonna do. the next thing that you do, is you're gonna cast, the sculpture in plaster. that's the first step. and that's what you're seeing up on the board, on the board, on the screen, over on the right... so, it's and the plaster cast um, is going to be used to make the final work, in bronze. a plaster cast is a lot more durable and easier to handle than, clay or wax. so, what happens is that when the clay or wax or plasticine model is ready, plaster of paris is used to form a mold, the mold is then cast in bronze or some other durable material. so what you're seeing, there is the plaster mold, on the right side, or left side. where where? mhm this is stupid get over the cat. i don't see the cat. show me the cat. i see the cat.  show me the cat. little funny nose of cat, mouth of cat chin is open  that's a smile? i see a totally   looks pretty hungry to me. man that's the  oh that's bad. yeah (it just looks) really awful. is that that in guys, does anybody know where this is? Amsterdam no. Germany nope. no. not Michigan. no not Michigan. do you recognize, you don't recognize the background? is it New York? yes. well see in the picture on the left it's such an ugly sculpture. yeah? mhm okay. how, how tall is this? how tall is this? life size. a little bit more than life size actually. now the thing, the thing of how, the um casting is that you can actually cast a whole bunch of things. i mean you can, once you've got you've got a mold you can cast a whole, number of things. and so there're more than one bronze Balzacs all around ah i can't see the cat. i can't describe it to you. it's okay. it's scary. well there's two cats. yeah, there are two cats. i see another cat that's facing the other direction. that's like that's like tuna o- with on his cheek. yeah that's the big scary cat. i can't see whatever she's trying to find something. oh. guys you're like, this is like camp. i'm telling you Rodin's house? Rodin's house, yeah in Meudon, which is in, in France M E U D O N so you can go visit it there too. in addition to the Sculpture Garden. so site is really important. and site participates in, what comes to be the iconography of the sculpture. i'm gonna ask you now a question. do any of you know the um i don't have a slide of it but do any do any of you know the sculpture that's on the grounds of Rackham? sorry? the thing the fre- the one on the building, on the side? no. well yeah the one on the side. the Holocaust one? the Holocaust one. right. yeah yeah. yeah. yeah where he's holding his hand so it's a it's a it's a monument to the Holocaust, and it's on the grounds of Rackham. now, why why do you think that site was chosen? was Rackham Jewish? no. uh where is it? next to Rackham  oh, okay why would they put it there? most people would see it it's a nice place for a cemetery. space. um, so a high viewing,  mhm. think. light? no. well part- i mean partly. think of what what what do you think that ground, what do you think that ground could've been? dirt. dirt is good. uh maybe it was uh well you know East Quad was used for by the army during World War Two for Japanese language training so maybe they did something over there (the army) could be, yeah that could be.  what about ground though? think about ground. are there people  was it a grave? like yeah graves, like a burial ground. what? and flowers grow up out of graves that's not (mean) you can't just bury people wherever you want. what kind of a gr- what kind of a graveyard do you think it would be, have been? unmarked? is it a mass grave? no. they just found it and they're like   a Jewish cemetery? excellent. it was a Jewish cemetery  okay. okay so, weird what?   wh- say that again. did they move the bodies or are they still there? they just like, took out the graves or something? i don't, i really don't know. i think it's built over i mean y- all well you know i think tha- that's the kind of information like you could go your whole life without knowing. that's true. but now once i tell you that though doesn't that doesn't that affect your perception of the sculpture or no? or when you walk past the sculpture are you not gonna feel different about it or no? actually probably. yeah i'll probably feel different about it and, i don't think i will. okay. what? what did Zack say? no because it's, in either case it's still a chilling reminder of, tragedy. yeah yeah. yeah. yeah it's a and that's the other connection too. you wanna talk about that Raoul Wallenberg? hm? Raoul Wallenberg. um i don't know briefly he was an architecture student at the University of Michigan from, was it Hungary? i forget where but, regardless he was from Europe  huh? wasn't it Sweden? it might've been Sweden i, i completely can't  anyways so um, he was called back to Europe, to be at some kind of administrative assistant in, the embassy. and he used that position to help funnel Jews out of Europe into the United States. yes. yeah, but he got thousands of, Jews out. all the Scandinavians were doing stuff like that, the Swedish and the uh, Finnish I think. weren't they all smuggling Jews? they were taking 'em in yeah and they were taking 'em in,  it was the Danish. and the Danish. and hiding them.

Beth, what's the deal with this Plata, the head on him? he's looking up. he's looking up. what? where's his face? where? he's bald but he has a beard. there's his nose, there's like his, ears, oh oh. so that's his chin that's like, facing (the sky) so i thought that was his i thought that was his face down there. right there? he's bald. lookit, isn't that the back of him? yeah. that's the back of him. yeah. no no he's, he's bald. cuz see yeah, that's the back of his head. so he's looking up at the church he's looking up at the church, and there happens to be an obelisk i mean i can't, i don't have the slides with_ there's happens to be an obelisk in the center and on the obelisk is the insignia of the pope. oh. doing the Lord's work. do the Lord's work, right. did you see The Simpsons? and so what happens is that the Jesus. yeah yeah the first one. Egypt yeah. the Nile. the Nile. yeah the Nile. the Nile. what was what's going on with the Nile? denial, of the church. the Nile's in denial. denial of the church that's right. oh my god, that was so bad that was terrific. oh God. the Nile's in denial. okay let's go back one and find him i'm sorry i'm very tired. i can't help it. here is the Nile, and you'll notice that the Nile has a cover over his head. right? blind. oh he hasn't seen the light. no, he hasn't seen the light. he's not able to see the light. how come? cuz he's not converted yet. cuz they aren't converted yet. so the other ones were converted already? well i think they thought  but they got the obelisk. they did get the obelisk that's you know you know that there's like something sort of like this in front of the Pantheon, in Rome mhm,  oh God. another (iconograph) so i wrote a paper about the imperialism of McDonald's. there you go. that's it. that is McDonald's. so the important thing is you need to find out, not only kinda what's going on in the sculpture but what is the relationship to the site. that's really really mucho important. okay and that concludes our very exciting discussion of sculpture, today, the last day before, woohoo spring break yea  do you have any extra sheets on the next writing assignment? extra sheets on the next assignment. i should have them in my book but if i don't, lemme, hang on and lemme, oh jeez it's a good thing i'm so nimble. this is probably the weirdest class you've ever been to. oh no i was an R-C student. oh my god. oh really you were? oh okay, so you know... so where's everybody going for spring vacation?

God. (xx) so, you guys coming to (clip) this weekend? i cannot. i think i might be coming to a panel or two. i need to look more specifically at them. you don't have to. i'll come and sit in.   last year was very good yeah, it was fun. see i didn't get to go last year so i need to go now. i think (Ross's) talk should be interesting. um, ooh that's at five yeah i was thinking about maybe going to that. i'm going to a job talk, and um, i'm so sorry, that i'm gonna miss (Ross's thing) i think it's_ it think it'll be fun yeah i'm sure it's gonna be great. i hope it'll be alright with the weather though i know yeah i'm worried about that. just gonna, pass that on down to, i'm sorry what was your name again? sorry. Rodney. wha- pardon me? Rodney Rodney. okay great. thank you.  i should put that next to the, the um, four foot mirror that another student, turned in. four foot mirror? she claims she stalked, Robert Urich. yeah really she thinks it's really, she really thinks it's him. huh what do you mean he ripped up his bagels? she just like was looking at him like, that man is like really gross she's like use a knife.  Jeff Daniels, i could see that. yeah yeah i could  why  Purple Rose Theatre.  Bob Seger? really? Bob Seger lives in Ann Arbor. (yeah) interesting. doesn't he? i don't know i don't know think he does. that's what i heard. hmm. excellent all those_ you know like Iggy Pop all those people are from  Madonna Madonna right that's right this is, anyhoo yes...   should we start with the Benjamin? we can start anywhere. that would be great. i'm kind of interested about this book, Paris Capital of the Nineteenth Century. is the entire book just these tiny little essays just through the entire thing? or the book is called, The Arcades Project, the  mhm mhm mhm mkay mhm mhm it's really not too um, not to critic- i mean not compared to, the other one that we read. um you know basically he just says that, Haussmann built it, built the, boulevard to um, protect civil, to to avoid civil war. mhm right. the what was pretty mild? the style. the style yeah yeah it was fairly general. and it sort of seemed like the Willms article was, written in reaction to him  i think also that on page one-sixty that um, the sixth line from the, top. where that mhm mhm uhuh mhm mhm that's so fleeting, you know, like the just that little yeah yeah i do   mhm. mhm yeah reading that as um, it kind of brought to mind what's happening today even, uh with the uh national library and at um Bercy. mhm mhm mhm does, uh but then, what you guys are saying does hold up in the next paragraph the, true purpose was to secure the city against civil war. you know it's not like the power politics behind it all that we get in the, yeah  he also places all the blame or credit, um, on Haussmann. i mean he barely brings up um, Napoleon. yeah, mhm yeah um, right which is, i think one of the, the real stark contrasts mhm yeah Haussmann sort of carried it out but basically it was Napoleon that wanted to do this and he had already been making plans etcetera etcetera. hm. because of his fears. uhuh mhm  right. so in fact it's both. it's both those dis- possibilities. but how does that also help, that notion of the barricades how does that help them, him, move it to the conclusion? mhm mhm well and it reduces the, the boulevard to just, the purpose of, of preventing barricades too. it doesn't explore any of the other, benefits perhaps of having the boulevard or other disadvantages, to them. right. so again it reduces, ben- the f- the, the sort of, in a sense import of of Benjamin's, argument. is that is that what you_ would you agree? mhm. although i think that Benjamin himself doesn't, necessarily see all the advantages and disadvantages. mhm no and i mean, he basically_ isn't he just saying there was a complete and total failure because of the commune and he's  mhm. right. right and so he can actually use, that's, even though this is all very sketchy he actually uses, Haussmann to be able to push forward int- up to, just about the time that he's writing. you know to, surrealism. in the twenties. so up until about, the the, t- he's writings this in the thirties so, um, yeah. it points to the i- the illusion first of all. um, of, the, the impossibility of, barricades. mhm well it could be, well, i think it does but, but it could also be like the purpose, i mean the fact that it was the purpose doesn't doesn't necessarily mean that it, that it was accomplished right? mhm and i don't think his, i i think in fact he, he mentions a little bit like, how barricades were, were possi- in the sentence like yeah right in the next part. so, that the purpose in this sense is not necessarily consequence or result. it's just the en- um, it's just his intention? his intention. right um i sort of got lost, a little bit, right toward the end. mhm that's a good question anyone wanna tackle that? i don't wanna tackle that but i want, mhm mhm  (really) i didn't know what to do with surrealism, at the end of all this, either. yeah yeah cla- yeah i would say or the promise that modernity, um yeah is it though? one of_ well one of them. i mean  mm right. mhm well i think of when he says dreams you know the promise of, uh modernity i i think more of like a liberal, uh democratic economy mhm wait can you explain that again? um, yeah so when he's talking about realization of dream elements you know um, i think of that as like the promise of capitalism, or liberal democracy, for the bourgeoisie. um, but all that collapsed, um, at the end of the nineteenth century, and um, that i mean that's basically how i read the last sentence i guess, in the convulsions of the commodity economy. in trying to reach them that's, that it it convulsed it it just exploded it didn't work. that makes a lotta sense. and not only did they talk about, uh commodity economy but he brings in you know, the dialectical thinking as, mhm mhm mm mhm i think there's a lot of things in there that aren't quite making it. right? i mean there is, the dream of, the bourgeoisification. mhm mm. so is Haussmann just being held up as the paradigmatic figure of the, attempt that just doesn't, ultimately work? is that why this is all attached to, him and the barricades? i don't know. (i mean) i think, that dashed hopes.  he represents sort of a model of, of the hope of of modernism. modernity and and, yeah, i i think that's what he is   the idea not necessarily the success mhm um, i have kind of a, an idea but, it's a it's, truly negated by post-World War Two culture. i mean, in a sense if, what the reading, that Benjamin is giving in in um, the mid-nineteen thirties here, early nineteen thirties, is that that moment, which can be seen either through its objects, arcades panoramas or through its ideals, um, is already in ruins and he's writing at this_ at a moment when he's seeing the co- the destruction of the last of the arcades in Paris. some of which are_ but there's like five that are saved or something. um, and remember he sees the arcades the kind of crumbling, of the arcades as a kind of etiology, um, E T no how do_ etiol- i don't know how the heck that's pronounced. mhm this is kind of a different topic but i just, was trying to figure out where the beginning of this (all came) into it. um, one-forty-nine because as i was reading this um, this morning i, like, gambling converts time into narcotic sentence, just so, directly does not go with the films from last night. where time was the regulat- the regulatory, function and you know, time was not a, narcotic, not in the same way, and then when i was trying to figure out what that went with, it was the stock exchange and so more about, commodities and, um commodity economy, and how that kind of works its way into a dreamscape. so, through the, through this connection of gambling, from that um... uh, i'm very glad you brought that up because while i haven't really thought about it i just realized of course that, if Benjamin is writing in the early nineteen thirties this would be s- at the moment, just few years past the great crash and, the height of various different kinds of economic, sort of early, early um, tremblings of economic crisis. so um  perhaps in the time of the factory that we saw last night the time, the time does not belong to them, to those people it's more like they belong to the time right? as opposed perhaps to the people in the, in the garden in Metropolis, mhm right. so gambling could be more like, for them, for the people that, have the time. right where that's the only, space in which, that kind of notion of time can remain, within a leisure class that is not, even a bourgeois class it's almost like an aris- an mhm but i think that the notion of gambling really works well for both. mhm right. and that um, with Haussmann's, uh transformation of Paris he brings along with him, um land value, a land value system based on real estate speculation. that the city had not, known to that point. that is areas that were considered, unsanitary and unhealthy, which would've just been torn down, were now in fact being rebuilt, in a kind of bourgeois model. um you know the sort of, all those rows of, rue de Rivoli is a very good example in Paris where all of the facades are exactly the same. you have the gallery underneath, right? and the the front, the work, the architectural work is based on a kind of um, uh m- mass production of these like stone edif- stone ornamentation, for the edifice, the facade, so, um, yeah i mean i think that_ and and Willms actually quotes La Curee in in the article. that, obviously the gambling, works well with, that notion of real estate speculation. um, and the stock exchange displaces gaining, or gambling, that kind of speculation i'm thinking of Manon Lascaux. i don't know if you're familiar with that novel from, eighteen, mid-eighteen, mid-eighteen, seventeen something (xx) oh man, yeah. so um, where gambling is equated with a descent into the underworld. that that is the, that's the, and it's only for the very wealthy. mhm maybe just the time necessary for them to catch on, as commodities, and right, i mean some ways you'd think that Benjamin would be kind of celebrating, the demise, he doesn't seem to be, he seems to be more interested in this dialectical movement um, in a kind of Marxist interpretation of history so, it's strange that one would the very f- second sentence um, the, (xx) between mhm right. well perhaps, the creation of the boulevard, creates, a space, in which, um, a a commodity economy can flourish, but before then the kin- i- the the commodities themselves are kind of on the brink. but this new construction where the bottom floor is, uh reserved for commercial use, really creates a, a rather large space where, the commodity economy can succeed, once and for all. right. mhm so this will to, like, totalization, is a failure because, this brink, is in fact hesitation? it's not just that hesi- you know they hesitate on the brink but the brink itself is hesitation? is that what, what yeah or like that dream world and, right mhm right right yeah, i mean i think that this is um, yeah the close reading, stumps the, s- i mean in a sense i guess we're supposed to be stumped by Benjamin. in that very sort of, that way of writing that, one could perhaps write an entire dissertation on, what is, the brink in modernity? you know. (xx) gonna take it Jaime and i are gonna fight over that one. the brink is mine. he's the artist in demolition. he's the artist in demolition, exactly right. so he's not just, he's he's criminal and, artist in demolition. for Willms,  right. he was very popular with the workers was he not? because he was seen as someone who was creating jobs. maybe not for people that were getting expelled from their homes but, like um, the masons etcetera etcetera oh yeah. oh yeah and um, and at the time, did they realize how corrupt his, his accounts were? was that made public or did that, did they find out much later? that was, um, it would've probably_ i mean i'm not i don't know for sure, mhm (mhm) mhm mhm mhm oh okay. well it's perfect for the third republic then, for them to just trash, Haussmann and mhm right, um, so, at this time there were many people who were critical, right the, there were there were, critics of Haussmann and the Paris plan, because they believed, that Haussmann was really doing exactly what Benjamin said he was doing which is basically protecting against civil war. but because, that was in a sense a part of the hidden agenda, that was never made public. so the, the the critics were always um, sort of stopped in their tracks by Haussmann and Napoleon publishing, these tracts about why they were doing this which never had anything to do with, the um the civil war. um mhm i thought it was interesting how he, um, talks about, um, Haussmann being the, this is the, the last paragraph the last, part of the last paragraph, it said yes.  mhm. so how does_ i mean given what you just said, how does Willms see Haussmann ultimately? as a benefactor. right, as a benefactor. mhm mhm he would fit into the um, the planner with a vision and,  i thought it was interesting Willms also talks about um, how this whole plan was much more my er- much more than just a reaction to like eighteen thirty and eighteen fourty-eight but more that he just, was obsessed with the idea of having like complete control over like the urban space right? mhm (xx) (urban landscape) um, yeah complete control. mhm mhm and i guess this mapmaking comes like, from, i don't know the fifteenth century perhaps? in like, when empires are being formed, it's like to have the control and to and to, use it as a symbol also for, for control. mhm, right. and i heard a, a really interesting lecture about various different cities and, in Rome Pope Sixtus so in, Pope Sixtus the fifth  mhm yeah outsides of what? that's key. what i- what're they_ cuz you're absolutely right. tax wall isn't it? right. outside the tax wall. mhm does any part of that wall still exist? i don't remember any mention of it (here.) the, Porte d'Orleans all those Porte de whatevers, that's hm  mhm mm, okay... (xx) in a sense it's a process by which, the expropriation of, um, the, the houses that belong to lower classes, is, the that land is used, to build um, constructions that would attract the um, the bourgeoisie. that, right. mhm mhm. movement and, if you have, those big bourgeois buildings, apartment buildings, backing up to, these, very small pockets, which are left of those, working class neighborhoods, you not only create movement but also a kind of proximity, that had never existed before. right? um, a kind of proximity that, in some ways, Baudelaire becomes very distinctly aware of. um, at the same time, and this is the kind of irony that i believe Mr Willms, uh misses, is that in, the development of this, these buildings, um, which were designed primarily for sort of bourgeois, i'll quote mhm  yes mhm, right.... and the the the um, the parts of the city that don't get changed, that don't really get um, they don't experience any upheaval, either with the real estate market, speculation or, demolition are these neighborhoods in the sixteenth and seventeenth arrondisement which are the, what Willms called the refuges of the rich. so the pockets of the aristocracy never get touched. and yet, as, as you point out Filipe there's als- there's a potential though for movement, of the very wealthy, and upper bourgeois classes to these new apartment buildings. right? on like the Champs Elysees and, and various parts of um, mostly the right bank. um, but really those pockets still stay stay the same. and in fact have remained the same to this day. another thing there is, i don't know exactly how that works but, but i thought it was interesting the way that all those, um, new apartments, had, like the, the side that faced the, the street was, the living room and the dining room and so, in a sense like, the, the everyday life is also uniformed in its relation of the public and private, areas. right... right, yeah and i think that, that would be another way in wh- which in fact goes, along with some of what we saw in that film The City last night. with the planned cities and towns, um, that there's a regularization of, the everyday life. and i hadn't actually thought about it in terms of space but you're right. that everyone ends up in some ways in those apartments with the same sort of... both the same public and private space, and recognition of it... which Willms doesn't s- i mean i, i tend to critique that kind of, uniformity, planned uniformity, uh but Willms doesn't seem to do that. because i think, he sees Haussmann as you pointed out at the end as this sort of great, um, transformer, a great planner... so um, let's, i think... take a break. and when we come back, we'll um... do maybe some close readings of the Baudelaire, with the Berman and knowing what you know about Haussmann, and maybe tease out, um, a reading, um of, especially the i mean The Eyes of the Poor, but i also tend to like The Rope for instance, um myself. uh or any other poems. that sound good? and obviously if you have more to say about Haussmann i mean you're welcome. and then we'll talk about some of the films. okay. so, break. i have to run over to Rackham, to get some, papers so, just wait for me if i'm running a little late but that's kind of what? well that's all they want you to be able to do. it's reading knowledge. (oh yeah, i have to do that next semester.) can you do it next semester? i think so. well, i don't know. double check and make sure  or if i were you, if it's more, appealing, just take the third just do the, (thingy)  that's true (xx) yeah that would work maybe i'll just (another Spanish) (xx.) we'll see. it's so weird, to get that email from Catherine about the, the weekend (you know Brody we can) hear you outside. uh oh. hey, uh Laura did you get my student's copy of the test to grade yet? or no? it has it made its way to you yet? Phillipe Montesquieu? i don't remem- i haven't checked my box since before i taught. okay. Jenny's okay, yeah i got that too. i think, Jen- i know that Catherine has a student whose, test has been in Jenny's box all week. i put it in Jenny's box on Monday, and it hasn't been touched. so i don't know if you've graded that one or not. it's Catherine's  okay. well  okay. okay. yeah she must not cuz i put,  okay.   you don't drive in do you? drive into yes you do? mhm yeah yeah i know. and they have, well actually it's (not a problem) cuz Alex's daycare, he doesn't go to daycare on Friday so, but that's good. um, one other, do we know if the, oral eval is in the Mac Lab or in the, one that, the one inside the L-R-C? inside the L-R-C. it is inside? okay good. yeah. excellent it'll be pretty much exactly like last time. okay cool. and was this (cuz that was it) alright cool. no change. alright  yeah (don't wanna) corral them up. other room guys. sorry. ugh. i have no paper topic for this class. and not even one that's like, coming to me either yeah i don't know what to do either. and we're halfway done, uhuh uhuh yeah you know what you're doing for the summer? i'm gonna go to Africa. oh. are you going back? well yep.   great yay that'll be awesome.   same place, same,  i stay um, with the woman who's the program director of my study abroad. but, i um, hope that i'll find someplace else. cool. what do you do there? i take classes in the mornings, from eight to twelve, and then, what classes? Housa. oh. um, which is, fun but kind of painful cuz it's four hours just me and a professor and oh it's just the two of you? yeah. and  one of mhm one of 'em yeah. and so, and then in the afternoons, i just have fun. enjoying like a good museum,   how 'bout you? i don't know yet. i'm i think i'll probably go back to Chicago my parents live there and i think i'm gonna try and teach French at like a community college type thing, oh that's good. mhm wow that's a good idea, yeah. yeah mhm  yeah. i have no idea.   well my, the memo to the department for, you know that kind of funding is due tomorrow and i'm gonna forget      yeah  d'oh oh dear right d'oh     yeah i still   uh s- just blame it on the French.  right. yeah mhm i hate applying for summer money. i know i know this sounds really pompous but i just don't wanna work, this summer. mhm yeah that's why i go to Africa because i take, you know, language classes and just have fun and hang out. yeah yeah it's all good. yeah, this summer i need to read read read read i need to get one of those like boring jobs like, nine to five, probably in a book store where they'll give me a nice big discount. mhm yeah that's no fun. no it's really not. it sucks. but, i've had a great summer job the last five years so, i guess i'm, yeah mhm mhm too expensive. yeah it is. the beer is expensive too. one benefit of being allergic to  you're allergic to alcohol? i am. most unfortunately. oh no  i get really ill. oh   that's so unfortunate. i know. but i can have, i can have like a, hard drink or two. but that's the limit. so. (terrible) you can't, you can't drink and you don't like chocolate i know. i'm kind of a freak.  wow. wow. well you can't give up, all the things   i do  i uh, for so- for some reason i only have the like the first page of this. i went to read the,  well do you have      so it might've just separated itself  ohh so you need a copy of the,  that history book that you brought into uh four-hundred-level class let me think, i think i already know this (mess.) it starts at uh, okay.  some, some people yes. some people i know have applied for it oh really? yeah. from, my department. okay so i wanna return this to you. this is so cool. you like it? mhm you know i been walking around all day tapping, and i in fact have a tack in the bottom of my shoe. okay, let's see here. (Willms) (xx) i was trying to figure out why i knew the title of that book. (xx) each article. (where do i know that from?) yeah it's uh... it's a famous book. okay. so, i mean i a- guess i asked a really, sort of general question about Baudelaire and um, Berman and Haussmann. so... we can kind of take this up from various different points but, i thought, that at least with... i guess The Pauper's Toy works also quite well in this discussion as does, The Eyes of the Poor. but maybe if we start with The Eyes of the Poor, from Spleen, just take the eyes of the poor and rip 'em out of the spleen. um, well there's the vision of the um, let's see, what does it say? the um, this, third paragraph that first, sentence there. um, when it's talking about uh, so it's not and it's not just the sort of unfinished splendor it's also, right? the bre- in that same beginning of that same paragraph mhm mhm, yeah mhm. and just the detail, that he goes into, of what's inside. kinda the the the campy that's what Berman says what're the other words besides gaudy? campy that would be of course our reading, of it. mhm mhm, mhm. gluttony gluttony. right. so, gaudy, gluttony what else?  decadent. decadent very busy too there's, i don't know but when i read that i just, everything, um, there's sort of an underlying theme of movement. mhm mhm i think also um, since i always harp on the classical oh yeah mhm mhm mhm. also i think the idea of um, being able to have privacy in a public space, is a r- is a result of the, Haussmannization of, of Paris these two, lovers can sit at a table and, and have their privacy but yet they're in a space that, um, you know that anyone can walk into mhm um, the description of the cafe also reflects a lot of what, Baudelaire um, seems fascinated by, modernity with you know it sparkles um, it's bright, it's and among those, new things are all these classic, the idea of being able to see at night too, because of the gas lights, mhm so that, those elements that we brought up earlier about movement and proximity, um, sort of explode in this, encounter. mhm. and explode in a, in a particular, way here because, like the the way Willms, (Willms what's his,) mhm yeah mhm it also kind of reminded me of um, i think it's, Mary Louise Pratt who talks about the contact zone? is it her? hm? but yet there's no real interaction between them. you know people looking in and the people looking out, mhm mhm yeah yeah there was a part in the Berman article too that, you know when they were, when he describes, the the the, but what about when um, the eyes of the father say says um  mhm  mhm yeah they're just sort of observing and, giving their commentary on it but, you know they d- they don't, try to go in they don't you know lament that they, they can't they they just look. mhm  so it's the (xx) with the, coffee house, assignment. because just, as i was looking out at people you know  yeah um, Berman might be reading that, the way he does based on that, just that little signal that, the but, but only people not like us when the k- mhm mhm   yeah        but maybe the father's already past the point of of even, even wa- like going in there  mhm  mhm  yeah exactly i mean it is the, right?  mhm  it is an interesting thing that the way he, u- he, imagines this communication only through the eyes yeah  mhm and then i think that's highlighted through the jarring juxtaposition of the last paragraph, where you know this woman that he's supposedly in love with he can't read her eyes, and he's shocked when he finds out what she's thinking.  mhm yeah, exactly. yeah that's right. um, i just had a sm- minor question about the form of the_ of all these poems really. um, Berman has stated on one-forty-eight then that it is crucial to remember that the poems, in, Paris Spleen, do not present themselves as verse, mhm where is that? sorry. uh one-forty-eight.  um, um okay.  no that's okay. but i should've hijacked um, some of Margie's work cuz, as i was saying before i- Margie in in Wilder in comp lit has um, photogra- uh photocopies of the f- of the like the front page of these newspapers, from this time. and there's always like the news, and then a line on the front page and then this like opinion piece or observation piece, very much like, Bart- Barthes was writing, those mythology pieces, from the fifties in in um, Le Monde those are just sort of that same style, um, we don't really have a tradition in the_ in American papers we have the op-ed page. but there's no real tradition of, um, i mean there's a tradition of, the news, oh, is it the syndicated, sort of news discussant? i don't even know what to call them anymore. do you know what i mean? you know like the K- you know the Hamblin the, all those i can't think of their names right now cuz i'm blanking. entirely. mhm. that sounds good. mhm yeah commentators? oh okay mhm okay. columnists. columnists. syndicated columnists syndicated columnists. (xx) take me a minute but i got there. suggests, something that, um, let me just double check cuz now i'm not sure. i think it suggests, that um, that he could, he could be, could be her? mhm so they are actually what he says at the beginning. you know that we had promised ourselves that day that we would be two halves of the same soul.  i think that's a possible reading. that's why he hates her because he did actually see his own thoughts in her eyes. mhm... mhm. right so there's and applied to the, Haussmannization of Paris, it would be like, that, conscience of Paris that has been, um, attacked by two, fronts or, that it is now composed of two juxtaposed, sides. two juxtaposed sides that um, are now proximate. yeah mhm and dangerously near. mhm, right. though he does say that, that there is no, hostile undertone in, in the way they they look at them. mhm. i just had a quick question. on the bottom of page eighty-three when it says, um... yes? okay. i'll toss a coin. ohh i don't _ i just, i it could work i mean if he's elevating this family. which paragraph? uh the very last line on page eighty-three. yeah well i (xx) oh,   it starts with um oh okay. and then  um, (xx)  (mhm) mhm mhm so i, i'm sorry i need to look at this for a second (i am curious) you said oh i see what you're saying, right. took me a minute there. coulda been clearer too. no no i don't have the French in front of me i left my book at home. um, yeah, cuz i saw this being a, a poem very much between, the narrator and right, with the woman. right. well i think, when i initially read it i did but then because, i w- i actually, in a sense agree with the reading of Berman, that it's actually him struggling with himself, and the side that he actually can't struggle with is the the feminine, side, this impermeable side. mhm he has a conscience. um, s- so, i mean at a- at a certain point, um, at the bottom of the paragraph on page one-fifty-four in the Berman he says, um, it just is so cuz he's he just does the reading about the man who hates that part of himself. mhm mhm   are you s- suggesting a, a link between the narrator and the street? is that what i'm, hearing? or am i just a link between the narrator and, the street, like, the conflictedness of the narrator (is enlarged to the half-finished half rubble.) are y- were you saying that or am i just hearing you, differently? i'm saying that he is feeling conflict based on, what he sees in the street. oh okay. mhm alright when Berman says that that, in the, re- m- uh, in the barricades they could be at, different, on different sides, i would, yeah i would see that, i would say that here, at least it's presented that way because uh, because the poor and the narrator are, all talking through their eyes only right? whereas the, the woman or that feminine side is, who's shown with different kinds of eyes because her eyes are like, almost perverse right mhm mhm mhm. just going back to your um, word play very quickly. you know that would also work, mm. right. mhm in the, in the earlier works, like his, windows were more like, that kind of, i don't know, what it's called like mirror, window or something like, mhm mhm right. right... only, our man doesn't really wanna communicate. mhm mhm actually could i, yes   well if you remember part of, Haussmann's project was to um decimate, in his words rehabilitate, the poor neighborhoods. mhm mhm mhm mhm didn't he also not, give out the whole plan right away cuz he didn't think it would be accepted, cuz it was gonna cost so much and,  right mm (xx) also wasn't like the uh, stated objectives to open up the city, mhm  mhm mhm  and there ya go  yeah mhm and in a sense they're mhm yeah ruins, yeah, of a different sort. yeah right. i mean they could be actually read as, the the newest class of homelessness. mhm uhuh mhm makeup makeup yeah makeup right. right. um, exactly. perhaps they could also be, when they looked inside, they could also be, yeah right. right. and look at the gaudiness that has taken over, mhm   right. i mean we talked_ i mean i'm gonna sort of get off the topic just for one second before we go to The Pauper story but um, one of the clips from the film last night, um, i love that clip of like the happy living, the filthy city living and i'll show you that clip again, when we talk talk about it. but um i was reminded when i was a kid, in the nin- early nineteen seventies houses were destroyed in our, the village i lived in to put in a highway. because through various federal programs and taxation programs, little towns could group together, and help finish highways. so this highway that was constructed between the city of Rochester and the, little town i lived in, was paid for along the way by three little towns. and they just like, wrecked these beautiful old homes that p- most people lived in and most of the people who lived in those homes were, um the working class but they were old ho- sort of large old homes and many of them had like tons of kids, or they were elderly, and they basically just, through eminent domain, the the, city, or at that point the town maybe the state bought the houses from the people for about thirteen thousand dollars which was market value. and the only homes that any of those people could afford were mobile homes, in the next county. right? so i mean that kind of, displacement, is is the kind of displacement that we're talking about here. but, for in Haussmann's time most the people are renters, so they get nothing. right their homes are just basically destroyed and they have to find housing elsewhere. so even with the notion of eminent domain and fair market value, there's no real compensation, that can be, that can be given. well for Haussmann it would be the jobs that were created, would be the, minimal sort of compensation you'd get. right. yeah, yeah so, well again the proximity. just, (we're already on that.) mhm right the possibility for proximity because of those boulevards, that now go out, to this, this, this kind of a neighborhood. it's still part of the city but just outside, right? um homes with gardens. yeah i think so. mhm  right, exactly. okay? and what's behind one set of bars? a rich kid and his fancy toy. right. um, right, the kid and the toy sort of similarly on display. um, and then on the other side of the grate, this is that sort of dialectical movement that keeps, that that Benjamin talks about that Berman talks about, on the other side, mhm rat. rat. why the fascination though, by the rich kid? well, maybe he's, i mean depending on, you know how he's been raised and what not, maybe he's never, come into contact with a rat so he doesn't ha- think you know, necessarily these negative connotations that people tend to have, tend to associate with rats but also i mean, it's alive it's something that's living and it moves and his toy doesn't move but this kid's toy moves. right so when they say he's greedily inspecting, a rare and unknown object, how, how is, his class, set up against, i mean he they're u- obviously Baudelaire's using this toy but how is class? i mean what're the words that denote him and his class just in that little, why greedy? it's exotic. it's all about commodities. and um, like the ephemerality of the commodity because the thing that was bought with a lot of money is thrown by the wayside, for this thing plucked out of, plucked out of life, extracted the toy from life itself, um, is that which (gains) attention. and you have to consume it, because you're not, you know who knows when this kid's gonna see it again? you wanna add something? no i'll wait. go ahead. mhm oh yeah de Certeau well de Certeau right yeah yeah so i was thinking that it had to relate somehow to that, but, i'm not sure exactly how. yeah i don't know but, but it's very interesting, yeah mhm because he definitely imposes class on these, kids. you know we have the one who is lovely and the other, you know the other categories of ordinary and poor. which i think is really funny, because the o- poor children aren't ordinary. but um, i mean so there's something being imposed on them. mhm maybe at this point they're too young to understand, you know capitalism and and value that's placed on an object. they just see the object, for what it is. you know they don't right mhm when he says, he looks at it greedily,   oh well yeah yeah i mean you're gonna be raised by your parents and you're gonna kinda pick up on that but i think he's still too young to really be like, you know, fully cognizant of, you know capitalist ideas and what not. at least at this point they, their, their teeth are still, equally white. yeah  mhm yeah yeah and their, teeth were equally white. right and the_ but the whiteness, mhm mhm mhm mhm. uh yeah. the the rat in the box um, struck me as similar to the surrealist um, film where they're looking at the hand on the ground. where you know it's what's grotesque but once you, look at it in a different way it becomes fascinating. mhm mhm you move it from its natural environment and then it   mhm yeah it is a very, problematic, i mean it does sort of romanticize them and yet, in one of the other poems that um, you may or may not have read i believe i_ i believe it's the one right before it. um which i'm_ (xx) spending time on The Cake, it's actually number fifteen so it wouldn't have been right before it. that actually the kids are like little um, they're like vicious fighting devouring, um, machines, that they attack the bread, oh don't they have  it's interesting too in the, footnote, footnote number two. um, ohh... and what do we do with the first two lines, first two sentences, well his innocent entertainment at least as i read it is, buying these cheap, toys oh so it's his own it's not the kid's entertainment? no i think it's the, narrator's entertainment... oh okay. does that make sense? he goes and buys, right   right. yeah. mhm. well it's still, i mean i still think that there is a kind of romanticization of childhood. but one that's kind of problematic and, i mean we saw it in the films last night absolutely. it's like when there is, despair one can always fall back on the children. children are the future. you know and in that sense i mean this, this this poem does that but obviously the w- earlier ones don't and then th- something like The Rope, mhm and so why, why would he choose, the teeth and the whiteness as that space where they come together where they are equal right?  the_ i i will tell you in secret the undergrads who read this poem, made an argument about you know, kids brushing their teeth. mhm   they could just be a symbol for eating, the ultimate consumption. mhm mhm right. in which case, eyes could have worked just as well since, seeing is the same kind of consumption. but, you know right yeah but it's not only the teeth but also the the whiteness that's  yeah baby teeth? thanks the baby teeth. mhm yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah ohh but also with that, that um, yes? i think that this, you know thinking, that, this is just a natural thing to do. but if we look in the second paragraph he says, you know he gives this whole, list of what kids do when they're, given something new. they look at it, they don't dare take it, they doubt their good fortune. and then they grab it and run. which, you know is very much a, you know this is mine i have control over it i have ownership. which is kind of what's going on here so, you know even if it is a kid thing to do and i think it is, it also is, tied up with this idea of of controlling and owning. you know which, they're not gonna lose. which is only gonna become, more prevalent. of course i don't know how teeth relate to that at all, but well, we have to think about, hesitation on the brink, the whiteness of the teeth, mhm it's always the parts of these machines too the close-ups never the whole  a- right the metonymy. right? that part, stands in for the, the menace. and then the ten hour day gets infused with this as well. okay. and what i wanna get to is the whistle. because the whistle, is the part that's like the whistle of the factory's (al-) is, embedded, within the city. uh oh the wizard. right the wizard, we need the wizard where's the wizard when we need him? yes i gave it an extra little shove. yeah, i saw that. oh     the, the, the music mhm mhm why yes right. mhm oh yeah.   well, that is, i mean if you look at Haussmann as the great decentralizer, that's why he's so, importantly the predecessor to urban planning. because urban planning at this point, was, building these garden cities or new cities. mhm well those are even still being built today like Disney World has one of those. oh yeah. yeah? i don't even know. (xx)   who paid for this, produc- uh production?    is it, to sort of seduce the taxpayer into thinking that, they should fund this? i mean, and who's the we? you know they kept saying we, we we we. we should provide this for everyone. and then it was the we of the working class. we don't deserve to live like this. (it's pretty) bizarre. well it was made for the nineteen thirty-nine World's Fair. oh mm probably mhm mhm well why would the Carn- Carnegie Foundation or whoever, why would they, why would they want this? well i'm_ you know this is interesting i'm not sure but you know at the same time there was a British film also called The City also made in nineteen thirty-nine, about the new cities, the the garden cit- what are called in the, in British vernacular you know garden cities. these are called like the new city, uh in in America. i don't know if there's a, if there's one, like one was a consequence of the other. that is the one, for England was made therefore the one in America had to made to prove that we too have this, this pastoral vision of the new city. or, you know vice versa. so, i i'm gonna say it's, two things. one is there is um, a kind of competition of um, developing an ideal living space. there's also a desire to um, sort of decongest, the city. but also that, at a World's Fair you wanna show the world, what, your, technology, can produce. your technology your know-how your American technology and know-how can produce, perfect harmonious living spaces. and the idea too of the happy worker is a better worker. mhm yeah oh right right. because you also have leisure time you're not stuck on these roads right? that whole sequence of the roads that ends with the car crashing. could they,  mhm the Carnegie Foundation? or yeah. i don't know anything about it it's just a question. oh that's a good question. it was a philanthropic organization but obviously behind yeah Carnegie got his money from somewhere. yeah steel   all his neighborhoods (xx,) you know right     mhm actually that just happened, where, right by where my parents live there's a, community that was built and, it's a lotta property but what they, chose to do was, they chose everyone chose to have their houses built on really teeny tiny lots, and that, all of the rest of it's open space that they all share. mhm mhm mhm great well i think what's really interesting about that vision, in fact you pointed to the, one of the central issues of this course is about circulation, transportation but that it's the airplane. right? that pa- again the panoptic vision. mhm mhm alright? and your presentation is on that last article there (xx) uh,  okay. so we should read the Prysbylski? what do you think? i don't know, i think it can't hurt, i mean it's a very interesting article. i'll email you guys. i'm not sure how much i'll focus on that, um i'll probably talk about, maybe the commune bring that in and then talk about the other stuff, just you know regulation of space in general. um, i might also talk about the situationists, in the commune. mhm um, would you mind at all just giving us a hint of what this dee- street distinctions assignment will be? cuz i won't be here for spring break, so if it's something that must be done in Ann Arbor then i need to do it, like, next week right after class or  can you say that again please? sure, i want you to map, the distinction, between, Liberty Street, mhm hm Carina when are your office hours? Tuesdays from one to three. but if that doesn't work with_ for you you should contact me to see if there's a better time. um, i'm gonna be on campus sadly, for myself, a lot next week. okay. 	1
OFC270MG048.json	two and one are independent of each other, right well it doesn't matter. basically in this case three doesn't matter you don't use rule w- one and two, to see that node two is indepen- node one is inde- and node two are independent. so it doesn't correlate to rule three. so knowing, you could have said knowing three or five and you'd still get the same result, that  well you could have said knowing nothing even, that node one is independent of node two. (independent) node one is,   right i see that but i haven't read through all the  right okay but oh okay that's why three isn't included just because since you_ it's evidence. yeah  right because you you already know it. but  well so the the table i- i- is saying that node two_ things that are independent of node two are node one and node five. okay alright now i didn't understand your reasoning for if this, using node one, chain is broken here but that's between five and one how does it relate  right so two could be anywhere in this  right so two could be where node four is obviously at that point node one would not be independent. with node four. right okay  right so you have to choose. okay cuz two and eight could be switched and it would be the same. yeah mhm... okay so um why don't you ask me about specific entries uh how about uh evidence four, so is one and seven independent? so, one and seven (exercise) one yeah so this is just a couple of, entries in there yeah i'm no- this is not complete. um the idea was is that i was giving examples of all of it so, one and seven is analogous to two and six, and two and seven. because again it's the chain. so the chain two-four-six and two-four-seven is exactly the same um, separation-wise as  okay so like five you're looking at like this? and like one of these? five and si- so for five and six? right    right yeah oh okay. so that's one of the reasons i didn't put it all in the  um so an example of this s- s- second rule i mean the second rule probably is the easiest one to look at cuz you have the, the f- the the four-six-seven type of relationship which just says if you know if you know node four, then um it breaks it breaks things off so here you have six is independent of everything. so six is independent of seven by rule two. and six is independent of everything else by rule one. i wrote rule one there but it's_ when it's all it's probably more than one rule so six is independent of seven by rule two. okay. may i a- may i ask a quick question? sure because i_ (the class has three) sure uh huh mhm  mhm  yeah use uh, probability of sunset and uh on-time and healthy is that is that what did you say? kay i mean this_ you_ this way is it (correct) or not? i, because in (palais) we, we just yeah   but but here, um i mean part A we don't know, uh this  right     yeah but but i mean here because uh if this true, uh, that's_ i mean even in part A this true is in- independent right? mm they're not independent. how ho- why are they independent? uh (lemme see.) i mean so  mhm yeah i mean in part A we need to combine these two into one node mhm yeah  yeah plus plus you uh the, uh, th- in, the conditional probability of sunset and the con- ah given the no-acc- acci- uh accident is true. so just pursue this probability right? yeah mhm   yeah four and also, i had four you had four or  four, i mean for this? yeah and probability of sunset and the conditionals i mean theory is that we should write a true-false and false-true or false-false. okay well for part B yeah for part A you had more than four right? uh in part A you mean we have, uh cuz you don't know anything about the network in part A right? you're just  yeah but in part A we already combined these t- two into single node, first   mhm okay well so you have to t- handle the case of both no-accident and ac- and not-no-accident. yeah yeah. okay  for this for this (problem?) for when you combine the two nodes how  eight. okay. that's what i wanted to hear.  so i have eight and then but here i mean for calculating probability of sunset, it's still four.  right   mhm mhm (you don't what ) uh this is what i what i want to get right?  mhm     is that s-  yeah i mean, is this is correct or not i mean here it's, equal to yeah plus the other three? yeah that's right? mhm okay that's what i was trying to get you to say the the the first calculation you use two times as many terms cuz you   yeah. the trouble is there are no i mean in mathematics there are no uh (restrict) and approve that this if this is correct. i just think intuitively that correct but i'm not very sure so mhm, yeah yeah. so it's  mhm  yeah so this correct (like that?) yeah mhm i had a question in the book i think_ i'm wondering if the book made feel free to sit down. just in writing this out, i even had to follow_ write the letters above it to make sure i was  hm. yeah let's let's write it down on a piece of paper cuz i i don't_ i tend to trust this book unless it's a well the_ i got the the rule from the book, yeah yeah yeah yeah. okay so i i'm just seeing all these words and the catch and the cavities and things are that's why i had to write the  right but if they  yeah i could_ should have rewritten   mkay, alright so here and they have probability of A, (and) B and C can be switched.  and replace all the Cs, oh, no. only  did i screw up there? okay  okay. let's_ why don't we write the the X Y and E above here in the book if you can  X Y E okay so let's first go through and mark all the cavities.   okay. so what do we have? we have probability of X given Y and E is equal to the probability of, w- Y given (did i make a mistake?) X and E... which which they've switched around which is okay okay so let's actually let's go through it again and switch the Y and the E around. i know this is making you erase stuff in your book but  this book has been around long enough that i would have thought that people would have, caught these things by now as opposed to us writing homework assignments that we make mistakes all the time.  okay   so these are just switched. yeah well okay. well that was easy. for now i haven't really started the homework yet. so... i need to make sure this email gets out somehow. what was it about? it was about that the examples changed as of nine o'clock this morning so that the noisy-or answers were different. oh well i    did you? but then the new uh examples are up on the web page. yeah uhuh oh so you got  since eleven o'clock it    oh so the email's just slow.   hi. i just don't understand, part C. okay uh huh okay um you can also use Bayes' Rule. ah Bayes' Rule  mhm.  (xx) right? mhm mhm  Bayes' Rule means we_ i can use a P sunset no-accident using this and can get this one? yes right so i mean th- this_ that's a big hint because you don't have to really for part C if you use Bayes' Rule you're pretty much done. mhm i don't   mhm mkay  n- they're dependent  yeah yeah they're dependent also not directly but they're dependent through this node. yes. i can't understand this point if i can make this arrow, mhm yeah you can make this arrow but as far as the tables go you have to figure out the properties of that arrow. um   uh huh ah  i mean this arrow is not in (just) not real arrow just a potential, potentially yeah well what what it means is if, that if you, have some information about one of these nodes that   if there is no evidence, mhm  uh huh uh huh yeah i can understand this one but you can but when this evidence is given this one and this one and (xx) dependent. they are dependent. be- because this one and this one are dependent  right so do you understand why this one and that one are dependent? uh huh. mhm mhm mhm and how about this one? this one and this one? they'll be they'll be dependent als- well no no no. i- if you know this is evidence then okay. there is only one evidence okay. yeah then these are dependent also because this is dependent through this one, through this one and then to that one. so  i want to know thi- it i- this node is dependent to this one? yes.   yeah uh huh so i mean th- th- the way to do this is to follow chains through the network. um so when you have this as evidence now you have a chain that goes from there to there. mhm mhm um um if uh i want to know the dependence property's transitive, i mean A and B are depen- A is dependent to B uh huh yeah you should be able to um... or i want to know the symmetry property. A is dependent to B and B is dependent to A right? yeah.   uh huh    mhm mhm  uh in the in the previous example (in) the discussion section, mhm? mhm okay yeah uh huh that's good enough. yeah there is no, if_ in the case of there is no evidence. mhm those are independent yeah. because of this, this connection the two arrows going to that node and this is, um, so, the reason those two are independent is because, those two arrows going to that node which means that by rule three, if you have two ind- two parents going in like this then the two parents are independent of each other. okay. um i might_ i actually think (i have a mistake here) um, on this, okay well that was yeah the the minus-five was not for that whole_ um,  cuz i have (xx) um   yeah. so it's, plus five? yep i'll_ lemme keep it until   yeah yeah this this i think you can keep the minus-three but  alright. okay. okay yeah  yeah and and there's sort of_ i didn't know whether to leave the template in or not and i i,   yeah. i i put in the extra operator like what i used in the U-C POP planner software, okay right well the the operator_ U-C POP had this weird property that you had to specify, right  so actually (xx) i carefully added in those arguments after i'd done this part when i got to the next part, because i was afraid i'd lose points for not having them match. so   it didn't say_ well so so i took that to mean they had to match, ah i i understand um, i am feeling generous and so ordinarily i would say oh okay you can have that point but i know that there were two or three other people that did the same thing that lost the one point    okay     yeah. okay here's these i think problem set four was the great equalizer for people who had been working hard and making a few mistakes here and there and the people that had been not working that hard because everybody that didn't work that hard in problem set four made a bad grade. yeah so okay. doesn't look like (you need to) yeah but it seems like if, the probability of eight given one, and you also know that then you have the probability of eight given E-two, okay but then you have to know that eight E-one and E-two are given. okay so you can't say that. yeah  well so what you have to say instead is to say i mean this is equal to the probability of knowing both are true and this is just knowing that these two whether each one_ saying they're  right  yeah. i got it. good. and so i can't really appeal to a combining or uncombining i have to use some sort of, argument based on the axiom structures. yeah you you can't use_ y- don't use_ don't come up with your own new axioms if    okay yes. that was easy alright good? okay and you kept, okay you got my problem set with you? yep okay oh you're recording right now? shh, you'll be famous.  this is not for this class this is for a totally different class and they won't know who you are, unless you know him. what what is this for? this is for a linguistics thing so yeah it's for the English Language Institute.  uh, i i just wanna go through like the instruction if i'm doing right? okay. did you get my email? yeah  well n- so so like for the_ you got my email about the noisy-or? yeah yeah well i i forgot to print that one oh that's alright, the D-separation didn't change it just got bigger.  w- w- what got changed?     so that's okay just don't you know just_ i just wanted to send that out so that everybody before they actually did part four of the homework would look at it and make sure that they what, number A? for task four? yeah when you do the uh do you need or for num-  you (didn't ran) task four to look like look like this? you know you're supposed to get these right but you have to be able to get these based on these independent probabilities. so how are you gonna do that? i don't know work it  oh oh so  yeah because it's a lot easier to do the calculations. i see and in fact you don't have all the information you need there, to do anything but noisy-or because you don't have all of the combined conditional probabilities. well so we we just have to submit like this something like this? yeah mhm right yeah so these two are oh. and like here, number one, i can just uh say i break it down, and like i can say just finally y- y- you really need this like that, yeah mhm  mm and obviously you're gonna be writing insufficient at least once or else it wouldn't make sense to, have  oh and here, this is the way you want it right?   and then w- and then what's  (and nothing, of) right well so so in the the D-separation table i was just giving you a whole bunch of different examples. oh   okay  well, i don't know is it? uh, no find like here it's like smaller but this is like, a lot bigger right but the arrows were also pointing in different directions in some cases. so this is a very different network. very different from this one mm. so like... mm. well so if you want you can just redraw things so you can say, you know if this is node two and this is node four, and this is node one, then you could pretend that's node three. right? so i mean you're still ignoring these connections you have to follow those through also, but basically you look through and you say is there a connection from this node to this node? so you first would follow this path and say well, is this a connection or is there something that D-separates those? so you'd say well this doesn't D-separate it because you have this as evidence. and since you don't have allergy as evidence, this by rule two, would be separated only if allergy were evidence. so, there's no way to separate itch from punched-in-stomach using those three rules. if by this path they were separated, then you would need to go up this path, and say are they separated this way? because they're not separated if there's at least one path, that you can follow and say nope this isn't separated nope that isn't separated nope that isn't separated. oh so like go here, match if yeah  i see oh. and and this, this meant uh this and this right? right. oh okay like here i i don't get uh, what what noisy, or is. okay so what noisy-or is is you are, approximating... um, get get these again, get these off the web page. that is what that email was about. um. so noisy-or is basically when you g- are given, probabilities only in terms of one of the causes, you try to have some way to combine them. so, what this is saying is, would it make sense to model yeah you_ i would say yes. well, why? because uh, this uh, depends on one of these four? well so it does depend on one of those four but um... does it make sense to combine the four independently? mm oh because these are independent, of each other? oh so if there was a some connection these the- you wouldn't (have) uh use uh, noisy-or? well you still can, you still can? mkay  mhm so so you could still use or, if there was something connection here? well i mean you can always use noisy-or because you can ignore everything else because you have these simple tables. but when you have things connected it's harder to consider them to be independent. so in this case um do you have dependencies between the three uh, four?  and then see are they independent or dependent? looks like they're independent. that's what it looks like yeah if you don't know abdominal pain. so maybe in this case that wouldn't be a problem for noisy-or. hm? okay so, you don't have these direct connections then in this network right? yeah i- it looks like these are independent. mkay, so, that's one of the factors that you might want to consider for noisy-or, and, another one is the fact that you don't know tha- that these four causes are not complete, is is   not looking at these? right. yeah. so i- if this_ th- it's saying these won't cause_ that these won't cause this?   yeah  so if you knew that, when you weren't under stress that you w- also wouldn't get punched in the stomach, yeah (okay) okay (xx)  uhuh? yep. mhm... yeah so is that the way the network changes? yeah. mhm. okay these are independent? right.  noisy-or makes a lot of sense because they're not related to  right. so were you using noisy-or for that? mm i mean the noisy-or what are you calculating with that? you're calculating things invo- involving (sun- sunset. that's not sunset.) so so i should use noisy-or here and then, not noisy-or here. use for sunsets um... it would be a good idea to use this set and noisy-or noisy-or? yeah because the parents are um independent. in fact it recommends that you use noisy-or somewhere doesn't it? yeah here  and you said yep,  even though these are connected, yeah. well if you have the official permission to do it then it's okay to  yeah. it_ you wouldn't get any wrong answer? not_ no because i mean you could even write on your homework you can say it said it was okay to use noisy-or for this problem so, you know cuz it would be it would be too hard to like yeah.  like an app- it's an app- approximation yeah it's an approximation. so what i was saying is it's a better approximation, if the parents are independent. but you can still use it as an approximation anyway. it just might not be as accurate if if the various parents' values, probability values are independent of each other. okay. so i could i could just say, if you want a, like exact answer you wouldn't use_ you wouldn't_ you shouldn't use noisy-or. that's certainly true. that probably is not enough of an  it's not? but i mean, what_ thes- these are the things_ the things we were talking about or the things that you want to talk about are, um what happens if these parents aren't the only causes, what happens if they're connected to each other. so, you know, choose an answer so i should find out if these are connected  what this means? wha- what uh the fact that these aren- four aren't the only causes discuss what that means, in terms of constructing a noisy-or, um,  right well you said you know you looked at those and you said well there are other ways to get abdominal pain then allergy stress cancer and punched-in-stomach. so, given that there are other ways, would noisy-or make sense? read in the book. it okay oh i see. for part B?   yeah just (xx) mhm. yeah  oh. i see. well thank you. sure.  i have evidence that that email was slowly disseminating but that the server's being so slow that it may take it hours to get there. okay. um, i'm assuming that given this piece of information our answer should change from the first one.   that sounds pretty good. um, the reason for the first one is there's no way to get, that_ you wanna need to give an H? mhm mkay okay. well, you wanna_ y- you don't wanna, go about this way. you wanna you wanna go about it by saying, is it sufficient not is it insufficient. um so what does what does this statement tell you? this, all this, is doing is telling me something about, rewriting it this way.   yep... mhm. so if that's independent   oh yeah because knowing the outcome of E-two won't affect it,  exactly and tha-   can rewrite this as just P-E-two, mhm maybe  i know that... um... i don't know any of these three. so i can't be using this one and have to be using this one. mhm and look at part one, those look kind of familiar don't they? ah yeah i mean tha- that was the key is to say what happens when you know that those are independent. okay. but still for the last one... one of these two, and the P-H, i still would need this one, which i don't know, oh wait. so if i know this, then i just know, this. (probability of E-one is) probability of E-two right? mhm no so what is the probability of E-one? try to write that down in terms of stuff that you have there. the probability of E-one? yep. but  well it is but you don't have that so you're gonna have to write it in terms of something a little more complicated. it'd have to be in terms of something i know, yep mhm. well, what is... so can you write the probability that you want in terms of the probability that you want given H? sure. mkay. i_ oh no i can't because there's always_ probability of E-one you're always going to have an H given E-one over an E-one given H. okay lemme lemme see the textbook for a minute i think you're... did we finish the homework (xx) (xx) okay. what were you wanting to look up? um well pretty much these are the three things that i have to work with. this is the one that i was looking up. um well i mean so this is an obvious one but, let's see, let's let's see what's available there again. so, you have the probability that E-one and E-two, s- which in this case is equal to the probability of E-one times the probability of E-two cuz they're independent right? mhm huh. i musta missed that (rule.) so are you using probability of A and B equals the probability of A given B (xx) talk louder. right well well now i hafta, hafta rewrite my, original statement. i'm looking for, the probability of H given E-one and E-two. mhm mhm mhm (those) the_ wait those denominators are equal? sure. probability of E-one given E-two is the same as the probability of E-two given E-one? if they're, independent. no no no no, no. this is the probability of E-one and this is the probability of E-two, right? if they're independent you  oh. okay... okay. so, you can figure out from these, what the probability of E-one and what the probability of E-two is right? (well) i'm not so sure now let me just work on it a little bit  i kind of don't see. alright go off and see if you can calculate those two first and then that might help. hello. just let me get some uh orange soda, (and then,) i'll be right with you. okay. there's no one here where is everyone? i mean like there's lots of four-ninety-two people here but, at the beginning of the term there were lots of office hours now. okay. uh, can you explain a little bit of (uh reasons) okay. yeah yeah i mean, okay for number, uh (xx) two and five uh two and five?   okay yeah but, there's no paths here, cuz it's it   well it's important, but... for example if four were evidence, then one and two are not independent anymore because, rule three only applies if, node four, is not evidence. yeah but i mean, now three is evidence. but  not directly, but, the idea is that if node two and node one are dependent, and node one and node five are dependent, then node two and node five are dependent also. because there is a direct path, between them.  well so i mean that you can follow and say node two is dependent on four node four is dependent on node six node six is dependent on whatever's below it. so you can follow a path between node two and node eight,  mhm okay so, what, do you mean by path by paths?  okay. uhuh yeah. okay okay mhm okay mhm alright then, okay, so, so, if when you when you said uh, node two is dependent on node one, which means if you know node one, you will know node two. it doesn't mean you'll know node two it means that that may affect the probability of node two, because when you have these tables you're gonna have_ you might have a table that says node two, um, well, if you know node four, then okay. okay. so because, say there was a hundred percent probability that node four would be true, mhm okay. okay so now say, you know the value of four, say it's true, and you also know the value of one, say it's false. mhm mhm okay. okay okay.  ye- w- well if you w- can apply the rule that means it's independent. independent. yeah. so how about this uh, this one, uh if, given node four, given node   yeah  you can apply rule one.  they are independent? right. and why, it's not here. well it's not here because i only had spec- if you noticed that i'm i'm only looking at part, this woulda been a huge chart if i'd done everything. okay  uhuh so  from node five no. because from node five, you connected all the way down to node four, mhm mhm mhm how about eight? so eight, the path is_ does exist there because since you know node four, uhuh mhm uhuh okay so so now, one and two, are dependent, so you can go five three one four two eight. one and two are, dependent. right. because, the only way they could be independent is if you could apply one of these rules. okay so, this rule is for independent. yeah. okay. so now given four one and two are dependent. th- yeah. uhuh whereas if you didn't know four, one and two would be independent. okay. so given four these two are dependent, but, mhm right because of rule one. because rule two, or rule one? rule ru- well, six and seven are independent of each other but five is independent from six and seven. no i mean six and seven are yeah. they're independent   okay. alright. alright i i have another question about this tree... so i actually this table, like this number point-nine means uh, the probability of on-time given,  right? mhm so, well, if i want to calculate this, on-time and health given no accident, mhm you shouldn't, do what? i mean, how to calculate this. do i need to have point-seven here, or not? yeah but, break that down first. no i mean, if, my question is i di- i don't know if i should have, point-seven here or not? okay do you have your example from class? did you take notes in class, when, mm, no i i mean i i'm just confused cuz, given no-accident, these two should be independent. yeah, uhuh right? mhm so, i should have this, i think, the probability of this is just, point-nine times point-six. no no no no because, you're given no-accident, well o- well s- so are you given no-accident, which task are you doing? mm, i'm trying to doing task one but i want to      i just want to calculate  so, should i have, point-seven here? no no no no, no you don't need point-seven here  right. yeah. mhm yeah, um, right no no no no i mean, this one's not, no-acci- uh, you have accident so not no-as- accident. well so but it's true if then  mhm i think both, should be equal, cuz, if you have two like, two say A and B and you say the probability of A given B plus probability A given not-B should be equal to the probability of A. yeah, but  no why not? because you have to, here you're you're saying you're given no-accident, here you're saying you're given no-accident, but, you're not given no-accident, these two, event are, uh independent. no they're not independent if you have no accident then you can't have no-accident. these ones not  that's my point, so they're so they're dependent. they're not independent. okay. well, what this is confusing cuz you're saying not no-accident but oh well. yeah. i mean, is this right? is this equations right? no. why not? this equation should be, i think it's right. no, it's not.     if this one equal to this one? no. it's not. so i'm writing this down so that you can look at it, and compare them. okay. okay. alright. yeah i'll    yeah yeah,  mhm   i know what you mean. okay. yeah. alright, so. and...  yeah  uhuh okay so, if any one of these uh, is sufficient in, part A,  yeah. yeah. mhm.  right. okay. yeah. cuz in part B what you can say is, it was sufficient i- in part A and i know extra stuff so th- therefore it's gonna be suf- sufficient here. okay. and (the) problem,   yeah, uhuh. so, and they say, it's true so you can apply noi-  uhuh mhm yeah, i mean and  yeah. mhm. but if you have, your individual tables here, you can have the,  what no i mean  if, if you can not apply noisy-or, your tables, sh- shouldn't be like these. no. no if you can't apply noisy-or then this doesn't make any sense. this was just an example of the mathematics behind applying noisy-or this is not telling you when you can and when you can't use it. why not, i mean well i mean so, this is_ uh there's no commentary here this is just saying these are tables this is what you get if you use noisy-or. but this is not telling you, whether it makes sense to combine these probability tables, using the noisy-or. but if you cannot use, noisy-or the formula shouldn't,  mhm yeah so can i say, uh, if, all of these three nodes are independent, to, each other, then, you can  how about if you have another node D here. can you apply   um, if you don't have one of those tables for node E, mhm but, you know they are independent. you do- don't have table (rather) you know that this node (are) independent. right. so you want to leave some of the probability left over for this node E right? but, i mean, so, you should still be able to apply noisy-or but you want to use some of the terminology in the book in that case because, if these aren't the only causes then what does that mean? how can you explain away the fact that you don't have, all of the, all of the causes? so basically just, write a paragraph that says, i can or can't use noisy-or, this is why, and, why being the dependencies, and, what does it mean t- that there may be other causes. okay okay  yeah.  yeah okay. mhm (alright) thanks. sure. okay. i still couldn't, prove, that, that they were, for part B doing this one, mhm kay okay, but can you get P of E-one can you get P of E-two? oh. P of E-one (would) be... no, you can't. because to get i would need P of, H given E-one, or P of H or_ and P of H given E-two and i don't have either of those. otherwise i could get it. mkay let me_ i'm i'm buying into your algebra let me look at the solution and make sure that, they're not doing something that i can't think of. is this the solution for the book? no no no. oh. okay. no this is the uh, every other homework i always keep the answers with me because, this is not my homework so, oh. did (Sun) write this one? yeah. well,  there are two ways you can get to it. you can break up, probability of H given E-one and E-two this way, yeah. mhm mhm  yeah i don't think your (hand) (xx) um, i don't know. okay yeah. that's, that's all that matters. i'm probably getting the same thing you are. i get_ no matter how i do it i get, probability of E-one times probability of E-two in the denominator. yeah. i'm getting the same thing. and you just don't have that. so, okay, i'll send some email to (Sun,) and uh i i would write what you found, and if i find out something different i'll send you email. mkay. it looks like (she's in line.)   S K T I M at EECS. at EECS. okay. (hey) hello hey, um, for problem three, uh this is_ this number is what i got from the computer using Java, uhuh okay for, this is the one you calculated? no this one i got um, from computer  right. (on the task three) part A? A this is A B C. (none of them are correct?) oh yeah the answer has something different but i think there's a okay oh. but this one should be right right? if_ yeah if your network has been comp- been entered in Java correctly that one should be right. so none of these are correct. well no i this is oh okay so uhuh okay mhm how about this one, uh maybe if i can get this one right then (probably) this one, will be right. (right?) for part four? yeah um, i mean part four you're using a different_ slightly different model right because you're incorporating that additional, oh yeah okay okay i will check that out and see which one is right okay um i mean i can go through and do these calculations again,  yeah, w- is there anybody waiting? if there's nobody waiting i'll i'll_ i brought a calculator today, for just such an emergency. just a quick question, this is yes or no so it doesn't take any time. okay. come in here so they can hear. oh. quick question does this, abdominal pain carry over in the next one so you now have two things of evidence or is this the only thing of evidence? oh um abdominal pain is there too, so_ cuz it says additional evidence. okay. okay, so, here we go. i think i found... an error  yep this this answer that she got was right before there was one of the intermediate steps that wasn't right. so, s- so neither of them is right. that's correct. (okay) (xx) (calculation but) i don't  this is right. that's pretty close to right yeah. that's at least_ the the second decimal place so the point-eight part is right for part C. but the second decimal place looks a little off. okay but i think i found my one error i thought this is um, this should be, reversed, (xx) okay. thank you. sure. can i ask you some questions? sure. okay. um, just to make sure i'm doing this right, mhm mhm mhm mhm independent if that's evidence or independent if that's not evidence? if it's not evidence right  dependent.  so, these are dependent, these are dependent, these are dependent, yep mhm right. mhm right. mhm right. that's correct yeah. so part A (ends the) answer's kind of scary but, it's, not okay. and then, i guess if i'm thinking about it right i should have this, correct i think. but, in in the case where these are both evidence, then these, two would be independent if this is evidence, mhm mhm right. but you have to be careful about the uh the rash one. the rash one right. yeah yeah what do you mean both ways? mm okay. eat-fish is, independent, of punched-in-stomach. via that path yes. which means that bad breath since coming from here would also be independent. yeah. but i- they have to be independent on all the paths so now you have that punched-in-stomach via allergy is independent of eat-fish and bad breath. but is, eat-fish independent of punched-in-stom- stomach if you come this way. not via rash. okay. is it not? mm, not. wait. is this independent of this? right.   um, let's see... um, i'd say it would be. mkay yeah. mhm, mhm okay. okay (then.) um, and, i, worked out, the um, the task four with th- um, the noisy-or, mkay yeah uhuh, that's good uhuh mhm right, mhm yeah. yeah, okay i w- i woulda thought that you went the other way. oh. okay i think is, i think it's exac-  okay. mhm so and then the one_ i mean it's easy to check the ones that are just individually true because you can just look at the table and say uh right. yeah. (i got it.) yeah okay. that sounds right. okay. so, okay. uh... okay, yeah that's gonna be (good) enough. okay thank you. sure. hi. you ready to get on tape too?  mkay. yeah mhm  this is dependent_ or these should be both dependent on this, mhm yeah well is this one dependent on that? should be yeah. okay. since this one's dependent on that one that one's dependent on that one that one's dependent on that then, it is. this is evidence. well so, but but yeah. so th- the point is can you follow a chain, all the way to punched-in-stomach, and so you have that stress, is dependent on punched-in-stomach. so, so (is) this way? so that one is also. so i know y- if this, this point R (that if it sends) some nodes (xx) this is one is uh, dependent on this. that one's dependent on that yeah mhm right. oh this one you mean the arrow, points  yeah i guess so mhm yeah alright right, yeah this is dependent on what? so this is dependent well so these are dependent on each other, yeah (to b- )  cuz i don't know when it sh- where it bloke broke or where it's it is not well if you were_ if you knew stress is evidence,  midterm would not be connected to abdominal pain if yeah alright. okay but y- in this case these, these two are not those two are not dependent on each other.  they are because you're getting evidence cuz they, oh okay so basically for this this chain is (xx) is that a guess or have you worked through it,  okay. that's that's the case but but i just wanted to make sure you'd work through it. yeah, so i don't, i'm not sure if this one is dependent on this yeah mhm  mm, but i i mean it's it's simple but, th- the answer is not all of them in part B. y- yeah. this one must be, independent of this one. mhm, mhm that's right mhm why is that blocked? this is evidence. yep, mhm so it's blocked from there but it's not blocked from here, ah yeah why, why it's rule thr- oh rule three said if this is evidence this_ these  yeah. yeah uhuh   and you have to decide, well so if rash is dependent on this punched-in-stomach, (just w-) s- s- ah, so this one is dependent on this one this one is dependent on this one. right. but but well so then the question is... is this one dependent on that one? that's the key is stress dependent on eat-fish? stress dependent on eat-fish... (xx) (depends) don't say that. yeah this is uh joke, ar-ar. and that's the  um i don't know is it broken? well l- look at this, versus the rules that you have. this is this... uh, uh, so r- rule says only when there's two other nodes,   but if there's no nodes down there then rule three can still apply. oh, okay so this, this one is, so this one is blocked? yep yep. and you're missing one. this one. yep. and that one too right? this one is blocked? maybe. think about it. is it? i mean, y- you'r- you're gonna ha_ go off and think about that one i don't want to tell you the whole answer, go off and think about that one. (xx) (oh i sh-) okay.   the the first one is just we say, when we apply, that (xx) that what what's the name of that rule Bayes' rule? Bayes' rule and the you have to apply Bayes' rule yeah  yeah. mhm. so i figure out only this (makes it.) okay. you still have to do part B but yeah. uh, okay. okay thank you. sure. um... he's back yeah.  the D-separation was giving me trouble before. mkay mhm good sure they are. you want them to block right so now all of a sudden i mean if you just look locally eat-fish and itch are blocked right by rule one? that doesn't help you much here cuz i didn't wanna tell you the answer. right well the thing that confuses me is, and this confused me in lecture, seeing that sometimes you treated it as if there were an arrow pointing that way and sometimes you didn't. mm, you shouldn't treat it like there's an arrow  well you don't want a chain if there's no chain that means they're independent. i mean think about it if you had two networks that had no connections between them then those two networks are gonna be i- independent even though none of these rules apply. right but... it just seems like this is going to be so think in terms of those three rules still. so,  mhm how it's going to depend on anything? yeah. well you just said everything depended on it. um  kay sure you do. you know the independence you know this one is not independent of that one, you know this one's not independent of that one. you know that it doesn't matter for this one because you're given that one as evidence. yeah there are too many double negatives floating around okay. so, i think the key here is for me to tell you, well no, the key is uh, do it on a different network so i well do you have the example from the web, with you? um the one you did in class, you mean? yeah. mhm okay. let's go there so that at least someone will use it. you can run Netscape off here? it wouldn't let me do it. i logged in elsewhere to start it up. hm maybe i answered the first one too hastily without actually knowing no. you may have gotten lucky on that one but, it is kind of good for you to know because i guarantee you there'll be some of this on the exam because this is one of those fast things that, are good exam questions because, you don't have to do all the calculation. right so i mean the the simplest case is if you know node three then one nodes one and  sure it is  okay but they're not, they're not individual nodes. huh? well that doesn't matter. i mean if they were individual nodes it would still be the same application of rule three. right  so i mean the idea is that the rules are applied in the same way. so, here, i mean you can look at the network locally and you can say, um, eat-apples is independent, of the stuff down here, because allergy b- breaks the chain between eat-apples and the stuff   oh, okay right that, i understand that   that's a simple example because you can't really divide anything in this  these two can be divided right and that's the whole network i mean you're dividing, i mean, y- when you know allergy and you know that this connection is broken because you know allergy, then you're also dividing, stuff out based on that right? you mean like, consider it breaking it right there and there? yeah, mhm. so this is independent of that mhm right. well you can say they're all dependent right well yeah but  mhm. so now, since i've worried about all that, i just have this part of the network left. mhm what do you mean it's out? i was going to say this, is broken here but it's   yeah mhm okay does that help? no it doesn't. actually yeah it makes this independent of that. huh? i mean, it makes this dependent, oh no it doesn't cuz that breaks a link too, yeah, it makes this conditionally independent of that. mm yeah mhm mhm yeah, mhm mhm yeah that may actually hurt you later but yeah you can do that   independent i mean? yep mhm okay but how does that, how does collapsing this hurt me later then? well i do- i don't know that it will i'm just thinking about all the rest of this stuff for example i mean if i've reduced it so that there's only one arrow, combining two evidence  i can't do that with these here, but  well that's (what) i'm saying and since i've showed that, when i broke it here, and then i've showed that these are all conditionally dependent. right right right, but but the point is if you're, actually physic- if if you're making these one node, then that means that the arrows into this one, combined node include this one this one that one that one and that one. mhm okay but if i leave them as two nodes then i can't say that these two are independent by_ or conditionally dependent because of rule (one) well yes you can why? this arrow is going in the wrong direction well no d- all you have to do is to say, that by rule two, this one and that one are independent. because this is part of set X and that's part of set Y. oh the fact that this is an evidence node doesn't change that. no. no that doesn't change for these it just changes for all of the things in the center so, can i mark? sure. all of these, have to be specifically evidence or not evidence but the ones out here, okay which could have any number of  okay that's what i didn't understand but i mean it also matters for these child nodes here if you have evidence of one of the child nodes for rule three then rule three doesn't apply anymore. okay, so this is rule two saying that these two are conditionally independent, yeah so like here since you have this one as evidence rule three does not split those two anymore. okay. but then, i guess i jumped ahead by saying this was conditionally independent of that, because knowing this is independent, of that_ oh this is part of yeah, that's oh okay. it did mean something it meant that you didn't have to go back and look at it again well it didn't help me, for this though yeah it did because, there's two ways to get over to all these nodes. there's this way which you've shown is conditionally independent, so you can break the network here, which simplifies it a lot, and you can effectively ignore this this link here. mhm oh, okay  yeah mhm mhm yeah mkay mhm yeah nope no because it doesn't make sense if you already know abdominal pain then it doesn't matter, how you model it because you know what it is. so, actually you shouldn't assume you have evidence for part C. okay. and in assuming eviden- no evidence for part C, i can again break this, sure, mhm yeah. s- which is one of the prerequisites for noisy-or. i mean uh the point is you don't know what you have as evidence so it's possible that you might have rash as evidence... okay right i wrote since we don't have rash as evidence, yeah right but if you had, rash as evidence then, okay right. i'm assuming no evidence. okay.   oh. well  mhm. okay. other causes are independent? what do you mean? that the other causes are independent of each other and that they're all listed. there are no  well you could always introduce a (link) node there  okay. the cure-all. yeah exactly. but it never hurts to say too much in these things. okay. it just makes the graders work harder.  okay. thanks. hello um, for the uh, the task two, um is this part right? i mean, for the first one there's (none.) mhm yeah it looks pretty good to me. um f- how about C, because i think they are connected so it was not, not (model) well um... so, there are a couple things that you're not mentioning which_ are you assuming that you have no evidence? because what oh  okay so i have to take that into account yeah mhm mhm now lemme lemme look to make sure that_ lemme compare because there's probably some number somewhere that how about how about the first (stack?) the first (stack) combined is two evidence right? uhuh okay uhuh okay  this is oh my god. okay. and oh wa- wa- wait mm so i should so this is this is the false, okay   um, so for this part thi- this (xx) are the same right? yeah mhm. (okay i'll do it again) that's why i said the_ i- in discussion i was like, it helps to c- look at the numbers over and over again or compare it with something. yeah eh,  i dunno i guess so. things seem to be uh slowing down a bit so, alright okay. um 	1
LEL215SU150.json	okay, uh while we (xx) um recover the technology, um, what i wanna do today, uh is to continue on obviously through our rapid tour, of Roman history from the foundation of the city, down to the reign of Augustus. um, again you will find a few of the names that i am mentioning and going on about, uh also figure on your list, for this Friday, uh for the quiz, again as j- just to repeat there will be ten short answer questions taken off of that list. uh we'll take say the last twenty-five or so minutes of lecture to do it maybe, uh a little bit longer, um, just to go through it quickly i mean the names and concepts, on that list are of course, fairly central to things that i have been talking about, uh here in lecture and it will, uh enable me to, uh see how, things are going. um, what i wanna do today, as well, uh is, technology permitting, uh to have a look at, this object which is called H-double-oh-two, uh and linked to the web page for today's, session. uh this document is, the political testament essentially, uh of the emperor Augustus. uh and it is really a key statement, uh as to what made the Roman monarchy work. also as you browse this document uh which has a tendency to show up on hour exams on a regular basis, uh not to be completely unsubtle. um, the, you know you will see that it has a lot of notes attached to it. and, um get into the habit of clicking on notes on this web page, uh when you are doing assignments later on in the term which are based on, uh documents which are taken off this web page, the notes will really, i hope help you a very great deal, figure out what's going on. um, ancient documents uh as we have seen and as you've read indeed in the Literary Texts and the, Roman Historian are very tricky things. uh they are not simple stenographic records of anything. they are very carefully composed, with a point to them. um, and they will... be designed to tell a quite particular story. and there is perhaps no way, uh or no document that we have in the ancient world, uh which tells a story in a more complex way, uh than does, uh the tale of Augustus, um in this text which is H-double-oh-two, okay now let's see if we can find it. 	1
COL425MX075.json	maybe i'll take this opportunity while the uh light bulb is getting changed to um, welcome you all on behalf of the Environmental Faculty Steering Committee to the last of this semi- uh this semester's seminars in the series Research in the Interest of the Public and the Environment. this is a series that, is about environmental challenges and their interdisciplinary s- solutions from the perspective of faculty and students at the University of Michigan. the seminar series is sponsored by, the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Urban Environmental Management Institute. before i, uh mention today's speakers and their title let me say that this seminar series will continue into the next term. the first of the seminars next term will be January thirteenth that's also a Thursday afternoon, the seminars next term will run from four to six instead of from three to five. they will all be held in the Michigan League, uh not all in the same room but all in um one of two of the nice seminar rooms over there and we will have a um, a schedule set by the time of the first meeting. and the first, uh seminar next semester will feature a group of, faculty and uh graduate students who are designing an energy track for, the University of Mini- Michigan that will involve collaboration among, about half-a-dozen units across campus. by an energy track, i mean a program in research and education at all levels and outreach. it focuses on, the, sources, uses, of energy, alternative energies, the problems created by energy use for both technologies and for society. so this is a very interesting, um subject that has been the s- uh, that has been the focus of several informal meetings over this, fall, and we'll hear about that f- uh for, we'll hear about that in January. today we have, uh, this, the theme of sustaining agriculture, and our speakers are John Vandermeer of the Department of Biology and Ivette Perfecto of the School of Natural Resources and Environment. the title of their talk is Challenging Old Assumptions about Agriculture and Finding the Ecological Bases for New Forms of Production. okay thank you Katherine. um, what we plan to do here, i don't know if i can get out of the way of this or not, but, what we plan to do here is uh i'll talk for a little bit, um, about sort of the underlying theoretical framework that we think we're operating under here, and then when i finish that, that'll just be about five minutes or so, and then i'll talk about the work that we're doing in Nicaragua, and when I finish talking about the work that we're doing in Nicaragua, why Ivette will talk about the work that we're doing in Mexico, and then finally when fe- she finishes why i'll come back up here talk uh, um a little bit s- more reflective about how the, uh theoretical framework fits into the work that we're doing and we'll be planning to do in the future and how other people might be, might b- uh be wanting to join us, okay? so, first of all, i guess the first thing that we have to talk about is why agriculture at the University of Michigan. the University of Michigan is an, ivory tower school uh, it's not Michigan State we're not the cow college obviously, we really shouldn't be doing agriculture. um, and so we have to justify that to some extent i suppose um, besides the fact that most of the terrestrial surface of the earth is agroecosystem, whether y- people like to admit that or not, um the truth is that the modern agricultural system, when i talk about the modern agricultural system i'm principally talking about the agricultural system that has evolved since World War Two. uh, that agri- modern agricultural system has been in fact and and everyone has to admit it, cornucopian, i mean we now produce more than enough food for every person, a- way more than enough food for everyone in the world. as a matter of fact the principle problem with agriculture right now is over- overproduction, um, so it has been cornucopian and in that sense very successful, but successful in very narrow terms. along with that success has come kind of a Faustian bargain, that people are beginning to realize now, or a lot of, lot of people are realizing uh strongly at the present time, and that Faustian ba- bargain has to do with the problems that agricultural is cau- er- agriculture is causing. this is first highlighted by Rachel Carson in her book Silent Spring. which is sometimes, sometimes cited as the, uh the beginning of the modern environmental movement, and you'll recall that that book was mainly about agriculture as a matter of fact about pesticides. and more recently we have been seeing, the human use. and second of all we need to get away from this narrow, traditional, uh this narrow technical specialization, where uh people are cubbyholed into their particular disciplinary units. and we have to get out_ agroecosystems involve all sorts of different disciplines, and so by very, by its very nature the ecological approach to studying agro- agroecosystems, is going to be and needs to be by the very nature a interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary, uh approach. so, this this focus that we're, we're trying to develop here is an ecological focus where we're looking at agricul- agri- an agricultural an agroecol- an ecological approach to agroecosystems, at multiple scales in multiple disciplines. okay? that's the background. now, let me show you some slides to talk about the Nicaragua work that we've been doing, and i will definitely n- need the lights out as ne- as much as i can get because my slides will not withstand a lot of light pollution. no, i think we   Costa Rica? Sri Lanka? is any of this uh protected, reserve? okay. okay, i think i need to change the is can you change that for me? okay, well you can see now, or begin to see that our, more general theme, a- of both uh John's research and my research, is related to the interaction between agriculture and natural areas, or between agricultural activities and conservation activities. and that is illustrated also with this other project. can i have, are you, okay with doing this? yeah. i'll do it. you got about, fifteen minutes. fifteen minutes? okay, so that's that's when we decided to, that it was time to, uh move on from Costa Rica and go to Mexico, can i have the next one? and, so we started this project in Mexico just about a year-and-a-half ago. and uh, this is, here is a map of Mexico, we're in Chiapas, which is the southern part of Mexico. and uh, and so this is the state of Chiapas. and within Chiapas we're working i- very close to the frontier with uh Guatemala here, and so in this whole area which is called the Soconusco region is one of the primary coffee-growing regions, of Mexico. now, why go to Mexico? it's several reasons. first of all, it's one of the most impo- coffee is one of the most important crops in Mexico. it's the second uh most important, uh generator of of uh of income in Mexico after, petroleum. ch- coffee overall in the world is the second most traded como- commodity after petroleum. so it's a it's a very important economically, it's a very very important crop. and in Mexico it's extremely important, and it has been very important for many years. next one? it's also, uh Mexico also didn't have a very strong program for technification. so, what you find in Mexico is a lot of areas that, uh a lot of coffee plantations that are shaded plantations, and also because the topography where coffee is grown, at least in this region, in in uh in Chiapas, the topography is uh so steep that there are many areas that cannot be cultivated, at all. so you have a lot of fragments of forest distributed throughout the whole area, throughout the whole coffee-growing region. things that wait- some in some cases it's uh small fragments that are there to protect the watershed, and in other cases it's just because it's, it's just impossible to cultivate, to, because it's so steep. people cannot get there to harvest the coffee so they just leave leave it in in the natural forest. next one? in addition to that uh, e- about eighty percent of the coffee plantations, of the coffee farms in Mexico are manage, are small farms, less than five hectares. so, if you develop a program that will benefit the producers, it will tend to benefit more people if uh, in Mexico than in other places like in El Salvador, that's uh there are a lot of large, producers. and also about sixty percent of the population in Mex- in- that produces coffee, in Mexico are indigenous people, as well. can i have, uh, the next one? the other thing uh, important about Mexico is that they have the most, important market of organic coffee. and most of these, these are the different organic coffee cooperatives. they are all cooperatives. primarily of indigenous people that have organized themself, and they have develop strategies to market their coffee directly. because in most cases you market your coffee through intermediaries. and so the farmer, the producer ends up receiving a very minuscule part of uh what the, what what you pay here for a cup of coffee. uh, in Mexico, for a whole variety of reasons, people have organized really well. producers have organized really well, and have taken advantage of the uh increase in the organic market, and they are they are marketing their coffee as organic coffee and they have these cooperatives that have become very very efi- efficient. and so you already have kind of an infrastructure there social infrastructure, that could help if you're trying to, in addition to do organic coffee. do something like shade-grown coffee, certified shade-grown coffee that people will receive a higher, price for their production. can i have the next one? and another thing that attract us to, to Mexico, of course was uh that as you know in nineteen ninety-four there was a, eh an insurrection of uh, indigenous people there, the Zapatista insurrection. this is a poster in San Cristobal de Las Casas that say, mhm. that's all Finca Irlanda? this is all Finca Irlanda, this is a small fo- this i- i'm sorry, this is all Finca Irlanda here, uh and this is, here, is a small forest fragment. there's another forest fragment here. and so what we're doing, what we did last summer was to sample the ants in the forest and then also sample ants a different distance from the fragment in Finca Irlanda, which is what we consider high-quality matrix because it has a lot of trees, very diverse, very dense shade. and then in the other side of the forest fragment, there's another plantation which have a much lower density of shade trees and is a much more intensive plantation. so we're looking at, at a very small scale, we're trying to look at these landscape level phenomenons. can i have the next one? and so we have for example, this is the reserve it's about fifteen hectare uh big, and then these are the plots that we- where we sample the ants, inside the reserve, in Finca Hamburgo which is more intensive, and in Finca Irlanda, which is less intensive. and, just to give you some, preliminary results here, all the black dots are Finca Irlanda, and all the white dots are Finca Hamburgo, and there is a significant difference in terms of uh, the diversity that you find, but also there is a significant decrease in diversity as you go away from the forest. this is distance from the forest. so as you go away from the forest in Finca Irlanda you have a significant, uh decrease. uh, Finca Irlanda is what we're considering the high-quality matrix. and they, the difference was not significant, or the the regression was not significant for, for the other farm, but that's because the drop occurs at very close distance from the forest. so you really have, and we actually had some, some, uh very small-scale plots looking at the drop of diversity as you get out of the, away from the forest just the first the first, uh fif- uh twenty meters or fifty meters, or, i can't remember. but anyway, you you do see a very dramatic drop right at the beginning and then everything stays more or less the same. so that's that's one of the thing that we're beginning to look at. we're trying to get a grasp at the landscape-level issues as well. uh because if you're start looking at just you know the diversity in the farm, you're missing a big part of of what's going on in terms of preservation of biodiversity, at least in this region. can i have the next one? the next phase of the project is looking at the function of that diversity. what are these things doing in the coffee plantation and that's gonna be, for the next three years i think that's what we gonna be doing primarily is looking at, uh, in particular the effect of birds, the diversity and density of birds, most of them, uh many of them that are uh herbivores, and the diversity and density of ants and spiders what impact do they have on the herbivores of coffee? so, that's that's gonna be the next stage in in this research, and, next one? oh, these are these are ants eating, ants are also generally s- predators, so these are ants eating a caterpillar. and the last thing that i want to say, the last comment is related to, uh the overall picture. i think that one of the main thing that we should not do is lose perspective of, the farmer. the person who is making the decision as to whether to have shade or not have shade or or how much shade to have in these plantations, and when we start looking at a system like this, from a purely conservation perspective, what w- our conclusion will be, well let's have these very shaded plantations. i mean that that's the best thing. that's that's what preserve the most biodiversity and we have data that shows that those very shaded plantations are the best for preserving biodiversity, but it might not be the best for, the farmer. and so we need to look at uh, inclu- incorporate the farmer into this whole, um, decision, can i have the next one? one of the sa- let me, let me just go back there. can i just_ i'm sorry. okay can i have the lights please? oh. go ahead. um, it's not for you, John. what we, i'm not finished and you can't leave yet. um, we, we've shown you two specific examples okay and they're just, just two examples and they're examples of looking at sort of the fine-tuning level of particular aspects of an agroecosystem. um, what we what we what, going back to going back to the beginning, going back to the beginning where i was talking about the approach that we're taking, the agroecosystem, the industrial agroecosystem that we that we have in our in our midst today needs to be changed. and one of the reasons that we're making these studies is to understand how agroecosystems works in general because we're totally convinced that understanding at an ecological level, the details of how agroecosystems works i- is what we're going to need in order to be able to, effect change. but when we talk about effecting change, there are various models of effecting change that s- change themselves, and, the models that we have seen since the World War Two have been what, what i refer to as the auto-route models. and the the the the image that i have in mind here is a topographic map, and what we're aiming to do is get from one place to another on the topographic map, so we're here and we wanna get to point A. now, the one way we can get there is we can draw a straight line from here to there. and then we can go and we can dr- we can follow that straight line. if we're out in the woods following that straight line, we may have to climb down into gulleys scale up cliffs, and fall through through rivers and and swamps and everything like that in order to follow that straight line. or we can blast our way through and create an auto-route, um um um a s- a straight line that goes there. but that might not be the best way to do it. Best way to do it probably would be to look at the contours on the contour map and try and get a pathway along the contour to try and get from where we are now to the point over there. now metaphorically, of course, what i'm talking about is these contours are the ecology of the system. uh, agriculture occurs in the context of an ecosystem and that ecosystem creates these contours which, i believe and we believe they act as signposts to tell us where we can make this contour pathway to get from point A to point B. um, so the the the the model that we're working on for transformation here, is to be contrasted with the typical model, that's uh the the autoroute model to be contrasted with that is the contour-pathway model. now, in saying that, i definitely wanna say that we're rejecting any sort of romantic notions that what we should be doing is going back to back to nineteen thirty-nine, uh or back to the last century and the way they did agriculture in the last century. we're not talking about that at all. we're not talking about uh, eliminating all the scientific progress that has been made since that time. and we're not talking about eliminating or ignoring the scientific progress that has come since World War Two in, agroecosystems. indeed, we'd reject the notion that many, i think romantic uh, uh romantic uh, uh agroecologists have that we need to reject the scientific approach. rather we're seeing, we're saying actually we need more science we need more technology, it's a question of what kind of science and what kind of technology that we actually need. uh, the kind of science that we need, the kind of tech- the kind of technology that we need is, that kind of science and technology that enables us to see where these contours are where these ecological contours are. it enables us to see where the contours are so that we can gently, make a pathway through these contours. as opposed to the old model of dominating nature with the autoroute and blasting our way through to point B from point A, we need to gently make the pathway along the contours so that we can get to that other point. and to see these contours we need to approach the ecosystem as the complex system that it is. it is a complex system. and pros- approaching it with sort of this sort of brute force and i would say rather naive reductionist approach that many scientists approach it with, is simply not going to work. uh, we all believe in reductionism as a tactic of course, i'm talking about reductioni- reductionism as a philosophy. what we need to do is we need to have a thoughtful approach a creative and thoughtful approach to these very complex systems and- t- n- i- to understand them in that way. in putting those two things together emphasizing this gentle approach to finding the contour-pathway and the thoughtful approach towards the complex system reminds me of the comment by Richard Levins, uh that what we really need to approach here in in in aiming towards the transformation of the agroecosystem, is a technology which is not an old technology but a new technology as a matter of fact a more new technology tha- th- than the technologies that have emerged since World War Two. we're looking for a gentle, thought-intensive kind of technology to replace the sort of domineering, auto-route kind of technology that we've had in the past. so, with that, now you can applaud. any any sense how long it takes for re-diversification, uh in an area that's been pretty well, wiped out, does it, happen quite quickly again? well, i can a- answer in the in the case of Nicaragua i mean dep- it it looks to us like it depends on what the wiping out has been. it depends on what the kind of, what the damage has been. if it's a hurricane, uh, it's all very complicated because, in ten years now since the hurricane we have much more biodiversity than was there before the hurricane. that's a natural ecological process. what happens after agriculture we don't know this proj- this project that we had is just underway right now. our expectation is that the accumulation of biodiversity is gonna be larger in the traditional agroecosystem than it is in the other ones, although, you know so far initial results don't really show that. but we really don't know. we don't know. yeah? uh, just the graph that you have of four different ways to move from the forest and biodiversity, mhm? well, it depends on what, how you measure it, yeah mhm yeah if you, could give an incentive to a farmer in the States to diversify his crop, would you do that first of all, and second of all how would you do that? a farmer where? i'm sorry, in the States. in the States... uh, yeah, i would, i would, and i th- i think that, it's it's a very complicated issue because uh, there's uh all sorts of political and policy, uh, effects that a farmer make a decision based on uh, many many different factors. but i think that one of the problems that we have, like John mentioned at the beginning, one of the main problems in agriculture, and that's particularly true in the United State, if you read, you know the New York Times last Sunday or a couple of Sundays ago, they had a big article on farming in the United State, agriculture in the United State, and farmers are in big trouble. economic trouble. mainly because the price of corn and soybean is so low and the reason for that is because that there's such a high overproduction. so, my argument is well, if if that's the main problem, overproduction, then let's, achieve a lower production and diversify these systems. and have the farmer then at least have a a way to, that would give the farmer a little bit more of of you know a a way to avoid drops in prices and things like that because they will have a diversity of crops. now how farmers here in the United States are gonna react to that, obviously, right now the way policies are written and all that, is, there's no inc- incentive to do that kind of thing. the incentive right now is to produce as much as you can, in your plot, you know. fence-to-fence production as much as you can. and try to survive i think that i, yeah i w- i would like to add to that. i think you also have to look at what causes that. and that's caused largely by political decisions. i mean the large grain companies an- a as a matter of fact are making out like bandits on the whole thing. and they, the large grain companies through their lobbying efforts they were the ones who influenced the change in the legislation from what we used to have in the past supply management, where farmers were only basically allowed to or re- seemed to receive subsidies to plant a certain amount so that the supply of commodities on the market would be such that the price was set so that they could make a profit. that changed to encourage fence rail to fence rail planting, so that they actually forced to sell below the cost of production. and then the, subsidy comes to the farmer as a payment, to make up for the shortfall that the farmer has had. now who's actually benefitting from that whole thing, the large grain companies are benefitting like crazy because they get to buy corn and wheat at below the cost of production. which of course then translates it into the third world because they're not buying corn in way below the cost of production, and even farmers, peasant farmers in Mexico and Costa Rica cannot compete with the uh, with uh with farm grown in the United States because that farm is effectively, well, because the large grain companies are effectively subsidized by, our tax dollars. but it brings up another issue, which sh- that i- i'm sorry for going so long, such a long answer, but it it brings up another issue and this is something that Ivette and i have talked about quite a lot and that is the whole uh, this whole question of overproduction in coffee. i do recall several years ago, at a coffee conference that we went to in Costa Rica where there were coffee experts from all over the world, uh economists, agronomists absolutely_ well not agronomists really, but economists, sociologists, uh all people that dealt with coffee, production people, coffee um, yeah, uh uh a- actually with the with the complication of the Natural Academy of Science's piece on, i think that they called it sustainable agriculture, about four five years ago. um, they really talked about traditional methods of, uh diversifying agricultural production for the family farmer in in the United States and, so i think i w- the the the theme is out there, about mhm, yes. mhm well that's a very important question, and currently goi- to going back to Costa Rica, currently the, all of the coffee in Costa Rica is harvested by migrant Nicaraguan workers. but then also i i thought that part of your question was also related to the different system of production and um, one thing that that_ there's some studies that have looked at organic coffee work for example. no study have been done to look at labor, uh and n- the uh the whole economics including labor of the shaded plantations. but it has been done for, for organic plantations, many of which are shaded plantations. and they tend to consume higher labor than uh, the non-organic a- and and in the case of organics it's primarily because of the whole, uh the compost and they have to put the compo- compost in the plants an- and all that. so it requires a lot of labor. in the coffee plantations that are highly diverse, you also save some labor in terms of weeding, in terms of fertilizing and things like that, because it's a it's a really integra- integrated system. a lot of the- the the canopy of the trees is controlling the weeds. and also a lot of the uh, the leaf litter that falls add nutrients to the system and they they don't, and so especially in weed control, it's a big saving, uh labor-saving uh method, to have that that canopy of trees... anyone? uh y- you this very interesting uh talk about the the agreement of everyone except the agronomists, uh you know focuses attention on something we're all interested in, how do you build, interdisciplinary activities? ho- how can you organize things to draw that agronomist into, a team, that tries to work together to increase, not just yield, but uh a a balanced kind of production. got any ideas about that? no. the thing is, the s- schools are highly fragmented, like for example, John started this talk by by saying well we're not M-S-U, you know why do agriculture here. and, i think that the importance of doing agriculture here is that we have a very different perspective. you go to M-S-U and yes, there are people there that are doing sustainable agriculture there's a whole group of people but they are like this in comparison to the whole establishment of the land grant institution. and so an agronomist that get trained there, gets trained  i i think you know, that i- in a curious way, part of the problem might be just because of the the way the history of interdisciplinary research has gone in recent years, uh part of the part of the st- part of the, the the solution might be to stop using the word interdisciplinary. because for so many disci- disciplines, like agronomy yeah yeah yeah problem oriented   when you when you think of for example buildings, organizational structures that would promote this value, you have things like the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis, which does very good interdisciplinary work because you've got a lot of, disciplinary folks from different regions working on a problem. and people are thinking here now at University of Michigan, what kind of organizational structure should we have, that would deal with environmental issues broadly rather than with one specific discipline at a time? well, i think these kind of seminars, is you know, is part of it. because i am sure there are a lot of people here that are not from the ecological side of things and, so, i i think i- it does bring up a a lot of uh interdisciplinary things. uh uh i i guess my question about labor utilization was related to that because you know when you're talking about development models, which i think John is talking about when he talked about, sort of science-based green revolution technology versus a softer impact. um, the question of you know, are people going to be sustained, and and the sustainability of social structures relates to having a job so i think one very interesting component of your really fascinating work would be to know what the implications were for the sort of diversity of employment and sus- subsistence opportunities mhm yeah yeah George? do you guys have enough information yet to know what the what the relative comparison is between the decrease in diversity from a from a forest, uh to a shade plantation and the relative increase going from a shade plantation in terms of coffee yield, to the high-yielding full sun varieties. because for example if if you can think of the trade-off if you just look at yield, even if you just kept yield the same, in the diversity it it might work out that it's better to put more of the shaded plantations into full-sun varieties and take that land and put it into, just let it return to natural forest. so if you get a, if you get a greater yield, per unit area, a a little bit greater out of that, then you get a species increase, and and what you do with the all the people that depend on coffee     yes, uh i uh i would approach that with a multidimensional answer. i can- i agree with Ivette. that is one thing, uh the fact is you're dealing with facts on the ground here, people produce coffee. okay now if you wanna have an industrial program where are people gonna stop producing coffee, which did happen in Puerto Rico, okay that's one thing but that has to be one component of it. the second component of it uh is the the one that i think you were getting at, and the one that you were getting at was the was whether you can have this this trade-off with producing a lot of coffee over here, uh and still preserving the biodiversity by having all that forest and everything. uh it turns out that you don't reduce ant biodiversity hardly at all when you go, as just I- Ivette showed you here, uh- when you go from a forest to a shaded plantation, uh you just don't. but you do reduce butterfly diversity quite a lot. so it actually depends on what kind of biodiversity you're really interested in and it's not clear how that uh, how that actually would, how that actually would shake out it really isn't. but then there's a third component too, George. and that is this whole productionist mentality. we don't wanna produce more coffee in the first place. okay there's too much coffee in the world as it is. uh, the price of coffee isn't high enough for most coffee producers to actually make a living. uh what we're after, and what we should be after, is, reduction in the c- in in in the production of coffee. not more c- not more, not more coffee.  excellent   excellent  higher   why don't we have one more question and then we'll break as a group and anybody else can stay on and talk with John and Ivette, i'll let you choose. he- this gentleman here. well, i- it seems that you have exactly the same sort of problem as you do with, population that's growing in India. in India, one has a greater sense of security as a family by having the largest number of children. the whole belief for India it's a disaster. and coffee plantations, what is desirable globally is not optimal for a guy who owns his five hectares. he gets more coffee, he gets more money, gets more income, employs less labor, if he makes a modern, and uh, agricultural, uh plantation. without the biodiversity. so you essentially have to legislate this or impose it so that uh the individuals can accept this. because, for the individual owning the land, it's not his optimum path. we can we can  just one problem related to that and that's that's what the strategy uh that came out of the Smithsonian i, uh addresses. and essentially their main point is that you have to convince people, that they should pay more, for this product because the the yield is lower, so the farmer is not gonna want to have a lower yield and still receive the same price. but if you can assure this farmer a higher price for a lower yield, he's gonna break even or he's gonna be more or less the same. he's not gonna end up losing, by having it in the shade of his plantation or her plantation. so, that's that's one of the uh market oriented, market oriented uh strategies to the (xx) grower. that that that's that's one strategy, but i think you've made a good point there, before. the other strategy is a legislative strategy. in the places we've done it before, we've done it over and over again before. when, the public at large and especially the political leaders of the world acknowledge that there's an emergency situation. it happened in World War Two, it happened during the Cold War, and it happened at several other points also. if biodiversity loss is regarded by the world as an emergency situation which i think it should be. unfortunately it's not. there is an emergency situation there, we can get the world to legislate, the way coffee should be produced. and that's what i think needs to happen. i'm not nearly as, sanguine about the market approach that Ivette uh  i don't i don't i see a lot of problem with that approach. but that's an approach that actually has received a lot of attention, right now. so you need an OPEC of coffee producers,  yeah for coffee growers, COPEC   well, along with the W-T-O. along with the W-T-O. well on that note, have another cup of coffee on your way out and let's thank John and Ivette for a really nice (xx) thanks, that was very interesting session. you're welcome.

LES495JU063.json	um, the first question is, you know what is your goal of your project, how did you communicate this towards me as clearly as possible? uh second, how did you make sure that i would go along with this project and especially the class would go along, um you know what, you know what techniques did you use, to make sure that that you know we would comply with your project? and second uh, and of course this goes, goes already into the uh, um what i was gonna say, um you know what was our willingness? what were our incentives to, to comply with you? um so i mean these are some of the techniques we're gonna discuss today, in um, in the context of four concepts, one is communication, again communication of specific goals, and purposes. and, also communication of what would happen if we, did not, comply. you know what capabilities, did you have at your disposal, uh to influence us what was your credibility in making sure that we believe, um, your sincerity, and ultimately you know again, why were we willing to uh comply, in the end i mean that means, class and me. so you know we can actually fit this, i- i- in right neatly, um with the discussion of today. and, in foreign policy at least, um, probably little less interpersonal interactions cuz our class is, in world politics and international relations. usually, sovereign states individual states, you know we noted resort to, to three forms of influence, techniques. and they may do so in sequence, they may use those um individually or in some combination. so one of them of course we reviewed or discussed in greater detail yesterday, is the use of threats of force, or threats of punishment. that is, you communicate quite clearly, hopefully as cl- as clearly as possible, a goal what you want, a target. if you are the actor, what you want the target to achieve, um what you want the target not to do, um what behavior in the target do you actually seek? uh so you need to specify this cl- as clearly as possible. second, um what is gonna happen if the target fails to comply with your wishes? then you know as far as threats go, you need to make sure that it's very clear on what the punishment ultimately is gonna gonna gonna be, um, you know if the target fails to carry out, um, the demand. or comply with the demand. and um, here of course we we noted, that two items are quite critical. first of all, if you are called upon, to carry out your threat, actually to translate that into punishment, into inflicting pain and harm, then what is the size of your capabilities i request the size of, meaning, can you actually, physically, inflict harm? and can you locate the target? can you locate the target can you reach the target and then, ultimately use whatever, um, economic or, or military weapons you have at your disposal to um, to actually punish, the target. then also, you know what is the credibility, your willingness actually to carry out the threat? even if you have large capabilities say military forces at your disposal, uh, that does not guarantee that the, target believes that you're gonna use 'em. and you know how do you convince the target, that punishment ulti- ultimately is gonna come through, and that the threat is actually is carried out. you know how willing are you to use what you have? and f- l- ultimately of course is, you know what, what are the chances given all this, given the threat given the capabilities, that you need to carry out your threat? the credibility the willingness ris- with which with which you're going to do this, and ultimately, you know how does this really affect the probability that a target is gonna do what you expect it to do. and, we discussed most of the um the first three items, um, in quite some detail yesterday communication c- c- capability and credibility. um, always note when it comes to threats, as far y- as far as your goals and your punishment goals. you want make sure that, i mean if you're the actor and if you pose a threat, of doing something if a target does not comply with you, you know make sure that the demands are quite moderate. i mean you don't want to change, you know to really turn the, a target upside-down. i mean you make moderate demands but at the same time if the target fails to comply with those moderate demands, then, the punishment that is likely to follow is gonna be quite severe. so, if you use a threat, to get the target to do what you want it to do, you want to make, to to to, demand the behavior change, to be as moderate or as low as possible, um, so the target, you know does not see too much of an inf- infringement on its freedom of action, and of its own way of life, and ultimately, you know but if the target does not comply then you you say well then you, you have to fear really ultimate destruction. and, the way th- threats are usually used, i mean they're usually used in a conflictual environment when it's very unlikely that more positive inducements incentives for behavior change are likely to to take place or, that they're gonna be successful. so the environment's quite conflictual, and of course we uh, we mentioned that the, um the threats, the benefits from actually posing the threat and having to carry it out, need to exceed the costs for you as the actor to actually carry out the threat. i lo- i like to just, i like to u- for us to focus on the willingness to comply. um, because you know we only touched upon this during the last, two minutes or three minutes in class yesterday. and so today, we're gonna finish the section on threats. um, talk about what effect ultimately, the likelihood that a target is gonna do what an actor wants. so we're gonna finish this up today, and then we're gonna move, into bribes rewards and promises. positive incentives, that you give a target in order to make sure that it responds as you wish it to respond. and then from uh, more material uh tangen- um or um, um you know direct, um bribes, um and and and rewards we're gonna move into more like manipulation of the mind. of thinking. uh, persuasion. and persuasion usually takes pl- takes two forms. propaganda, is usually directed at masses, at publics, and uh, theory social some broad social economic political theory that's usually up at the leadership or the elites of states, okay? so this is where we gonna, where we, um where we hope to end up, by the end of this class today. willingness to comply. um, here, th- the likelihood that a target is willing to to comply with an actor's demands, very often also hinges upon, how much damage, the target is willing to suffer. so, the willingness to suffer, when we talk about, the willingness to comply... how much harm did you say two level games? two level games two level diplomacy. oh when, when they um, people who are organizing foreign policy they have to, kinda work on two levels, one with the the other country and one like within, with the force within their, their own country. absolutely. that's exactly the point, so, negotiators and it mostly relates to diplomatic and trade relations but may be also true for um, security issues. two level games does the other negotiator have the same thing going on? uh oh absolutely i mean they they they're all, it's it's, any negotiator all negotiators from all countries bring in it's like a mirror yeah it's i mean what, i mean this is only this is only one negotiator from one state but you're absolutely right. from all other states, you can imagine, um, maybe you could uh, mm, envision it i'm trying to, get this, i mean clear as graphic, graphically clear as possible. um, you okay this is your table here. can everybody see this here or... okay, here's your your table, let- oh let's take for example the um, what is it now, the Group of Eight. Group of Eight is meeting, um they're usually it's it's it's an annual meeting by the leader, by the leaders of um the eight most industrialized and powerful countries. these days United States, um, United Kingdom France Italy, four, Canada Japan is six France seven and Russia nowadays too, is eight. so, we can imagine they're all sitting around the table the dilemma here is however, that, very often, you know certainly not in in in the in in in Germany of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties, but very often uh in wha- in in many other situations, think about it. a public is more likely to be politically active and attentive if it is, usually fairly well educated has access to a lot of information diverse information, so in other words, the politically attentive and active public, selects itself mostly out of those people who are are, educated who perceive stakes who are aware of the stakes, and who have access to information. but, if you try to capture that public which you need to capture if propaganda is to succeed to influence leaders through the public, the problem there is then, the more educated the better educated usually people are, and the more, aware they are, of of the variety of information, and especially information that contradicts, kind of the the the snake oil kind of propaganda, um, the more likely they are to realize that that propaganda is is is based, totally on distorted information is wrong. that is, the more educated they become, generally, i mean of course there're exceptions and Germany in the nineteen twenties is an exception, um, usually the more educated people become, the more aware they are, based on their information that that propaganda is wrong, the more of course that propaganda becomes, removed from their sense of reality. so in other words there's a contradiction on the one hand you want to capture those who are educated and who can make a difference but those are exactly the people who are likely to be aware, of of of the of the distortion by the pro- you know of of you know that's involved in propaganda. um, where this, conflict actually mattered um, was you know a good example here, is, in the early nineteen eighties, the... the uh the uh the West Europeans, even even in the late nineteen seventies early nineteen eighties, the West Europeans asked the, requested the United States to deploy, uh Pershing Two, and Cruise Missiles in Europe as a counterweight, to previously deployed Soviet, um S-S twenty missiles and you don't have to remember the name of the missiles here, um point here was, that the Soviet Union had previously installed, missiles that were able to target, cities in West- only cities in Western Europe not in the U-S, had deployed those missiles on the territory of the West Soviet Union and Eastern Europe so the the Soviet Union had deployed, uh nuclear missiles, capable of reaching any target within Western Europe but not of the U-S. the idea was of course to decouple, Western Europe, from the U-S. and, basically where the Soviet Union ultimately could say, well we're only interested in targeting West Europe but not the U-S so, United States stay out. of course the the Western Europeans were not very l- at least the leaderships were not very happy with this. so they then asked for a counterweight, they said well, you know if the Soviet Union hits our cities you know we wanna make sure we you know definitely, s- have a second strike capability, we talked about second strike capability yesterday, meaning you are able to retaliate after an attack, and so they asked for modernization for missiles from the U-S to be uh deployed in Western Europe. well the Soviet Union of course was not very happy with this, so what did the Soviets do? they launched a massive propaganda campaign to influe- in if possible the attentive, educated publics at Universities mostly, in Western Europe um, to get, that, attentive public to reject and put pressure on on Western European leaderships, not actually to decide, in their parliaments, to accept missiles from the U-S, uh accept missiles from the U-S. i mean the countries that were most affected by those missiles that were supposed to be deployed in Western Europe, um, England, there were four countries England Netherlands Germany and Italy. um so those four countries, um you had you found a tremendous campaign, propaganda campaign by the Soviet Union to prevent those publics, and make them make sure that those public influenced their leaders, not to accept, those counter-missiles. well, how- you know, how successful were the Soviets? well in the end the Soviets were not very successful um, of course there were some peace, the the Peace Movement was was quite active, um, the Greens environmentalist were quite active but ultimately they did not succeed. um, all governments in all four countries actually welcomed, those missiles. why? well, the reason why, the So- well the Soviet idea was, well it's only the American missiles to Soviet Union, the Mo- the M- the leaders in Moscow said that uh that are the dan- uh dan- dangerous for the peace. they said the American missiles raised the threat of war in Europe. i mean that's that's what and raised the threat of nuclear Armageddon in Europe. and that was the fear, and you know there was a slogan in in Western Europe kind of you know which said better better Red than dead. you know better live under communism than you know being evaporated. um that was kind of the propaganda but it was not, it was not believed why? because the reality was as follows, it was the Soviets who had taken the first step and actually deployed missiles, being able to target, cities in Western Europe. but the American or the West European combined with with American counter that was a counter move. the decision to in- install, American missiles was a counter-move. so it was the Soviets actually who had, taken the first step and and deployed missiles which would, ultimately threaten the peace. second, the American deployment of missiles, was put in a context of negotiations, that were supposed to eliminate all, medium and intermediate range meeting missiles see it you know, E- Europe specific missiles, out of Europe entirely. so the the Americans wanted, and also Europ- the West Europeans wanted to get rid of you know all, Soviet and American missiles. well the Soviet Union, didn't agree. so i mean the Soviet Union was, you know the propaganda was pretty hollow, for two reasons. for one thing the Soviet Union, was the one that had, started this whole process by installing its own missiles, and second the Soviet Union was the side that failed to agree or that that that that resisted, taking all intermediate range missiles out of Europe. so, the reality was, ultimately it was the Soviet Union that was perceived as a greater threat and hence the propaganda by the Soviets to say, Soviet Union is peaceful U-S is is is or the West and the United States are are warmongers and that propaganda of course, failed. you know because i mean, people weren't were fairly educated, uh to realize ultimately i mean the majority, were ultimately fairly educated that they did not vote um uh against that decision and ultimately what happened, um i- it turned out to be a smart move the the initial deployment of Pershing Two and cruise missiles i mean ultimately lead to the dismantling of all, as the Americans had or- originally s- uh uh s- sought, ultimately lead to the dismantlement, of all intermediate, range missiles, in Europe. um, so you know, propaganda here not very successful. so, notice the the bottom line on propa- of propaganda is there needs to be a moment of crisis, where uh where where some leadership, resorts to scapegoating, uh through the through some, pseudo relevant, solution. um, distorted information, mostly scapegoating against a group within the country or against another state. and the the the the problem there, the difficulty with propaganda is on the one hand you need the attentive public to influence the leadership, but the more attentive the more informed the public is, in uh in a lot of cases the more likely it is to realize that you know the propaganda is just hot hot air balloon. mkay? any questions still on propaganda? finally, uh, political and economic theory, and, mm also persuasion. well, see persuasion both in propaganda and political and economic theory, what it means it tries to, to influence, the psyche or the mind of people. so it does not get at the pocketbook it does not get at physical security, it gets at people's minds and thinking. that's what it's supposed to achieve. that's why we call it persuasion. um get people in you know get people or get at least states to do something, through persuasion either of the public or the leadership. political and economic theory is mostly target at the at the country's leadership, directly. so it appeals to leaders or elites, it emphasizes the common interest between the leaders, of the target state at the leaders of the actor, state. it emphasize some common gain so, you communicate to the target side, if you agree, to play along, with us then you know we all are gonna be better off. and you try to convey legitimacy. that is, the it's it's the the economic political order you're trying to establish, is supposed to be supported, not only by your own country but by others as well. um, you know, the probably the best example here, in political and economic theory, is um is really the the whole, international trading and political system, mostly economic system that was set up, mostly by, through sponsorship by the United States following World War Two. um, the notion of self-determination after World War One as promised by um, Woodrow Wilson is clearly a political larger, you know universal, universally aspired um, um economic and political theory people should have the right, for so- to self-rule. um, you know global spread of free trade and legal democracy. (lost) but it's very ideological, um political driven, economic free trade is important. so as World War Two came to a close, um first of_ we had two, events here. even throughout World War Two, on the one hand, we have, what's what's referred to as the nineteen forty-one, Atlantic Charter. (xx) oh i'm sorry uh which one? yeah uh just basically the first (xx) on the propaganda or? on European political order yeah i'm gonna repeat this again. um hm? okay mhm   see you Tuesday oh wow happy birthday oh thank you. there's an extra one oh okay thank you. 	1

Anne, so okay, i i can't even well, pardon me bottom?  replicate would that be better? replicate is, replicate a culture, no. better expression, Ken? um, they might emulate it. i mean they're looking at the ge- the geography of te- of Ptolemy and Pliny the Elder at this point and going_ they they ex- they explained it in the past, they were right because they ruled an entire empire. so your suggestion is that, is that, we might say, that they, um... they looked, to the past, and they emulated, the example, of the past. now, let's just  i was confused as to whether like just, the sake of tradition, was accessing the past or are you looking for like examples like, like i have in there like, Clovis, like how how Gregory of, of Tours says you know he em- he imitates, how, um Constantine comp- is that more what you're looking  so it's al- it's always been that way, like as far as they know. so what you can say is, that would make that would make your point more forceful is that these stories, celebrate... ha- the heroes, and traditions of the past. and the stories are intended to model, present and future behavior, on past heroism. mkay mhm  okay like innovation versus tradition or  okay.  okay later? wasn't Clovis in five hundred? Clovis Clovis is maybe four-ninety-six. but the point is, you've just you've done Beowulf, and Roland,  so i should list them chronologically,  and that would be before Beowulf? and that would be before Beowulf. okay. well he wants to make Clovis more like he's not really Christian but, he wants to make him more Christian-like by emanating, that's, a good point. establish validity is_ you go to, the s- the the state fairgrounds and you get cotton candy. and you know, what is cotton candy? it's sort of air and sugar, and finally you hit the cardboard. you know i don't mean to pick on you, no    legitimac- legitimacy. validity and legitimacy are two different things. now lemme tell you what's really going on here. what's really going on here, is... um, i can teach grammar, i can teach spelling, i can teach punctuation, i can teach even a certain amount of history. but there's one thing that takes time to learn, and that i can't teach in one term. mhm mhm yeah that was what i was looking to say i just couldn't verbalize it that way yeah. this is, right, and this is this is what_ the only way to do that is is to read good stuff. um, you know. now i'll tell you in your defense. um, the biggest bookstore in Cambridge Massachusetts is the Harvard Coop. they have something like, i dunno, a huge inventory, something like a hundred and eighty thousand books. the problem is that a hundred and twenty thousand of them are by Steven King, and the other sixty thousand are by John Grisham. um, so something is happening in Cambridge, maybe that M-I-T is gonna be the last bastion of the English language. and you know John Grisham and and Steven King, are great writers. but their vocabulary is severely restricted. um, okay... now, the next example, and this is also, out of place, is Charlemagne the real Charlemagne. that should go before Roland. but after, Beowulf. Beowulf... Augustine? no,  um not five twenty-nine but four ninety-two, Gelasius the First, looks back to the Bible, with the gospels of two swords i hadn't thought of that. um, so, one example would be, Pope Gelasius, who who justifies the power of the papacy, on the basis of, a, a biblical text. now you could actually argue that this is, depending on how you feel about it, that this is a misuse of the text. Benedict. was Benedict and why? he borrows from Roman kind of civilization the abbot (a la) father in the way he constructs his rule. um, is, is the is the abbot of a monastery is no more, and no less, than, uh, ju- kind of the model, Roman, father. of of a Roman family. i, talked about that in, in in lecture so, not all the_ uh the reason i, you know i, i i mention these, just to point out that not all of your examples need be, political, examples. yes? they had had great contact with Roman civilization the people who were, basically like, speaking, or writing Beowulf and possibly the monastery i can understand that but, would there be a lot of, kind of looking back at the past in that work  mhm the giants, or  mhm, that's what i thought so could i- so then would church be lower case or upper case or like how, oh,  okay uhuh (hit-) add two more add add two more i didn't make a count but and then like expound on what i had like and then go  mhm mhm so it's okay to have that many, examples? yeah, yeah you you have to worry a little bit about the time constraint, which is why knowing just what to write, knowing_ that's why diction_ i mean the ex- exam's Thursday i can't help you with, with diction how long will we have what, what are the time divisions we have or is it just up to us to do the essay,  okay. then like  okay someone else can go, that's alright. okay. alright, um it does i mean it are these comments sensible are they helpful? yes very much. um, could we, could you shape an argument, on this, by saying that you by disagreeing because, the memory of the past is fuzzy? you can, you yes you can do that. um, and you can sa- and then then you would give some examples of, of of that how for instance... how anybody, could look at Clovis, and say this is a Constantine, requires one to, uh, i mean Ken's a Roman historian so he understands, he has a a larger, context in which to think of this. that this man who's, who's the who's, fundamentally an illiterate killer, um, um, so it's it's a, you can say that, you could make the argument, they say they're doing this, but they sure aren't. and that's why i, that's why i put that e- put that example in. i mean, yeah Galileo uses Augustine. but Augustine never, observed nature and made the observation of nature. Augustine never did, experiments. so yes you could, you could, you could turn it on, turn it on its head very easily. would you have other examples that you'd had in mind, about  mhm uhuh   God walked the earth. God walked the earth. pilgrimage. uh and so it's it's a question of, we're trying to look back to the past but it's a past that, they've constructed with their present made it up uh but with Saint Francis and Pepin couldn't you both say, couldn't you say for both that, although they may have_ the- there was still an element of looking to the past cuz Saint Francis, t- had the element of looking back to Christ for an example, while sort of rejecting current authority. and, um, Pepin ha- was anointed, just like you know the Roman emperors in, in ways looking back that you can, you can make the case though on one level, i mean you can make the, the nebbish case which is a little bit of this and a little bit of that which is a perfectly acceptable case. Pepin is saying, the tradition of the Merovingians, screw it. nuts to it. no more. i'm gonna do something new, except that part of it is very old. what is new is i'm getting papal sanction, what is old is i'm doing, uh what happened to David, i'm going to be anointed... so so you could do that. and there are, uh, Francises on the one hand, uh, very much looking to the past but what, what Francis ends up doing, is is throwing down the gauntlet to the entire system including, including the historical church. when Francis said says take your money throw it away, and, and, and, and, do what Jesus did, that is, a threat to every, cathedral... in Europe and i showed you slides of those cathedrals and you know how much money was tied up in those cathedrals. yeah. was Francis, was Francis a layma- like a layman he wasn't ordained as  but but he they did at one time, were able to hear confessions but that's not the same thing as being a priest like, i don't_ Francis doesn't hear confessions.  it it says in the text that a wi- i guess maybe that later on, the the monas- the Franciscans were able to hear confession, is,   wouldn't that also be a case of like, the church twisting Francis's image basically to fit into their institution like with Saint Bonaventure's, um biography  oh oh i oh i was just i think earlier i was just gonna ask if, um to go along with this first essay if th- oh oh i no i actua- well the Refor- the Reformation is, you know one example with Luther looking back to the past and the early church and what not, that is not just sort of missing from that essay but um, mhm  yeah what is virtue? well let's see what Plato had to say. and and to find out let's go, get manuscripts of Plato. yes of course. would you not be drawing the line at all between custom, and perhaps like, the actual pa- i mean well like you've been saying, but like with Gregory the Seventh, for example he wanted to go back to, uhuh i don't   donation of Constantine mm i think there's something better yes. is it Charlemagne and Roland?   serfs  (xx) can we also use the example from uh Roland about how Charlemagne was confused in this um, period of transition from using custom into, um, getting, a, a number of vassals to decide what's the right thing to do? you could, you could do that. you could do that, then you would be, then you would be dealing in part with_ that that's a counterexample, to this quotation. and you could build up, you could build up the, the, uh, the the set of counterexamples, as we as i've given you some. but that would certainly serve_ the whole question of the trial of Gamelon could be, you could say you know this demonstrates that in the year ten ninety, you have, people who're puzzled, about whether, past experience, should be the guide, because past experience, isn't working out. you could put Beowulf, stand Beowulf on his head and say, they say they're looking to the past, and all the stories are about the past, but all the stories, you end up with failure. they look to the past and say kinship is crucial, and Beowulf has no sons, etcetera etcetera etcetera so you could, you could make, you could use, uh Beowulf to, to, to argue that case. the, the real answer is of course it's a mixture of of this, and Ken's point. cuz that's the way it really was. but at a hundred level course i'm not gonna, to to make that, crucial. you had your hand up, partly. yeah i was just gonna say that is there not also could you not also point to like Roland and O- versus Ol- and Oliver  something developing the i'm sorry could i ask one last thing about that one? yeah sure go you can certainly, you could certainly make that argument okay Galileo would fit into that right? how? well like the the way we were talking about he, he wanted to save the church and he thought he was working within the Bible but it ended up to be, like,  mhm he wasn't    okay um, can we do part three, please? yeah i don't have a lot to offer on part three since, wi- with rare exceptions it's uh, um, it's all out of the text book. well a ship, (Portuguese then it should be) fourteen eighty? okay just a just a minute. what is it? boat it's a cargo boat cargo boat it's a large cargo vessel, but what distinguishes it from, the cargo vessel that you see plying, the Saint Lawrence seaway? it's based on Viking ships?    fourteen eighty? fourteen eighty. historical significance? conquest? pardon me? well, could you give that to me in a sentence? uh, used to help conquest their y- armies and stuff okay i'm not hearing you,  okay, now, um, there's there's a subject, to that verb that i'm having difficulty with. who conquering whom? that's one thing it_ was it a Portuguese invention i'm curious? alright it's_ carrack. large, cargo vessel, well armed, Portuguese, invented, fourteen eighty... the vessel of European overseas conquest. did, Columbus use it, on his conquest should we mention that or uh, only if you have time he had he had i think uh two caravels... i may have said in class that he had a carrack but i'm not so certain now i need to, to check out whether the Santa Maria was a, was was a carrack but that's, that's all you need for that i mean, the danger there, is going on and on and on. yes? i had a question um, the mathematical principles, were not in the text book, um, and i was wondering and i couldn't find them in my lecture notes i don't know okay alright. who was the author? um... was it uh was it Galileo?  who was the author please? Newton? alright. so, uh, the book, by Sir Isaac Newton, date, could look it up. um, i've got it someplace, um sixteen eighty-seven (capitalist?) significance significance significance. significance? couldn't find it either i didn't know what it was talking about which one it was talking about. um, um, i no i want somebody who hasn't spoken. significance? um that, it was a new way of looking at, uh, (an experience) a new way of looking at? everything around you?  it was not a new way of looking at tables. oh of, calcu- what distinguishes nat sci courses from h- humanities courses? yeah you know the answer you're smiling so come on help us out. help us out. basically if we're, calculating it um, observation... better  the subject the numbers what? uh it is the mathematical, (creed) and it is, uh it is it is, let's actually see what Perry has to say about this. cal- like calculating the laws of nature, no? calculating the laws of nature is not correct. you don't calculate the laws of nature. you can express. yeah, express them isn't it also the first explicit work about the Law of Gravity? that depends on whether you think Galileo understood, what ga- what gravity was about. i mean New- um, the first work about the Law of Gravity. um, i- that depends on on, that depends on on whether you think Galileo had a sense of what gravity was, and that's a matter of dispute among scholars, but it's perfectly okay. the formulation i just gave you was a little more general but that's, but that's fine. but it was written by Newton, right? yes it was written by Newton. so, what does,  okay uhuh i see. is,  uh, that's the first, that's the first thoroughgoing proof. um, before we leave this question could you please, um, tell us what uh the importance, of Roger Bacon is? you tell me. i i'm sorry what you're asking me to do, is, that which i said that i would not do. well i have the answers but i wanted to know if i'm right or wrong. ah, okay. that's not what you asked me a minute ago. well you um, well, he's a English Franciscan monk and philosopher, and um, his interest in science foreshadowed the modern attitude toward science, and his most important works are the experime- experiments in optics observations in sp- the speed of light and descriptions of, um, anatomy. now do you believe that you're gonna have the time to write all that down...? i don't know.  um, not all of that is at is of equal importance. okay. yeah i have that. yes i don't have one written but we outlined, um, question two, which is um, this is, essay question two? on part one? well, um, what happens in the idea of authority? well i mean i guess our basic idea is that, we said that, um it starts in Beowulf there's like the blood feud equals legal authority, sort of, um so it's like this society of  okay mhm like brute strength, whomever, whatever war- most skilled warrior, most influence? um because you can win like your k- a kingship or because Beowulf was, successful he did take over the king. does authority rest, in a book? it's individual's brute strength. uh, and, typically who would be, the strongest individual? king so, i think a, the leader of, the war band... you see, you were, you're quite correct in everything you said. mhm um, does, could the blood feud be brought in here at all? because it's sort of a, it's sort of the legal system in a way. um, you if you wanna talk about law, mhm okay. um i guess  i'm sorry okay um i also wrote a essay on that but, i didn't start with Beowulf i started with um, actually Augustus, Octinian who was, could you, back up that far or would it just be, (too low) you can use, you can use the Roman empire as a as as a starting point. okay. that's, okay. um, well, wasn't he granted, um, emperor by the council? but i wasn't sure, where the council  okay. military strength? um, i see that almost as part in terms of imperial will because the emperor supposedly_ but but suppor- support of the republic? no that's going back too far. i- it's it's the one thing for instance, if this were, if this were a European class, instantly would, would get would would get the answer. was the question is is there's another, really significant source of authority. tax coinage? lineage, who your father was? 'm'm   people here who are not going who are not pre meds are what? L-S and A. according to your parents. if you're not a pre med what are you? law student law. so Roman law? Roman law. Roman law is is, i- it permeates, European law just get tossed in the jug on the continent and and you'll find that, it is unbelievably different from what we have here, and that is because, uh European legal systems are fundamentally founded upon principles of Roman law which work very differently from our own. very differently. um, so with the um the question of the war like the king is th_ if he's the most powerful then he's, the king   cuz if you had, money wealth power i think you could make it, somewhat broader than that. i think you could say, that after fourteen, twenty-five or something like that, that that... um um i guess i think, next, we talked about, um, uh i i guess sort of the m- i don- i don't know if this would be any different than Beowulf necessarily but with the Merovingians and the Carolingians and sort of, well i guess there's a difference between the two but well, what gives, um... for the, for, this society and for the Merovingians, mhm strength isn't it also mysticism though in a way? well, not mysticism. again i'm getting here to this this matter of diction. um, uh, because, because none of them were mystics. i mean they write, they, they just weren't mystics. um, but, what i think you're suggesting is that... what made, um, what gave some of the authority to the Merovingians was not only the fact that, that, their leaders, at least of origins were powerful, but these folkloric aspects. such as the long blond hair. um things like that. and then and then, um, i mean for instance you could you could, you could build an essay let's see. let's say you don't wanna spend half the essay on law. let's say, i'm going to spend half this essay talking about political authority. therefore i'm going to talk about what makes somebody a king. what makes somebody a king, in Augustus' time, is, possession of an office, and, the, protection of the law. what makes somebody a king, in Beowulf's time, is military prowess, generosity, heroism. what makes someone a king in the time of Pepin, is, um yeah approval of the troops, military power, but also you need to have, papal sanction, anointment. what makes somebody uh, uh, a, uh, good king, uh in the time of, oh i don't know, Philip Augustus, eleven eighty to twelve, twenty, uh is, um you need now a bureaucracy, you no longer need to be very_ you no longer have to have physical strength cuz you no longer need to lead the armies, uh you need to have full control of, feudal, law, feudal custom, at your disposal, you need to have lots of vassals, things like that. what do you need to be a good king, in the year fifteen hundred? guns. guns, uh a good uh internal revenue service, you know, you could look at it, you could look at it that way. but certainly that would only be half of it the other half would be, to look at some other aspect of it which is, um, intellectual authority. i've given a couple of examples of, of, of that. yes? um the way i constructed this essay i just wanna see, if this is wro- uh true, if this is an acceptable way or not is that i define authority in either being with the king, with religion or with science, and then i said the first tension that uh uh time we covered in class, was between the king, and religion, and then i gave examples. and then the second tension give me an example. between kings and religion? yeah okay, w- it's not kings and religion kings and the church the church yeah and then the second tension, which came later on was between religion and science, for example Galileo. yeah that's a way of doing it mkay what about like a change to from like the divine right of kings,  that's the same thing. same thing and notice that, you might say, there's a notion that power, f- i mean for a thousand years power descended. it descended to kings, it descended to, to popes or to priests as well. and in the eleventh century there was a big dispute about, who got more of it. and part of the end of that dispute was a notion that the subjects, have the right, to rebel, and to po- a- rebel against and to de- depose, a, a uh, uh, an unjust, ruler. and that, gets the camel's nose inside the tent. and then later you can talk about how that is, you you have a, beginnings of notions of government which are ascending, rather than descending. papacy never accepts that but it certainly is something which is a, part of the Reformation. what is an example of, the people deposing, a ruler that early? oh, there is no example of people, well there is no example of people deposing a ruler that early, but what you do have is already in the eleventh century at the time of the investiture contest, there's a lot of literature that says this is justified. just the uprisings on the manor? is that no that when you have an, uh when you have an unjust monarch, that it is legitimate to, to depose him. uh, the first example, in which there is a monarch whose will is, is curtailed... we have that, we have that from the year twelve fifteen. and what is the document that's associated with that? Magna Carta? Magna Carta. Magna Carta is, i mean if you read Magna Carta, and in the long course we do read Magna Carta, if you read Magna Carta, there is nothing in it, that looks anything like, that that will lead to, to, to modern constitutional government. but in fact there're bits and pieces of it which are just ex- they're time bombs. very explosive. um, then we went to um, Pepin and Charlemagne just,   like a decentralized power? well there, there's a pyramid mhm i um, we did um, sort of a, brief outline but then we went on to, in terms of Louis and Charlemagne, um, where the king has, the king is more like of a actual, power figure himself, um, and that this is, although it's in a time of of deep feudalism that it's sort of this rise of individualism with king Louis saying, alright w- tell me what you think, and then he says mm, never mind, i'm gonna do it my way. that's good. okay. um, and then but at the same time there's a constant struggle between the church and the state with Louis, with the whole example with the friar yeah but that's, that's not, a struggle between church and state but within mhm okay that was part of one of our one, that we had thought about before um, yeah yeah  one thing to, to, to think about is, i- with that particular essay is, um and then we went on to we, i mean discussed the thirteenth century, conflict between Innocent the Third and the German monarchy, as being just this, just sort of this (water shedding down,) the institution of religion  right. um, and then, the fo- how fourteenth century and sort of like post-Black Death is, leads to the end of feudalism with the rise of the middle class and, sort of, a more free those things happened but i would not necessarily say that those are, that there was the one cause which would be the Black Death, um i didn't sa- i just said it was sort of post-Black Death okay, um... think here for just a second... just the destruction of feudalism, of feudalism uh, the decay, i think of feudalism. you know, if you wanted to you could certainly, in in this, um, might not work so well here, well it might, but you might, s- you might want to ask yourself, notions of authority. do those... what does a Black Death do to those? and you can point out that since it was so unexpected i- that did like questioning the authorities and the, uh i- help the rise of universities and, new religious ideas and all that kind of stuff well the universities are older, right i guess we went kind of on to the Reformation, and, i- i- i- it questions religious authority and sort of, the Pope's actual authority over people's ideas and, sort of spirituality yeah for Luther what is the, what is the source of authority? the Bible and the personal, reading  um, and then, with, the, science, Lutheran science gives power to the intellectuals and, sort of merchants and, over time the church almost becomes secondary. what, what science and technology do is they make it possible for anybody, remember i used the_ i i referred to tinkers and i meant that. i meant that people have the leisure time to thi- sit around and play with uh, you know i dunno... their Fisher Price toys or whatever and and uh, see what you can do with them... i have not in this class talked much about the commercial revolution i just haven't had time. in in a in a longer course we would've had some dis_ more to say about the rise of cities and about the rise of commerce but, just haven't had time in the six weeks. uh can we do question number four from part two? are we are we done with, are we done with question two in part one? with the Scientific Revolution, um, in in terms of authority are, sh- are we saying that... authority is now with those people who can, tinker, and who can invent, and can (observe it or) i i don't know if you wanna distinguish it in terms of classes of people but you can say that, that certainly a new source of authority, lies, in, um, observation, experimentation, those who have the power to derive general laws, that is people who can perform mathematical manipulation, so it could be tinkerers, it could be people sitting, um, like like Newton under an apple tree yeah, and as at_ by the time of like Newton has the church a- actually become secondary? because like Newton's not burned at the stake  okay. mhm mhm Tom Monaghan's, Catholic school, is that what you're talking about? i can't hear you. and and what what is it? it's like a, a Catholic law school, i think it is a law school and, and it is, it would be, the, uh_ and the and the curriculum, is gonna be formed, uh, along the lines of the great tradition of, of the Catholic teachings and the Catholic law schools. he seems to be not very happy with uh, what i think Fordham has a, nice law school. is there a law school at Notre Dame? must be. yes  in terms though would we need more examples than sort of what i gave you? well i didn't, i didn't do a, right right i'm having some problems, shaping, the fourth large essay, in my mind, um, that reproduce their discussion on this message. oh, yeah. there are traditionally, um, two ways of approaching that question. the first is... each one talks... and, explains, the views, that he has... a second approach is, um, that you think okay what are the possible, ways in which one or the other of them might say this is what Caesar means to me. and then have them go back and forth about that. and and i i'm not looking for something witty (xx) i have a s- ideas about women who um ran salons and by the way how does that, what does what does that do to women's position? it keeps them, in a subordinate role by like casting suspicion on women who, are supposed to have power maybe power over, men or,  um, then i talked about, salons and how they became educated and enlightened by, having all these discussions with men later on alright that's, uh good  don't go that far? don't go that far don't go that far this course this course comes to an end uh, this course comes to an end when it does for two reasons number one limits the time and number two when i get bored with history. okay  well i think i think you can, you could potentially talk about salons, okay you mean a person?  the Grand Duchess of Tuscany? yes, the Grand Duchess of Tuscany okay so you can use that... okay those are, those are, tho- tho- those are good examples. mhm, mhm. um, i guess you could say that, position doesn't_ you could also take the, stance that it doesn't change that much i mean they're still not getting, the same education, um as men they're having limited, opportunities  name me the great women philosophers of the Renaissance? thank you. okay nothing comes to mind (at the minute) okay, how about you. uh... i guess... um... you can talk about, after uh, feudalism, like when things started to become a democracy, and uh, women had uh, more roles in society. example? not sure. okay, i don't think you can use the word democracy in History one-ten. either in terms of the history or in terms of the way i run the class. um, i mean it's, you you can, it's a little early. it's it's it's a little early for (it yet.) okay i,    um i was gonna talk about, how feudalism, obviously, um, lessened the role of women in society because, vassals had, mainly paid their lords back through military, warfare and women, it was impossible for them to be a part of it and then i think once, feudal custom, was demolished or whatever and the scientific, revolution came around and it based more emphasis on, individuals mhm yes, yes yes. um, notice by the way that, revolution in military technology does not, make life easier for women either. um women in the guilds. like   yes, yes so that a woman can actually earn an independent income. something which, you know is, is not entirely accepted in parts of the United States of America. do these tapes get edited? they can. um, what is the circulation of these tapes? none. go ahead. oh i was gonna say uh, Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc, and Joan of Arc is interesting because she is, (i'm not) well yeah i was gonna say sh_ i mean, every, what she accomplished can't be (denied) but at the same time, in the end the way, the way she was treated and found as a heretic and   right  wasn't, i_ they, were looking for something to catch her on i think, what they finally got her on they told her she couldn't wear, men's clothes and as long as she didn't go  right.  is it Pakistan? no... Turkey. Turkey by far, by far. um, okay. uh, anything else on that particular question? that was, a question which woulda been, um, harder on the hour exam but now you can see there are, there are cases. uh, remember, who was it, what, one of you mentioned to me something about, what was it? how, yes, it's Galileo, where the church, is_ and the female, gender mhm yeah   i was gonna ask is the passage you were talking about the one where, he says something about um, men being taught by women and how that, makes them inferior? is that is that it? uh, um, i don't know.  yeah, i  i have a question concerning this quote from Galileo yeah. well, i don't know, you know what she would have made of it and as far as i know about, the documentary record, of it which i don't know well, um, that, that wasn't so much the argument because he was using the quotation, from an earlier source. the fact that, what the salon really was, was i mean she was an intelligent woman she would ask questions about it and he wrote this to respond to her, objections, to the Copernican theory, and to this whole question, of of the goal, of theology, and, what we would call science. um, so he certainly felt that it was worthwhile doing so. he also felt that this would s- in responding to her, he would this would be a way of responding to his critics, and that, and that she would be an appropriate person because she had a certain amount of influence and power and authority, in, among the governing circles. so i think on a whole, the fact that it's addressed to her, is much more important, than this particular, this particular passage. but isn't he actually contradicting himself? cuz he is he, in on the one hand he's trying to, use, her authority and her influence, yes i'm not certain that the quotation from, from Jerome, is intended to make precisely that point or whether it's intended to make another point. um entertainment entertainment value. i don't read it but i know a lot of people who do, (okay) oh God one out of three? yeah. are our papers graded yet? uh i have read the papers, i am not done with them, because, i had to do something, that i regret, that i didn't used to do but i now have to do, which is to check for plagiarism. and that requires, uh there're a couple of... i- i won't talk about the, techniques. i'm sorry i've had, in the last term i've had two cases. and the last time before that i had_ was in nineteen seventy-five. i'm profoundly disturbed by it, by the fact that i have to spend time doing this, and what it implies of course about our relationship. but but um, i've i've been (xx) i- i mean, i i'm i'm, i have nothing else on my agenda today but to finish off that. so you could stop_ what's tomorrow? tomorrow's Wednesday...? uhh, i've gotta come in tomorrow you could come by tomorrow and get 'em. or you could check with me late this afternoon. otherwise i'd bring 'em to the, to the exams. um, i i'm on the whole, uh well pleased. i'm on the whole well pleased... um... yes? just to double check the exam is in our regular room right? unfortunately the exam is in our regular room great    ten thirty to twelve thirty. ten thirty to twelve thirty. we're agreed on that? w- can we email you in the next two days or? yes but emailing me after the exam will not be_ you said the next two days yeah i will, let let let's do this. um, i tend to look at email first thing in the morning, and last thing at night so, if you have sent me a message, um, i will give you a relatively full answer i will do that for you but, um, you might wanna check, you know last thing Wednesday night. um, or just  	1
LEL280JG051.json	model, which uh, we started talking about last time   so shouldn't partials be_ have, opposite signs? ah, you're right. i got 'em backwards. so when the interest rate at home is high it's attractive so it comes in. good... thanks... so i i took my dollar, it bought this many pounds, grew with interest to this many pounds, multiply it by this, i'll get, dollars. the time is different by then, if i started at time T, it's now time T plus delta. i can put a T on this one... alright. well let's think about this for a minute. what happens when the expectations are heterogeneous? if uh, this announces that i'm going to at this point, is uh simpler than that it's as if everybody has common, expectations if they're different, it'll be more complicated. if you think the return abroad is better, you'll be investing there if i think the return at home is better i'll be investing here, then uh, uh the model becomes more complicated and we hafta worry about, how much heterogeneity there is and, who's thinking what. but it's simpler than that i'm assuming everybody has a point estimate the same one, of uh E dot over E. so that would be A? over E yeah i made it A i used to use E. so i meant A for anticipated. because this, to know how the uh, exchange rate is gonna change i have to think ahead. remember the derivative... do you, sort of assume that there are flexible exchange rates abroad. i mean because you have nine the balance of payments, items? i'm assuming that this, R, adjusts, and uh P and P-F are exogenous so i'm assuming that the E implicitly adjusts, to make that foreign exchange rate, uh, or to make the foreign exchange market, in my picture from the first day, balance. so that the inflow and outflow of dollars inflow and outflow of pounds from that, foreign exchange market, balance. yes... so there's the model. nine elements, three endogenous variables, three conditions here for equilibrium. i think i think i think you're missing a star in, element four yep. good. thanks. well um, i'm looking at the, yeah number one and it says R equals R-F plus theta yeah it's because that C-F because, the foreign and do- and domestic, financial assets are perfect substitutes, that, if i, if i changed R by any, uh finite amount nonfinitess- noninfinitessimal amount, uh, i'd hafta get an infinite change, in C-F. and that could, if i was at equilibrium before i could never be, at equilibrium thereafter. but the thing is, it's perfectly elastic, so it was it had become a correspondence that C-F could be anything, as long as, number one holds. so, this is where the story uh, sorta breaks down. i don't actually need to get any, noninfinitessimal change in R just, uh you could think of it as just going down infinitesimally. but it actually, C-F is so, elastic it actually doesn't even need to change at all... would the uh model also assume that domestic saving is not sensitive to, domestic interest rates? yep. so that you mean uh, uh private savings saving by Americans that, S-star thing, depended only on current, income flow in this model. so it's only on Y which is, interpreted as factor payments in that case, plus factor payments from abroad plus transfers from government minus taxes. so it's a very simple model savings behavior only your current flow, of uh resources, uh, and the interest rates are, your interest income is in that it's in the Y, but only that, determines how much you're saving. so in a more realistic model you might think, if the interest rate is higher i'll save more... but in this model it's it's too simple for that. but we'll come to more elaborate dynamic models later when, things like that will matter. so what's the motivation for Y increase in the star (xx) when actually there's no increase in R? because, to maintain equilibrium after i've increased M, the C-F has gotta go down... and that means there's less, uh money coming in, uh and from the, uh, balanced payments accounting identity, N-X has gotta, has gotta get bigger and counterbalance that. the N-F-P is exogenous. so, from the balanced payments accounting identity,  but how can you have a finite decrease of C-F? C-F is a correspondence. it's, C-F-star... 	1
LES500SU102.json	that too you need that. (this) yeah.  do you want us to bring both books like everyday? definitely you'll probably wanna bring your reader okay Bernie if you wanna come over here so you can yeah okay, you wanna stop it here?  yeah cuz i had, stress fractures in my feet   i don't_ it was it was kinda like Kool-aid and so- it was so weird but it tasted good. um, maybe you can get some for class. uh so they put radioactive isotopes in a liquid. and you drink them. the way it works on the brain, this is absolutely amazing. there is glucose in this radioactive i- isotope and glucose is something your body metabolizes when it's metabolizing actively. they then, um, give people mental tasks, while they have their head in a CAT scan, something like a CAT scan, machine. and when your brain is working different parts of your brain work to do different tasks, but when your brain is working, it metabolizes glucose, and so in those areas that are metabolizing more glucose you get a concentration of radioactivity. and basically it looks like the weather charts when you're watching to see if a storm is coming through you know how they get the radar and they've got the, the thunderstorm is where there's the red and then it goes from there, that's exactly what it looks like in the brain and we'll, i'll show you that. and so you can really see if people's brains are working right, by seeing which parts are using the most glucose at the right time, and if the right parts are using glucose, at the right time. uh, and so this can be hugely helpful in, not only looking at the physical structure of the brain which is what the M-R-I can do, but in looking at the actual functioning of a- of a living brain as it's actually functioning. um, let me show you uh a couple of the segments, they have um, i think the second one shows, a schizophrenic person who is, um supposed to be doing a task and his brain does not light up in the right ways. which is a hint, um, as to what may happen in schizophrenia, with brain processes. this is the schizophrenic man. so now this is just_ looks at soft structure it doesn't look at functioning, but this is the X-ray of, soft tissue. i'm gonna stop it there. isn't that amazing. i just, think that's unbelievable 	1
STP165JG122.json	okay Rebecca. yes. um enter or space bar or, okay  arrow (that's okay)  M too?  oh okay. or plus or minus. uh page up page down that's a good one that's what i i think that's like too many choices for me.  just one comment that, uh the Pathfinder from what i understand is pretty cool, uh  yeah i mean i think if, if um you needed that device, eight thousand dollars, i mean in a way it's like, what's money? but, you know if you really  mm  yay gee i don't remember too many other people getting applause. you're just extra special. oh okay. let's see, so alright. okay i'm curious how do you connect eight different switches to that machine? you connect eight switches through either_ i think it's this one. y uhuh yeah. yeah it it's actually_ they had um, a price for, the eight different switch is a hundred and twenty-five dollars for the extra large (targets) i think that's why we don't have (xx) yeah 	1
COL999MX059.json	before we begin Hank Rushbauh is an employee at the university, he's not just an outsider and a very good friend of, Harvey's, so. alright i'd like to introduce Harvey Banks, who is a, very good friend. and basically Harvey is a computer maven. everything for computers, you call Harvey Harvey knows what to do um, Harvey works at the Business School in their computer lab. and, is the person that everybody calls when there's any problem and Harvey knows what to do and how to solve the problem. but that's not all Harvey does. Harvey also works with businesses to help them set up their computer programs particularly databases, for businesses. and he also has a few hobbies and if you'd like to get to know Harvey well, you might ask him how he's doing in his boat race. so i'd like to, welcome Harvey Banks to the E-L-I. thank you Harvey. thank you Renee. well, this uh, presentation really has its origins a long long way back. the origins of the whole concept, really went back to the nineteen fifties. but i won't bother with too much of the history, i'll just tell you what it is i'm trying to do... most of my life has been spent, solving problems. and many many years ago a, published mathematician and i, decided to see if we could, formalize this and put some rigor into the whole thing, and, to this end, we looked at what was available, and we actually found that there was nothing that would communicate, the problem or its solution, to the users. so what we did is we evolved, a mechanism for ourselves, using, um, some quite, heavy mathematical techniques but found that this was, no good because it really didn't satisfy the users' needs. and, over the years, we, adapted things that already existed, to our needs. the thing that we're going to use, i'll show you later on but i'm going to talk about the whole idea of solving problems. let me first start there, with some very simple things. when do solutions to problems fail? well every time i go in and i work with some group they'll tell me oh that can never happen... problem, solutions fail when things that can never happen do. and believe me, that's much more often than people realize. they also fail, when there're just plain omissions, things that were, just not not, considered. and when these things that are not considered, arise, then of course the solution fails. three  would you like to entertain any questions? yes i'll entertain any questions i'm dying to ask you a question yes? you had in the one table this category, invalid month. and i'm really bothered by that  no. but people will do that. oh.  so, okay, so that's   i'll go even further. have you had error messages on your computer that say, uh you're out of disk space? mhm ninety percent of the time it's rubbish.   ninety percent of the time it's rubbish. what it is, is somebody's detected a problem, and the only alternative we had was one of these messages and he throws it up on the screen. and it's erroneous and it's misleading. you must deal as explicitly with errors as you deal with non-errors. so for instance if i tell you, you have an invalid month, that's what you have. i don't just say oh your date's wrong... there's nothing more frustrating than computer system messages  uh you said it's very important to define your problem space, how do you know that you've got everything yes, okay, the process of drawing one of these tables, is the stimulus to your intuition. you will draw up this table, and then you'll look at it and say, you know there's another condition that we haven't considered and immediately you have to populate your table with that condition. and i'll tell you how i do it. i start in the top left-hand corner and i start drawing a table. and then i get one of these insights, and i stop. and i used to write myself a cryptic note, on the table i was busy with explaining why i stopped. and i found out don't write a cryptic note, write a very full note about why you stopped. because if you don't when you try and reconstruct it later you won't know why you did it. and so i would start, and i'd number, the sheet. i'd number it one two three four and i'd put a date on it. and every time i stopped, because i had one of these insights, and let me tell you when you have a complete problem space you know you've got a complete problem space. boy do you know it. it it, it feels good. i'll show you something. and you'll you'll get the picture. i'm go on.   go ahead go yeah i was um, wondering cuz you were talking about writing foolproof software, and as we all know, um absolutely, we've  he wouldn't be a very good guinea pig for  i have one question yes. um maybe it doesn't make sense but um, if there is an answer, would it be better to start at one end than the other? do you have, con- a certain number of outcomes that can happen the actions that can happen, let's say that number's X and you have a certain number of, conditions that can get you to those actions, if then (call them Y.) is it better to start with the smaller end the bigger end? um, i actually address that in the paper. that, uh is available here.  it turns out that, there are no blocks here. and in fact, don't worry about covering the whole problem. just start. (so just) remember you can permute it, and you can change the order and you can do anything you want post facto, but just start. but it  for example in our trying to place students and figuring out, we we had certain criteria, we know their placement score, on the written part and the oral part and all the different parts, that enters into it. whether they're an undergrad or or a grad student enters into it maybe Phd  possible placements may be fewer. the outcomes ye- yeah     yeah so so if we were doing, yep so if we were doing that kind of a table, we would actually, create one column that would say, maybe courses that we don't have to offer, simply because that would account for errors is that, is that wha-  right okay  i said that there are 	1
STP095SU139.json	very exciting panel. ah the panel is gonna focus mostly on the Freedomways readings, so i just wanted to do a little bit of a preview, for you setting the stage um, mostly drawing on the Simmons reading but just on some other, general, um civil rights history. so Freedomways was established in what year? (nineteen sixty-one) nineteen sixty-one. okay. so what's happening in nineteen sixty-one, in, the United States? the civil rights movement the civil rights movement. okay. particularly we've already had the Montgomery Bus Boycott, okay that's happened, the sit-in movement has started, alright, uh Brown-v-Board was a long time before that nineteen fifty-four, so nineteen sixty-one is really in the middle, of all of the intense activities of the civil rights movement, um so the civil rights movement is really rolling we're going towards Freedom Summer, you're starting to have more interaction between, black activists and white, progressive activists who want to become part of the movement, mhm okay. um, we would like to welcome everybody to the unveiling, of the new Freedomways two. okay, well, i wrote an, i'm writing a article, about, whether or not um, the issues that blacks faced in the past whether they're problematic today, and, first i wanna start off by talking about, the article that Dubois had in the first Freedomways and the issues that, he discussed. and i'm gonna put a picture up of him... you can use the chalkboard actually. okay. does everybody understand what caste means? no no. um, do you wanna explain that or do you want me to explain that? (that's fine) a caste system is where your class and your ethnic group or your religious group or whatever other kind of cultural group you're, part of get collapsed together so, caste is another way of saying second-class citizenship but based on this combination of economic and cultural factors. so, in India, they talk about the caste system cuz it's based on, um, what region you're from, and what level of society you're put in given your religion, your economic position and your skin color all, glommed together. so, Dubois and some other sociologists like to refer to the American, uh racial system as also a caste system, because it determines so many things in your life. okay, and he also spoke about how there was limited employment (xx) yeah. so, if you think that this is still a, a problem today, i want you to, um (do we stand up?) maybe we   (xx) (stand up) can i get on one side of the room so we can see like who moves and who doesn't? okay everybody move like over here, to  everyone on that side of the room (xx) to this side? what? so then like if they agree, oh okay okay if, you think that it is still problematic today i want you to cross the line and go to the other  voting rights voting rights.  (i'm in the) middle. so if you're  unsure you're in the   right okay you're like middlers? or yeah,  okay. and i just i just want us to discuss this like, why are you guys in the middle and why are some of you feel that, it is problematic today? anybody? just wait a minute, let me think about it. i just think that it's still a problem today because some of the same things that went on like, in the past or whatever or back when blacks were first like going through all the things with like the literacy tests or having to do all the things they had to do to vote in the first place are things th- are going on now not that we have to take tests or whatever, now or whatever but, things such as the things that they say happened in Florida or the unfairness or people not being able to like register to vote are still some of the problems that happened to people back, before (the) civil rights. okay i also think like where they uh, set up uh, sometimes where they set up the places to vote are not very uh, uh, people friendly, (that has to travel towards) like, dependent on, where you live, or what neighborhood you're from. (it's not good, it's) i think like the actual rights are there so it's like technically, blacks have the rights but there is like all these other loopholes that they throw in like, you know like a a lotta um, there's a large percentan of_ percentage of black males incarcerated, who who can't, who do, who don't have the right to vote, so, their their jo- i think that they're i- t- twisting it around now and finding different ways to take your vote away. or not market towards black. (xx) why are you all in the middle? Amber down here (xx) um i'm in the middle because, it doesn't happen to me so, it's hard for me to understand. so i don't- i don't wanna be over there, where i can say like it's fine because i can't say that, and i can't say that, there is a problem because i don't know. it's because, it doesn't happen to me. and it doesn't mean that i should be deaf to it but, that's, why i have to be in the middle. mhm. others? i'm in the middle bec- like i agree, a lot with what (Julia) said like, the rights are there but, i've heard of problems with like, people actually being turned away cuz polls close too early cuz they can't accommodate, the amount of people and stuff like that, but, yeah. they other middlers? yeah, going off that like that d- didn't that even happen like in Detroit? yeah,  (Abigail?) well like um, in addition to the things like the election board officials, making like the rules of like um, when you can register how you can register who can vote you know what ways, the ballot's gonna be cast or whatever i do realize there are flaws in that, but i also realize coming from a um, place where it's predominantly black and all the elected officials (people) are black, that there's a general apathy in the community sometimes people, even if the poll is right there, one block away, people still don't go they don't take the vote seriously too so i also realize, that you know whether it be, misinformation, not enough education on the issues, that people, don't take advantage of, the (right that they're given). yeah i think it's think that kinda ties in to what i was saying earlier about how they're marketed. i think uh, if there, if there is this sense of apathy in the community i feel like a lot of people don't feel like their vote matters. you know what i mean? uh i mean, i f- it's kinda like you know, they're you know saying, uh... so it's made to feel as if they're like a minority and that their vote won't count.  okay wait  let's   okay having done that, i just wanted to, you guys pretty much touched base on it (though.) i want to throw up a article, about, the Florida vote. okay you guys can't see that can you? well i'll read it. (xx) (xx) you can just summarize it cuz we can't really read it. right. okay and, um, it was entitled Race in the Florida Vote and, some of the points that it made was that, a lotta minority voters, had registered and came out to vote but many of them were students but, they weren't allowed to vote, and or they were denied the chance to, cast in their ballots and some were told that, they were not registered some, did vote but their ballots were discarded because of faulty machines or confusing instructions, and um... uh, basically, s- some civil rights officials were saying that, minorities, um, it was harder for members of minorities than for whites to cast their, ballots, their (cast) ballots, excuse me their votes. and um, mostly this happened in Florida and it said that a, high percentage of black voters were required to use, cheaper less efficient punchcard systems to register their choices, while whites tended to vote in more affluent districts, with more reliable optical scanning systems. and computers were not available in many black precincts, to help clear up the problems that, um, when they said that w- that they weren't registered, and, many voters were, they had to call it in lines were busy so many voters just gave up and went home, and, the N-C-double-A pres- N-C-double-A president said that, N-C, it's okay i just have a question about, whether it's, conscious, people trying to, suppress the black vote, or whether it's just a, um, whether it's just... i- it's it's just like a a symptom of, a symptom of the problem like people are actually, i i like i, although i agree that it's, it's unfair towards blacks i, have trouble thinking that people are actually consciously saying, okay let's make sure that they're, worse machines and let's close the polls a little bit earlier. a- a- a- and i would th- just- bec- i listened to a lot on the radio when they were doing the the, the original voting and there w- there was a big debate over over voter responsibility, and where was the line between, when voters just weren't educated e- educating themselves about, the the voting, mhm that um, that makes me ask like, two questions like um, one is it less of a problem if it isn't a conscious decision but it is a a strong reality? like, i- should the question be like is it conscious? or should the question be like, you know what is the problem? how do we solve the problem? like a lot of things, have been unco- you know a lot of, instances of racism or, discrimination or whatever have been, not exactly like, acts of volition and then the second question, that it makes me raise, is that, if we as a society, realize that the- these are, problems now and we then choose not to do anything about it and then we then n- choose not to ask the questions that, are arising then then does it become like, a cognizant effort to like, not deal with the problem? because we're aware of the problem when we don't deal with it. also that's a good point is that now that they're_ the problem is known and that it disproportionately affects people of color, now that we know that if we don't, solve it then, it is_ we've made a nondecision that is a decision that has racial implications. the second thing is is that some of the other things in that article that Martine didn't mention is that, state troopers stopped vans that had been_ carpools that had been organized, to bring elderly black voters and people without cars to the polls and they said, oh you're acting as a taxi you don't have a taxi license, and they gave them a ticket and they set up blockades, in front of, in the, in the routes to the polling places, and they only stopped, black, filled cars. um they also asked, election officials asked black voters for I-D, which you don't need. and if they didn't have it they wouldn't let them vote but then the white person behind them was not asked for any identification. um, so, smaller scale very deliberate, um s- instances have been documented of people i mean there was actually a white reporter, who was at a polling place just doing the basic, it's election day i'm gonna be at this polling place and a couple black people said come over here and film this, and the election officials ran her out, of, the polling station, and, she went back to her station and tried to report this, and state troopers followed her all the way back to her station. and she testified for the N-double-A-C-P hearing. so it was, both a mix of deliberate, and nondeliberate actions, that prosu- produced the result of (in Florida.) (can you run) this? okay. thank you...  thanks Martine. um in the same manner that blacks wanted to be able to vote and be accepted in the public sphere, black entertainers were looking for acceptance in their line of work as well. (Len) Fernando, part owner and senior editor of Black Hair magazine discusses blacks in the entertainment industry...  hello everybody... um how many of, you have heard of Ruby Dee...? oh really that's it? okay um, how many of, you have seen Do the Right Thing...? Jungle Fever...? and more recently Baby Geniuses...? Felicia Rashad, from The Cosby Show Cosby Show, okay, another? Jada Pinkett Jada Pinkett from what role do you know her, most famously? um, oh my god i forgot the name of the show. Different World? Different World, that's it. Different World, okay, Jimmy? Sanaa Lathan, um Love and Basketball, Best Man okay uh, Disappearing Acts too okay. anybody else have any, actresses in mind? um Angela Bassett, just, a bunch of things um, How Stella Got Her Groove Back um, Vampire in Brooklyn Angela Bassett okay see going, going through my mind talking with the members of my group it was really hard for me, or hard for us to have a straight list of, black actresses that are, so well known that are, mainstream even or that have, won awards, Emmys Oscars Academy Awards, what have you does anybody know any black actors or actresses who have won Academy Awards? Den- Whoopi Goldberg Denzel Denzel Washington yeah Halle Berry won a Golden Globe right Academy Awards  BAPS    horrid Bulworth  whoa well, if you think about it in terms of, Academy Awards, you can put three names under, four names under the black people who've won Academy Awards for acting, four out of, four and, and the Academy Awards have been on for m- seventy or more years, and i tried to look up like the archive, actresses or black actors that have won, and it's, there's, little to none, like, acknowledgment or acceptance of black actors. and even have you_ like even saying that, um the article At the Emmys, Ruby Dee is, talking about, um her, nomination for an Emmy Award. and how she says, she's thinking she's in the audience and she says (xx) (i think show the) (xx) okay, alright if everyone can stand up again everybody go back so given Ruby Dee's arguments and some of the things discussed just here, the question is okay first question basically is, um do you think, um the opportunities in the entertainment, um, in the entertainment sphere, have improved, gotten worse or remained the same?    and in the same in the middle and about the same in the middle or not sure, in the middle since Ruby Dee? since Ruby Dee. since Ruby Dee. you guys gotta, spread out so we know what's what like who's where.  so over here is improvement. roles and opportunities have improved, roles and des- (depictions) opportunities have gotten worse, not sure or they're about the same... okay who's_ this is all improved? this is the center? are you gotten  see_ no see i'm on the cusp, yeah i'm  alright Tiffany why do you feel, that, it hasn't even gotten any better there's been no  yeah because they still, will not do, a good black drama. where you see, a black family for real, in the situations of everyday life. they have to always comedy it up, and that's why in my mind that, it still_ cuz they won't, they_ you never see the real truth. you always see gloss pictures Moesha, that's not the truth. tha- that, ooh she irks me.  yes   okay. now i have a question for you though. did you like Waiting to Exhale? did i like Waiting t- no cuz i thought them women were dumb.      she was crazy  and is she really gonna go start stalking after Martin Lawrence? let's   stayed the same, are or are the same. people in the middle? i'm kinda borderline stayed the same, gotten worse cuz um, i was about to say if you, i mean, if you wanna compare it to like the minstrel times of course it has gotten better but, when you think about it it really hasn't because our society has changed so much.  mhm mhm  has it improved?   oh well no i was thinking that like, of course it's gotten better. you know, mhm what about improvement? i wouldn't say definite you used the word definite improvement and, that's totally not out there and, so i guess somewhere i should be on the line between improvement and somewhat stayed the same, because, you've gotten to the point where at this time, black actresses are, being pulled into, mainstream, movies and television roles but at the same time, there hasn't been that many of them it's a i- it's been a very very slow process and_ while at the same time it's it's interesting um, just throwing out an example Lela Rochon i believe, some movie she was in, just in she was talking about where she's paired as the lead against, a white actor, and, when it was originally written there was supposed to be a romantic interest there but, once they put her there as the lead actress, romantic interest goes out the way- out the window so, i think while there has been some, very small gradual improvement there's still, a lot that needs to be done. other improvement? i agree that there's, definitely a long way to go, but i definitely think there's been a lot of improvement especially over just the last decade. you know we moved from, Nell Carter and uh, (i can't remember the name of the show) Gimme a Break Gimme a Break, to you know, um the Wayans Brothers and shows on um, you know (xx) okay   yeah cuz then again  yeah cuz  i think that you made a good point that like when we're talking about television and then, like when we talk about how, like, television shows that reflect black life don't, accurately reflect black life that television is not an accurate representation of life anyway so i think that that was a very important point that you, brought up a moment ago.    not yet... i know, i know. okay right now i'm just gonna show you a um, two clips, two different clips actually um, one discussing, uh one o- actually one of 'em's called Ethnic Notions and it's discussing, like the history of um, black entertainment and how they were portrayed, in films. like the minstrelsy the mammys and, um, see the evolution in the second clipping, of, black entertainment. black entertainers in general um, and black actors and actresses and see maybe, a like, if there has been a change, and see if, you guys, wanna cross the line. yeah just (put it in.) this next tape is kinda shaky but it just shows like, some more images and, some also like current images today that you see on television, that kind of resemble or (xx) okay now, after seeing all that, have people's, sentiments about black, entertainer entertainers in general changed? do people still think it's gotten better or, do people? and think about too like those like that_ images that weren't even on there cuz that tape's kinda old i think but think about like, the Wayans Brothers how they just make a fool of themselves on T-V the P-Js, who's just like, black minstrels, for the two (G...) (xx) i did have one thing to say like that some of those like, are are c- comedies and they were like meant to be that and they w- we have like some black serious roles that like counteract that, just (like) people would say something (if we wanted to do the same thing) and show like white actors people would say that Jim Carrey or somebody represented, you know the best of what like white actors could (be) that was just well we_ like, we're saying like we understand, like but the difference between like black actors and actresses and the white actors and actresses is that they're represented in a full spectrum and, like we as a uh a black like black people are not represented in that full spectrum, that we don't get, like, most of our, black men you can, like, a interesting thing would be count the number of serious roles and movies that black have played and then the number of roles that black men have played that are like, the Chris Tucker role and, the Martin Lawrence roles, that we see, on_ at like, the movies that come out. i agree i was just saying   (anything that you wanna add?) uh maybe this is a good topic for later, like larger discussion but i also think you have to look, with both of these questions if have to look at like the larger context and with these, with the voting and with the entertainment (industry) it's like, of course there're gonna be int- improvements in the black industry because, there are more people who own theaters like Magic, or people who can produce their own films and stuff like that so of course you're gonna get a different portrayals and saying that there's not, any improvement at all it's just like ridiculous you know you can't, discredit like a Cicely Tyson, and Sounder and those other films that just, made a definite impact in h- showing drama without any, comedic aspects you know i mean, i think we can just say that just because (wasn't blew up) in the mainstream you know, and there are plenty of films that open, that don't get any support, from the audience at all and they have to close cuz you know, nobody goes to see them. i just wanted to say that like when we look at, like, the images of, like since you brought up like the images of like blacks versus whites, in the media and, like, you know what we see like i think that, indistinguishable from those roles, are, the control of, these images. black people, do not tend to, control the images of black people and i think that, like that's something to take into consideration. not that i'm clai- like, s- i feel like there's a difference n- now between, like the, buffoonery or whatever you wanna, say, today because there is, like a choice involved with it whereas in the past there wasn't necessarily that choice, but like i- you can't, i don't think you can talk about these issues without, talking about like who is controlling the images that we see... well i was gonna say the same thing because, well i was gonna ask, the question like you keep bringing up the Wayans Brothers like i don't watch it but, i, what i gather is, i- no one's making them do this this is like what they wanna do you know but then, we see these tapes of like, you know a w- long time ago and pe- like they_ you you're right that they didn't have the choice to do this like people, this was their way of like, not being like asleep or whatever you know this was their way of breaking out, and they did whatever they had to do to, you know if they even if they didn't approve of it or if they you know if it wasn't what they wanted to do they did it anyway but now i- i feel like, unless i'm wrong correct me if i am cuz i don't     yeah but     mhm does  he doesn't own a, studio,  Quincy Jones?    John Singleton Robert Townsend John Singleton Robert Townsend okay we've got three black men here. Hughes brothers Gina uh (Pricewood,)  the Hughes brothers the Hughes brothers the Hughes brothers. okay what movies have they put out in the last, five years?  besides Spike she said? besides Spike   John Singleton did put out a movie that i was surprised that he directed but i don't think he was (xx). his last movie uh um Rosewood? John Single- (uh in) i think he had one after that he had one after that.    it didn't have any    and they produced or co-produced um, Scary Movie. right. (xx) well i know it, wasn't the best (portrayal) but it was a big hit. no i'm just saying it is a big hit i mean there's a there's a couple of, questions i just wanna unravel then before we move to the next point, about control so we had a hard time, there are no black movie studios that, independently produce, films. even Spike Lee's films are in conjunction, with Paramount. i believe. so, in terms of who has the money, to produce film and who owns the studio space, and everything like that, that's all basically white folks. but but can we really name, white people who own those companies (too?) but they own 'em   no but they  well think about Steven Spielberg's company, think about Zanuck think about Michael Eisner who owns Disney A-B-C, and, that includes Miramax and Touchstone and Miramax's head is Harvey Weinstein, i mean i've just rattled off six or seven names of, of  mhm mhm (xx) i can name someone who used to. who used to. Dustin Nguyen he was on SeaQuest okay on SeaQuest, well SeaQuest got dumped. mhm it was good. yeah it was good. so if you think of it in those terms future? no, (wasn't,) Deep Space Nine    so if you think in these terms, not just black white but, all peoples of all colors, um, you know, Asian people got money Latino people got money black people got money all of us watch T-V... you know you're all here in this class together, no big problem. minorities watch more T-V, than, white people. exactly so, the W-B and U-P-N and Fox couldn't have been successful without minority viewers because they were, putting on Martin they were putting on In Living Color and this, drew huge audiences, completely mixed so, but still it seems like U-P-N and W-B are the two networks where you can o- a- the only two where you can consistently find, casts with, lots of black faces. rather than just one here one there, you know, doctor Peter what's-his-face on E-R or, Gideon or whatever so, if you think of it in more global terms and you think about the, kind of decisionmaking processes that are behind, um, economic and cultural decisionmaking processes, it's pretty clear from the research that i know that, if you're thinking in terms of proportionality if you think in terms of economics, that there's really no concrete reason why we don't see a more multicultural media landscape in terms of the mainstream. and that's nothing for anybody to feel guilty about personally but it's something to think about, in terms of your consumption habits. so, let us move on, to, our next, set. okay, and kinda tying in um, with what we were just talking about like, um, in the nineteen sixty-six number one reader that's in your uh, in your coursepack, um Sarah Wright, noted that um one can hardly pick up a book which does not advertise naked or suggestively naked um, African-American women and, we just happen to have the Vibe magazine like, sittin' up here Amber's gonna use it for her presentation, and i just started flipping through the magazine and, like i just found so many, like, just, suggestively, just African-American women like and this is, a magazine that's targeted at, African-American yeah African-American but, all through the magazine there's pictures like this there's, pictures with less less clothing on. um, she also notes that in popular music of our time, it is in what she calls a, supreme state of chaos and she says that, the reduction of women in song to mere sexual animals, is at um, is at a the point beyond which it could go no further so she's saying like   it's a she was saying. or she was saying,  Paule that's okay. 	1
LAB575JU095.json	like i said i don't know if the word interested is, probably the best forced (would be better) you kn- uh, what? go what do you mean? twentieth right? yeah okay, go,  alright go   i mean it would be easy for me to borrow it then because we're already setting up a day yes no problem that's good (xx)  what is the answer? the probability of, neither May, oh, neither, okay oh okay idiots two um, if you switch. i don't_ i'm just guessing. okay, two point, remember point two,  switch and then switch, you win i'll just have you point yeah i have all, the other ones... and then, switch you win... switch you win wow so wait, if you switch it aren't you gonna win every time? i don't know, because not if no. cuz if i pick oh if you pick the, the  mhm yeah you win. wow... that one, switch. win i'm pretty good at this   that must be a win and that one the middle one? yeah, that one. so you win. yeah, so you  that's another win alright see lose oh, okay  the middle one i'm sorry  that one, but then you  so, this one? right then switch so i lose. so you lo- uh this one  middle one i'll show you this one,  um, that one.  you win. i have two more, five six seven eight, yeah two more. that one. you win. i can just, uh, middle one. you win. alright, so we have eight wins, two loss, or i mean, no we have  did you, you didn't get five a minute ago, did y- did you? no, i didn't you got like, two or three i think. yeah, okay yeah alright so three, and you had all,  yup oh that's what it's, switching we're down here. that's, yeah that's the probability of winning when you switch the door, oh i (get it) eighty-five percent oh really? so they said that  yeah yeah. but when you s-   so then you have a better chance if you switch it. yeah  oh this weather is horrible. hm? i know it's supposed to be summer.  are you staying here both_ for both spring and summer  where do you live? i live, up in Traverse City. okay, let's tally our results and see, empirically, what the answers should be. okay so groups that stayed, how many did you guys get, Anne Marie, how many did you get? eight  twelve, or_ to stay, right? okay, one, two, six, twelve... guys in the back eight. eight. guys in front. seven. seven, six seven. so we had, thirty-five, thirty-five wins. this is, out of there was four groups so it was out of eighty total. now let's do switch. uh, what'd you guys get right there? right here? eleven eleven... eleven, yeah seventeen seventeen, wow... seventeen, okay you guys. eleven eleven. one, two  thirteen thirteen   thirteen thirteen, one two oops, three four five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. is that everyone? (looks like that's everyone) five ten fifteen twenty, sixty-five. this is out of a hundred cuz we have five groups. okay so now we can calculate these, empirical probabilities. i can do the one in my head, i don't think i can do the other one. let's see. so let's see we have, thirty-five out of eighty. wow that's pretty good. four-three-five, and this one i can guess is (four-six-five.) okay? so now if you if you listen to the numbers posted we had a lot of, pretty big ones for switching. and actually it is, true. switching does help you win. you win, two-thirds of the time, as opposed to one-third of the time, if you stay. and i'll just show you really fast why. i think some of the groups figured it out, fairly quickly, okay. so let's just say for instance, door one is the car, so goat, goat. okay. if, if you pick door one, and you stay, you would win. okay? so if you stay, and you picked one, you picked door one, you would win, you pick door two you'd lose, pick door three you would lose. okay? now if you switch... and you pick door one, okay you pick door one. okay? ga- Monty Hall's gonna show you door two. you're gonna switch over to door three, but you're gonna lose. you're gonna get a goat, so you'd lose. if you pick door two initially, pick door two Monty Hall's gonna show you door three. okay? cuz that's the losing one. you ca- and you're gonna switch over back to door one, so you're gonna switch over to a win. and if you pick door three, Monty Hall's gonna show you door two, which is a loss, but you're gonna switch over, and you'll win. so, the actual probabilities, you're gonna win two-thirds of the time that you switch, and you're gonna win one-third of the time, if you stay. that's the empir- that's the actual probabilities. empirically we can see, we're pretty close here, point-six-five is really close to, two-thirds. um, point-four-seven-five, i- again it's kind of big, but we had one group that was really really big, so that's why i think, that that happened to be, little bit higher than than it did. if we did more repetitions obviously we only did eighty repetitions if we did you know, two three thousand, we'd get numbers really close to one-third, and two-thirds. okay? so basically, does everyone see why, it pays to switch? okay? so if you're ever on the game show you know you should always switch. basically the only way you win, if you stay, is if you happen to guess correctly, initially, and get the car right away. if you're switching, the only way you lose is if you guess correctly right away. so, it's kinda, it's kinda weird the way that that works. so, when you switch, when you when your strategy's switching, you really wanna guess the wrong door, initially, then you're gonna, win once you switch. so, and the thing is you've got a greater chance, of picking the wrong door than picking the right door, initially, so that's why, it's always better to have, switching rather than staying. let's see. what else do we have here? number of wins using this. what did you estimate the probability of this (xx) what strategy appears to be best again, switching is the best, just because we can show empirically it's better, and we (can) show actually it's better. now if you go on the web page, the Stat one-hundred web page, under i think other information, maybe, i think it's there. they have on there an actual article by, statisticians and mathematicians arguing this exact problem. i mean they have nothing to do in their free time other than, arguing this particular problem, but you you get really you know, well known statisticians actually arguing that it's better to stay, rather than switch. and we could show right here, you know, within you know, half an hour that it's, it's better to switch. even just doing it empirically it's better to switch, than it is to stay. you can show it, actually fairly easily in this problem. okay? so, let's see what time we've got, any questions from the lab? any questions...? ah, let's do a homework problem. someone pick a homework problem we'll do it... just cuz, we have very little time left. (you just freaked us out) that was the highlight of my day  Eminem now eight-thirty. eight-three-oh? three-oh thank you. what page is that on? three-ninety-four three-ninety-four. let's see. are we supposed to do that one? mhm is tha- is that assigned? yeah yeah it is... it's the one with the random distribution. i just didn't know, i know well that's what i had a question on too, so yeah i know, like, (i can never pay attention) i know okay, so it says how about a graphed one at the end? which one? one of those graphed ones at the end? it might have been in the next chapter. yeah i'm not sure_ graphed? there's some, well reading graphs and stuff. oh, you mean like reading um, let's see. they're probably in like, like in nine-nine-two or something. (xx) do you have a page number maybe on that? uh it's four-thirty, four-thirty-four,  nine-two. okay, we could do that.  you're doing nine-two? yeah nine-point-two, page uh, three-fifty-four. i don't wanna give you guys the wrong answer, wrong uh definition for biased, unbiased sorry... oh unbiased sure. is that C, wait was that C? yeah. estimator three has the lowest, overall variability, even though it might not be on target. or wholly on target. 	1
LEL175JU112.json	there's just one handout today on the lecture, and the exam's coming up, Wednesday, uh do you have any questions, coming up, on the exam? the review will be tonight, uh bring questions to the review cuz you'll really generate, uh, you know what information is given out, so, do that, uh go over your study questions, that you got there's there's example exams, on the web or on the web page for two eighty-one, and uh, i looked over the the first exam and this, the population stuff is on there, but there's a foraging problem and obviously, we haven't talked about foraging so, don't worry about things that we haven't discussed at all. so, any questions (coming up?) everyone's is the exam is in this building? exam will be here in this room at this time, and uh you'll be handed out the exam that you write on so you don't need to bring uh books or anything no calculators. be no need for calculators you can just show all your work and uh, so no calculators yeah? is today's lecture on the exam? i'm sorry what? is today's lecture on the exam? uh oh. good question i'm sorry it is not on the exam. okay? it will include up to last Wednesday's lecture. good questions. do you have any of the handouts that are, outside your office, (xx) oh uh, i don't. if there we're missing some handouts that people need i guess the best thing is to tell me or email me and i could try to xerox some more but, i don't. um they're all there outside the door. basically. but if we're missing something i could try to replace them. or you could get them you know maybe from somebody (xx) okay so everyone's all set? for Wednesday? okay well today, i'm going to talk about population regulation. we've been talking about populations, demography, life histories, and uh, when I talk about population growth i showed you, uh this figure, where if we look at the patterns of population growth for different species, uh we find in some cases we do get a nice logistic pattern, where we have the model that fit very nice where the species grows to a carrying capacity, and then settles down around this equilibrium, but more often what we see are, populations that fluctuate, but around some, sorta K value or at least some, uh asymptote here. and the populations fluctuate within bounds. and this is what we mean by regulation. that is there's some factor that's causing the population, to stay within bounds rather than, completely crashing and going extinct, or going into exponential growth, uh indefinitely. and, uh we saw this then in the logistic equation, our population increases, up to this K, and stays there. and if the population, uh for some reason goes above K, then our little density-dependent term, will become negative and it'll start going down if it's below K, this'll be positive and growth will pu- put it back up to K. so we have an equilibrium, then.    	1
DIS495JU119.json	alright so maybe we should get started with culture. we talked a little bit about culture last time what did we say it was?  okay so it's, something that helps you interpret your experience doesn't it kind of give a um, a basis of like what's right and wrong and how you should like judge your, (like) what you do what's acceptable in life (and) norms? yeah that's the  they have different beliefs, different  beliefs about what? beliefs about everything about, religion about... everything. what (makes) right and what's wrong. you can even tie in that uh, article in the Voices of Dissent (kind of,) the different (culture war,) like, they wouldn't_ they did things okay so culture is, shared? and then they violat- or they, go against, our culture  y- well yeah exactly they have different, cultural um, backgrounds and stuff. okay. so what about this, political culture stuff? political culture. yes, Hannah? um, i guess you would say it would be how, um, people, in- people interact with the government and how they feel about the government and, basically the government of a country, set sets the tone for the political culture of that country.  um political culture's like your values and beliefs and everything like like geared toward the, politics. so what's politics? stuff, that's political. (thoughts and stuff?) what's politics? Mark? um political culture, part of our political culture is freedom. oh part of  alright yes it's one of our uh, experiences. is that we experience freedom?   we do? belief... (xx) we might believe in freedom. strive maybe, cuz it's not necessarily   government is it just government...? remember we had this discussion on the very first day of class, and i said, this class  (xx) American government.  politics so what else did we talk about? Hannah? collective action collective action and getting collective goods for, everyone. and free riders and Mark's favorite, free riders. common goals... politics is all about how we deal with each other right? central to that idea would be what other big P word? power power, politics has to do with how we, distribute power, right? now some of that we do through government, right? that's what you've been, studying for a semester... but part of that we do what? ourselves ourselves ourselves Mark you are on a roll. he's on fire today... so (power)  it's like the methods in which we, interact with one another in order to attain power. no that sounds like politics. yeah. what was the question? what's political culture? it's the way we do it like, you know like the style, like our culture. do we agree with her? no (Adam?) um, it's our attitudes, or our um and our involvement in, in politics and, how we how we perceive this political system, okay maybe it has to do with, perceptions... Amy,  it's like our ideas and beliefs about what the government does and then what it shouldn't be doing. (xx) and where and where the power should be?   we want, representation. what do we want? what do we want from the government? collective goods. collective goods, we want stuff. we want free stuff. we want stuff we can't get by ourselves, right i have, yes yes i don't really understand how that, uh like i don't think that makes sense as political culture. why? i don't know. i just don't. i_ like i feel like culture should be like, what should culture be? i don't know. but like i understand like the attitudes and beliefs part but  so Professor Walton gave you the, example of the stop sign right? what's the stop sign example? (xx) well t- tell me what the example was somebody repeat it for me. it's like you jus- you just see the shape and then you automatically put your foot on the brake. why? uh i think he, if i remember correctly, if you happen to go through the stop sign, you immediately look around to see if anybody saw you, uh, violate a law. so what's the what's the point there? alright l- let's try this. what does a stop sign mean? to  what does a stop sign mean? to stop. what does a stop sign mean? stop. stop   (no) stop. okay. do we have some sort of agreement in here about what, the stop sign means?   how do we get that? culture stop sign it's in the name. okay what does a red light mean? (alright) that's better. what what does a red traffic light mean? it means you (should) stop stop okay what does a red traffic light mean? stop. Adam, what does a red traffic light mean yeah okay. is that better? (xx) so that's culture. so uh, so we all think it means the same thing? okay Brett so what happens if somebody comes from another country and tries to d- drive on our roads? uh they, might not necessarily understand, that the stop sign means, stop. yeah, or that a, a red traffic light means stop, right? or that we drive on the right side. or that we drive on the right side. is we drive on the right side written all over the place? no  (and) so, it's just like the common beliefs, attitudes assumptions about um, how we view the power works in our nation? it's a a yeah it's our assumptions about how things work right? (xx)  right but it's like it's a never-changing thing like, always growing, like with the stop example,  mhm right. well there's nothing that says that, we have an American political culture that has the same values beliefs, and assumptions forever and ever and ever right? no. i mean it's still made up of the same, things assumptions beliefs values. it's like based on the   mhm socialization? socialization. can anyone tell us what that means? do i need to? you can take a stab at it. it's like uh, through our daily norms and through our life we're told we have to do something this way and therefore we become accustomed to it,  no it doesn't  stop means slow down and red light means go. mhm mhm so so where's this socialization come from? society society socialization from society that, isn't that kinda like answering the  we learn from what's like around us (xx) who's around us?     schools religion school your peers school your school. media   political events definitely (media) media. okay so tell me how th- some of those things work. they usually tell you, well they usually brainwash you and tell you to vote their, yeah they they told you to vote? well, i mean over time they're like, yeah i'll uh, okay they're conservative so, they're like, they just kinda, say stuff like liberals don't really know what they're talking about and that kinda stuff. okay so  no i heard someone say definitely. i just remember, uh my dad, had to secretly vote for Dukakis cuz my mom would get really upset. so they tell you, so that's that's a pretty uh, (harassment) politically? or, what do you mean? other ideas that you think might, fall into this, political culture thing they might have like a, a bumper sticker, you know they don't say anything but you can te- you like see it everyday, that's true it's true, you may never have a meaningful conversation with your parents, it's c- they, well they'd pretty much um, like they give you your morals, for  how is that? because, there's it like maybe they're really into the environment or whatever.   right that's that's yeah yeah (it's) morally  um, another thing is like y- you listen, to like you just hear your parents talking like, to other people and mhm   well um, yesterday in the D- i think it was yesterday in the Diag you had, those people walking around with the big um, big signs with poles attached, to their   that was pretty political right? yeah and it just it shows you how, like what we we would think that that's, totally wrong but the kids don't know any better the kids know but what are those children learning about politics, from that experience?   but what else are they learning? he told me i was going to hell, a little five-year-old.  i don't know like he was like you're going to hell cuz i wouldn't take his  they're learning to become active (xx)  they're learning that being active and participating is important, right? their parents are showing them that they're, did anyone stop and think why aren't these children in school? i just said that yeah what's that? i just said that yeah? yeah  they're probably homeschooled, cuz that's what i thought too cuz who needs to go to school when you have Jesus on your side. exactly   just the little kid not the big one. (the bigger kid) what do you think that they're learning? not good things. what do you think they're learning about people that are not like them? that if, they're not like them they're wrong. and, what? and  how do you think that they transfer that into political, meaning? that (only people)    what do you think um, they would think about, government resources going to, um activities they feel are,  yeah school and what you should do about people who are not like you. school school? how's that? teaching you diversity and like opening w- what school should do is like, open your mind to like, different cultures different types of living so you can be more accepting.   alright so we talked about um, we talked once about, who thought they really went to a desegregated school, and how many people thought they did? (nobody) mine really mighta been. really? rel- i swear, it was like forty-five percent um, Asian you know (and that) maybe like, black wasn't that represented there was still like maybe ten percent. mhm mhm mhm what about, your peers? do you think (they would've mhm alright. cuz i mean when, you know you're not you learn they're just like you everybody's just like you. there's really no difference. now if you didn't have that experience of uh, being personally exposed to people who were not like you where would you get your information? media media? yeah ooh, tell me. yeah because i went to a school that was certainly diverse i- it was like thirty percent white thirty percent black, twenty percent Mexican, ten percent Asian and, ten whoa,    yes, it's important okay,   because that's how they think about it if they're, they see people that aren't like them that didn't go to school, like with you know, if they didn't go to the best school or whatever that they uh, they they're not like (they're) different they're inferior. what about their information about, what's the cause of that? the cause? yeah, so what about, oh so they said oh you can't learn people are shooting each other. right i guess because they weren't white i i mean, it's that's that's, that's kinda that's what we always, thought it is. cuz of their own political cultures. Brit? um, because if they, feel that people aren't learning there or it's violent or whatever (just) shut 'em down. i don't want funding going there well i'm not going to support this candidate or i'm not going to support this, group. so it shapes what they,  well when um, when you go to school in a, a place that's very diverse and it's forced to be that way, mhm uhuh uhuh   uh well it didn't work at my school.  because you're gonna associate with the group of people that, you're used to so is it really you're still segregated and you're, and like technically cuz your just (xx) Paul? it didn't work because, perhaps other certain elements (form this association.)   that's what (i think) Katy? just that you have, all of these beliefs in your head that you got from your families before you even went to school so, it all comes into play. everything, is built on the others, mhm mhm  uhh... they're just not like them. they think that, does that  yeah like what? um, in terms of, i guess, abortion. abortion? yeah okay, so what do they think about that? they think that they're, very very scared if the new, uh Supreme Court Justices that might be appointed are, of Bush's choice that that is a big threat to, to Roe-v-Wade? it scares them. what else? yes yeah and so what do you do with that new information? John? well um a lot of people only know about, uh other cultures on a superficial level, mhm do we tend to have real nice things to say about people who are different than us? no i don't think we can make a broad-based generalization like that. you don't think so? i don't think so.   okay so maybe we  so we could get ahold of some of those and find out about it maybe but i, mhm okay, who had who, a lot of oh, well i think um, generally, the way that we're seen, is maybe really um, conceited we think that like, our government and the way we run our nation is the best. and, therefore we try and impose it on other nations, mhm mhm ethnocentric. it's when you think, you you you can't get out of the little circle in which your own culture is contained. anyone else, wanna respond? Paul? i think that, America's as a whole is terribly ethnocentric i mean every time we get into a war, we go in there and we say, we're gonna kick Saddam's butt and let's go in there and kick the commies' butt because they're wrong and, democracy and America's, the greatest thing in the world so let's tell the Chinese they all need to change their laws and, to some extent i mean we, America's presence in the world is seen as the finger pointer and, at times we become the policeman and, i think that, we harp on differences, more than any other country but at the same time, it's the fact that we do that that makes us, increasingly, um, progressive i guess. okay, other, responses? Mark? well in in addition to that i mean, it kind of makes our country look, insecure like we're scared that, for instance like the communists are gonna take over, and so we have like, we feel we have to stop it or something. mhm i don't know. i don't know what that's doing anything for (xx) (or concern) we we fear what we don't know? we don't know a whole_ i mean, okay so there were the, communists here and s- you you saw the, you went to lecture? you saw the little political ads? you saw the Johnson ad where the you had the little girl and the suggestion that  a little very little just that it was bad just that it was bad? yeah. that it was different from us? yeah. Katy? um, i was just gonna say um that people do, fear what they don't understand and our lack of knowledge and resources of all of these, different cultures different you know styles of doing things lead us to believe that ours is the right way and the best way to do something so we_ people are definitely, ethnocentric. okay. Michelle? and it's within like our own country as well   Stacey? i think it's kind of like, two different things though like, what she was saying about like, the country and like not being able to generalize it like, and what he was saying about like the way we are with other countries like, i feel like the way we are internally is different than the way we, i do feel i- do you know what i mean?  mhm John? um, i think it was on Leno or uh, Conan O'Brien, last week,     go ahead. they were uh,  uhuh    yeah, well you know but yeah the fact, that's not my point. the fact was that he said uh, mhm, so what does that, what does that story tell us, about politics? that the guy who we might elect as president, doesn't have, the knowledge of, what_ was uh, socialized wrong. how 'bout the role of groups in politics? (and organizations?) we have people, in our_ to get together with us who have the same beliefs as us and the same, you know values and want the same thing in order, to get that done cuz if you have a group of people who, have competing interests you're never gonna get anything done you're gonna be, (xx) so there's there's uh, there's two ways to do that right? you wanna get people together who have a common interest. they can have a common positive interest or a common negative interest right? so we can all want the same good wonderful thing, or we can all want to prevent someone else from having some good wonderful thing right...? does anyone see where i'm going...? no? let's uh... when we talk about racial politics, what's that? racial politics. you hear it in the news all the time, playing racial politics here. supporting people of your race. supporting people of your race? trying to appeal to minority groups. trying to appeal to minority groups, Brit? it's kind of like you, bring in a, Supreme Court Justice, and he's of the minority just so, you get that group, or you know, get the southern, vote or whatever. so we might do something symbolic, yeah pass some type of, or, urge for some type of like civil rights legislation or, something that will help, people of that group, and make them see that you're, an advocate of them. okay, so that's that's how we get minorities on our side what_ are we always helping minorities? no and why is that? help yourself Adam? uh opposing, opposing viewpoints and pressures for um, groups that, that think there's that there're more there're other important issues to deal with. Hannah? you can get more votes with the majority so you don't always go with the minority if, the minority's interests really conflict a lot with the majority's interests cuz you're really, mostly concerned about, keeping your job. okay so let's pull power back into all of this. so we thought about, what do we think about people that we don't necessarily know, a whole lot about, that seem like they're sort of different from us...? (okay beliefs about that,) does that shape our beliefs about, government and, power and, where power belongs and, what power should do? yeah? how's that? Brett? cuz maybe um you wou- you think that the other person that you don't know very much or the other ethnicity that you, don't know very much about lacks like yo- they're inferior to you or whatever that you're, you're superior to them or whatever. so then you don't want someone of tha- of the opposite um ethnicity, having power over you like having uh like your Congress job or, for that district or your governorship or whatever, because you feel that, they don't know how to run things cuz you know how to run things (you were raised) (xx) (Adam?) what about um, what about some other ways that we get some different ideas about, uh politics and, where uh, where power belongs? so what about... is anyone in here from Detroit? anyone from Detroit? what do you mean  Detroit proper. Detroit. Detroit Detroit (xx) Detroit's (xx) no. anyone from, Detroit suburbs...? who lives in Detroit? no one about a million plee- people live in Detroit. there're not (happy  African-Americans Latinos, a lotta Hispanic people. i was in Detroit last night, sorry. b- before the riots, (xx) (have) riots in the, thirties and forties and then in the sixties right? who lived in Detroit? everyone white   everybody. they had a population at one point of about three million. Detroit was a pretty gosh darned big booming city. they had this whole auto industry thing going for 'em, right? then what happened? suburbs suburban sprawl. but why? because  because they, cuz they, the people that were living there, um, i mean they're, they're minorities that wanted to live there that were living there and so they didn't feel, there was tension, between, minorities and, and whites and that's why, they figured that mi- they'd move to the suburbs so minorities couldn't use_ minorities couldn't afford, a Margaret? (xx) what i hear cuz i've talked to my grandma like, what happened would be one black person would move into the neighborhood, and everyone would run. that's what happened. so there's this movie, called_ and don't_ this isn't what the movie's called. um, there's this called The Color of Courage has anyone ever seen it? it's about Detroit. alright, uh it deals with this, concept. restrictive covenant do we know what that is? yes no? no okay, it was an agreement among neighbors, that you signed, supposedly a legal document, that said i will never sell my house to a black person. okay, supposedly a legally binding contract among neighbors, it was part of how we kept neighborhoods all white. it was a legal contract? supposedly. it gives you power. mhm. it supposedly protects my investment right? yeah yeah devalue it so, a couple things happen, one there's a housing shortage in the African-American community. okay, they've been kept in a small little block this is, especially bad in Chicago but it happens here too, okay, there's nowhere to live. whether i wanna live amongst a bunch of hostile white people or not, some of some of us have no choice. some white people looking for some money, they're willing to sell me a house at a much higher price than my white counterpart would've paid. i'm now into this white neighborhood. then what happens? they all leave they get ostracized they all leave? they think that property values are going down i'm gonna sell out, sell out quick. what else happens in Detroit? riots  overseas they start (leaving) they leave Detroit, are the big factories in Detroit proper, anymore? no are the corporation centers in Detroit proper anymore? no that leaves Detroit with what? slums no, no no tax base right? that money is gone. what would you do if you were living in Detroit? leave get the hell on out, right? wait why is their money gone? no tax base. their entire corporate sector is gone. well why can't the black people that are moving in become the new corporate sector? what do we know about black wealth? it's not strong. there isn't any. people have been keeping us from buying even small houses. since we've been freed from, slavery people have, found ways to keep us from accumulating any wealth in the first place, right? all the wealth moves out. who can't move with it...? poor people which tends to be highly correlated with African-Americans, right? i don't have the resources, to go, move somewhere else, right? charter schools trash you hear that there's trash rodent problems. gambling gambling? (people like to gamble) that's supposed to help them so, who's, who's from a a, Detroit metro suburb? do do they pick up the trash in your neighborhood? (yup) what about schools, do you have  yeah? what about um, snow do they get rid of the snow? yeah? hmm. well that's not a public (xx) that's not a public service they don't p-  (on the streets) yeah, but they clear the streets so you can drive your car on it? (xx) nope probably not? what what do you think the difference is? well the difference is we have a lot more capital to work with. i mean we have, a certain about of money and a certain, amount of people that are, continu- continuing the whole entire flow of, keeping the city well kept, managed organized educated, and funded. so local government's generally a good thing where you live? yes i mean you might think you'd prefer to have a different mayor and you know i don't know maybe they would, put up a different colored suh- street sign or something and, you'd be a little happier, right? but, what do you think people in Detroit feel about, their local government? it sucks i don't think i'd be too happy with it yeah? well the Detroit local governments are just as displeased with their own constituents as the constituents are with their own their uh, government. well don't confuse a Dennis Archer personality conflict with, right? so what am i saying about culture, political culture? (xx) and that,  	1
LEL500SU088.json	okay let's get started... couple of uh, quick announcements. just to repeat uh, the announcement that i made last, day. which concerns a change in the lecture schedule as you see up there. so after the, the exam on Tuesday, that's a reminder that, the next exam is on, this coming Tuesday. uh after that we're going to go on, and uh talk about opiates. so you wanna print out the uh lecture notes for opiates next. then there'll be four four, lectures on opiates followed by two, uh periods of addiction and then we'll finish up with sedative hypnotics. okay? just, make sure you get that down so you have the right lecture notes when you come. the, again the format for the, next exam, on Tuesday will be exactly the same as the format, for the last exam. any questions about the lecture schedule, or the exam? when is the question and answer session? oh right right right. so there will be a question and answer session, Monday, four o'clock, uh on the terrace on the fourth floor of this building. there's a, terrace there. Monday four o'clock, an open question and answer session. anything else? yup. (yeah.) i have a question. okay the effect of tolerance was just, you can act- you can think of both of these, this and this as just being, two ways, where you, form some manipulation that causes receptors, five-H-T-two-A receptors to down-regulate, so you have fewer of them, or you have more of them. okay so with tolerance, if you give L-S-D repeatedly, what happens, is if you go in and look and measure just assay with a binding assay the number of five-H-T-two receptors, in animals that have been made tolerant, given repeated injection of L-S-D, you get, down-regulation you get fewer five-H-T-two-A receptors. and, you get behavioral tolerance. that is, the behavioral syndrome that you get in the animal, is decreased. so if receptors go down, behavior goes down. and then there's the loose connection to humans cuz you know with humans, n- when you you you get good tolerance as well. with the other one with the denervation supersensitivity you do the lesions, receptor populations go up, and behavioral potency goes up, they show, greater potency. so as, you man- as you manipulate the receptor population up or down, the behavior follows. i have a question  yeah. i actually haven't given you this hypothesis yet. i'm just giving you the data so far. but i'll, i'll state it very clearly in a couple slides. but, yeah. that's gonna be the difference. the previous one was that it was acting, the previous, hypothesis was it was acting at this receptor, the presynaptic, mechanism. and i'm obviously leading up to it's acting at these guys. and that_ not only that but, these guys, are, five-H-T-two-A receptors specifically. and th- this kind of data suggests that. so if you do this kind of a correlation with other types of serotonin receptors, it doesn't work, o- out as well. and i'll give you another, another piece of evidence i mean, i told you there are fourteen different kinds of serotonin receptors so you should be asking, how do you know it's the five-H-T-two-A one, specifically? cuz there's lots of other serotonin receptors we've, found postsynaptically. and i haven't actually given you good evidence for that yet but that's coming. yeah? um, you said that the, effect of the antagonist was to, decrease the effects of L-S-D, yeah no it doesn't have any effect on the cell firing. so, if you give a five-H-T-two receptor antagonist, you have an electrode in an animal, cuz you can record serotonin cell firing, okay? uh, and you give L-S-D, cell firing goes down, and the animal show these hallucinatory behavior. now you can experiment where you, in your experimental group, you give 'em the five-H-T-two receptor antagonist, and do the same experiment, now give 'em L-S-D what happens? cell firing still goes down, that's not changed, but they don't hallucinate, they don't show this hallucinatory behavior anymore. it's another dissociation between cell firing. presumably, this is not, t- five-H-T-two-A antagonist, is antagonizing the action of serotonin, justify these two A receptors there's fourteen other ones there. presumably, this is not a five-H-T-two-A receptor. but, some other one is. and it's, probably postsynaptic. cuz with this there are presynaptic receptors. um, if like someone reported to an emergency room, with a, bad acid trip would they give him a, a compound to pull him out of it? no. they they, couldn't do anything, you know could- in that setting could they try? put him in a safe place, talk to him nicely and, could that be a setting where they could try the, serotonin antagonist? well these are not yet, the- these compounds have, lots of other effects, they're not the kind of things that, that you would do, to antagonize uh, a bad trip. okay, exam on Tuesday, don't forget. 	1
DEF270SF061.json	any questions any of you want to get out right now before it, it's official? (xx) to that? yes, we we  that's one strategy yeah. well yeah, that's true. it's called a defense strategy. hm i should have brought the plane that runs down. have it, try to take off in that direction. take a bullet  i'd say the key to a good defense is a good offense. mm, that's basically what this is for is humor so i can_ it really serves no research purpose.  wow but we got good   this is the what? what is this? oh this is our trainer airplane. last Thursday it uh, had an incident with a tree. so it's broken?  oh yeah, this is broken this is not the research airplane    yes there should be an extra stack sitting over there somewhere. mkay here it is. yeah i think so, yeah. so if you wanna fill that out um, the tradition is that before we get started, everybody else leaves and the committee meets oh it's on tape. yes, i'll be talking to you later. oh kind of in two parts the first part which is the major part of the research is talking about the generation and execution of, real-time plans, and then we talk about an application which i have a particular interest in, namely autonomous flight... so, the overall research problem that i have been studying is, how do you get safe autonomous operation when you really are looking at a real, system, um which re- well for for the main that requires real-time response. um, in particular when your system has, limitations such as computational resource limits which often people don't really pay attention to even though they're always there, and, when you have a complex hard real-time system where you require safety guarantees, um those two things don't always go together naturally because, w- when you have a hard real-time system you really, have to, talk about deadlines and meeting those deadlines, because if you don't meet them then you might compromise safety of your system. so uh, at this point i'll briefly mention the show-and-tell, device that i've brought here. which uh, i'm going to be talking about airplane flight and um, i'm going to claim that airplane flight is inherently dangerous. so, this is an example of an airplane flight gone wrong, which basically um, we lost communication with this airplane last Thursday when we were flying it manually so, our flight was neither safe nor autonomous, and basically what happened was, um it was equivalent to having, a very long delay without doing anything, in which case the plane had plenty of time to fly into a tree, so, if you think at the extreme limit of where you have a resource-limited system, and, you end up in some processing loop or you're doing something and not paying attention to say where your airplane is flying, this kind of thing could happen. so, anyway i won't talk about the airplane anymore don't, let it be too much of a distraction. so the final, um aspect of our problem that complicates is is that whenever you describe a problem that's, fairly complex you don't always get everything right. so, in some cases you have imprecise knowledge in other cases you may have incomplete knowledge. or both put together. so in the worst case, you have to make trade-offs. the three specific uh, types of trade-offs that we focussed on, are first of all if you have a real-time reaction set which would ideally keep you safe all the time, and it doesn't fit on the resources that you have, you have to do something you can't just say oh well we'll assume that it fits. so we study that trade-off. um basically, in order to make that trade-off sometimes you have to relax your safety guarantees from absolute, to some other, um method of guaranteeing the system. um a natural, way to look at it is to, maximize the probability that you're going to succeed. so that's what we look at is to decra- degrade, safety guarantees to probabilistic when necessary, and then, since we degraded those guarantees and since we, allow incomplete knowledge, we have to recognize and react when we, reach unhandled states. basically unhandled states are those that, have been ignored due to incomplete knowledge or, probabilistic guarantees... so, two aspects of our approach first the, an overall view of how we look at plan generation and real-time execution, is that we separate the planning process from the plan-execution process. and in doing so it allows us to use, a lot of the powerful but computationally intensive, planning algorithms, to develop the plans, and then also schedule them, so that, we know they will fit onto our limited resources when they execute. we began this work, by, considering a system that was designed specifically to do that, namely the Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture, called CIRCA, which has, a planner and a scheduler and, to develop the plans and then uses, um what it calls a real-time subsystem basically, a special module that has carefully designed um, knowledge of its resources and how, uh worst-case properties of, the various items that might be in the plan to execute those plans. do the um, tests overlap between different, um TAPs? uh no, the planner is set up so you can only choose one action for each state. so wait assume these tests are things like sensing.  okay so y- so any kind of overlap is handled by that process  right no. that, this is, so basically part one is done by the planner. and the planner also comes up with the deadlines. and then part two, the development of this TAP schedule on a timeline for, the guaranteed TAPs is done by, the scheduler. and it doesn't know anything about tests versus actions it just knows, the worst-case execution times, W-C-E-T there for each TAP which is what it assumes when it builds the schedule, but then as you see there there is this average-case execution time so, any time one of the TAPs takes less than its worst-case execution time, you can reclaim that time for all of the best-effort TAPs, plus any time that remains, once everything is scheduled. so is this a a partition of the sensors basically? no it doesn't pa- no you might use the sensors, um, in any of these tests so, say you had a feature, altitude for example, you might use it, in every test that you have. let me take all the sensors and put them together, let's call that the sensorium okay? okay. is, are, do these does the un- do the union of all these tests, if you if you look at the on of all of them mhm if your plan does not require, knowledge of a certain sensor value then, you'll never care about it in this plan. is that what you're asking? i'm asking i guess, you've rejected, you've referred to this paper in the, in your thesis that uhuh oh yes   i was confused i thought you didn't deal with states i thought you dealt in se- in outputs and in perception in per- and in perceptions and then you imputed, families of states to those perceptions  are we, are we equating states and sensor outputs so that, there's  not at all so, the plan execution idea you don't have, there's no_ states aren't there.  okay. but, su- suppose TAP-one involves checking the altitude and TAP-two involves checking the altitude,  yeah, mhm  not as part of the architecture but, for the architecture we have, for our U-A-V, um, we separate the low-level-controlled state estimation processes from the stuff that CIRCA does, so that it actually_ the feature tests are virtually instantaneous because, the state estimator already goes out and reads all of the features and stores them in memory, at a- which time any of these tasks have access to that memory. so for that specific case, feature tests mean reading something from memory. this is not generally the case because in previous versions of CIRCA there have been, robots that really haven't had any underlying, control mechanisms where feature tests meant actively going out and looking at something in the world. so, as far as the architecture is concerned all it knows is there're some functions do feature tests. and they don't take time? i mean hm? they don't take any time? (to do the) no, well, in the U-A-V they take a very small amount of time but we still have to account for the amount of time it takes to read something from memory. um for, the, general case they could take time and, the the times that we use to schedule these TAPs, include the worst-case execution times for both the feature tests and the actions... does this uh the attack classification, stay, static or change, depending on, where your control system is in? for any particular plan it stays static. why should it be though, if you're talking about aircraft landing problem or,   yes   mhm but it seems to me, the uh, altitude-sensing and elevator-control TAP, mhm well i would have a tough time seeing that elevator-control could be best-effort but, um, so pretend that you don't care about altitude when you're at high altitude although actually i would care about that too because otherwise you could end up in this dive or, severe climb, so i would s- i would argue and say that they we- they were all supposed to be guaranteed. for example you can miss deadlines for several periods   okay. so anyway the CIRCA-two is what we use to generate those control plans and then to execute them. the, it's divided into two parts the planning subsystem and the plan-execution subsystem. the planning subsystem is in blue because, it's executed in soft or best-effort mode, meaning that, it takes as long as it needs to to come up with an accurate plan, that's scheduled, and the plan-execution subsystem is, the the part that, we require hard real-time response for. i'm first gonna go into the, planning subsystem algorithm, very briefly, so, when we start up the system, it first, reads in the user knowledge base which contains the state transitions the initial states goal states and so forth, and at that point, um we have a very simple algorithm right now that just, goes down through a list of subgoals and plans for them in order. so we select the first subgoal. at that point we run the planner, which basically starts with the initial state and um, develops the, the set of TAPs that it needs, um to avoid failure and achieve the goal, and it develops the deadlines for the guaranteed TAPs, which are then turned into a schedule by the scheduler. if the scheduler succeeds that plan is downloaded and everything's happy and we're all done. otherwise if the scheduler is unable to schedule all the TAPs onto the timeline that it has, it generates feedback for the planner, which then has to, make trade-offs to, alter the plan so that it can be scheduled.  hm? search for what? best-first search. what are you searching for? we're searching for all of the ways to avoid failure primarily, um in all of the states that are reachable from the initial state and then also, um at least one way to get to our goal state.    all of the paths to? to failure. well, that's what we're, when we relax our probab- guarantees from absolute to probabilistic what we say is that, we can truncate the search, and everything after we truncate the search, has some nonzero probability but, we didn't have time to think about them. okay so it's best-first search but instead of stopping, y- y- you're y- you're, proceeding until you hit some,  th- see that's not why i'm, i'm not sure i'm not sure, there's a probability, of_ involved with how, uh much of a plan you've been able to find,  are you talking for the for the real-time plan or are you talking about  well, so we're prioritizing the probability of ever visiting a state. so that we end up, cons- expanding first the states that we expect to visit with the highest    so sure to be plan time   no i, yeah. that's, right now you would not come up with a different plan, because, the motivation for best-first search, right now, is, not really, as as strong as it will be when we try to restrict planning time. so right now if you, had the search ordered totally differently, and as you got to states that were unlikely just threw them out instead of searching, uh i- instead of expanding them you'd come up with the same plan. so the motivation for best-first search is really for in the future, to, be able to think about having real-time planning bounds. uh actually Mark has a valid point though. what what you're doing is attaching probabilities to states, yes mhm well, we haven't even really def- defined what the right plan is. so, i uh just to_ so, the reason you have to prioritize at all,     okay so, is, probability prioritization necessarily the right thing? uh, for that,    the, where this would be a wrong kind of way? yeah, yeah well, i mean one one of the things that i claim CIRCA is not useful for, is in a domain where achieving goals is just as useful as avoiding failure. so,   mhm right. mhm  so did you, pa- try to work up, a representation of the p- i mean, seems to me that there's a fun- there's a more fundamental problem, mhm right  right.  what does the unconditional, mean, in the,   right. okay as a r- is it also conditional on, uh, no action? uh, yes so if you put an action in then that also alters it its probability. in fact we rely on that because, like this crash, um transition will have some, function that shows that it's going to happen if you don't do anything. but beyon- you have to change that by having an action in, that says well actually, i'm gonna get out of that state, S-two and before a crash will happen so that effectively, causes the crash's conditional probability to be zero, at all time. so that's what we're trying to do with those. okay so this is confusing so, what does it mean to have a probability of, the action, i mean after all, you're contr- the action is what you're controlling.         yeah right.   right. so the actual choice the planner's making is, should i put this on the, schedule mkay. yeah. should i put it in, and,    okay. so why... in a situation where tests are free, mhm i- would you, instead of searching through all the states? yeah. well, the tests are almost free. but even searching through memory if you think of the exponential, worst-case set of states that you're gonna end up with they're not free anymore. so when i said they were free i meant they were free relative to going out into the world and looking at each sensor value each time you look at a feature value. so we're not willing to go back to the representation where you have, just the complete list of states because even in our simple little problems we have, uh potent- we have hundreds of states that we would have to look at. certainly in more, complicated problems we would have thousands or, more states. so but tho- a thou- a thousand, thousands of well s- it could be, i i hesitate to put a number on it because i mean this is an example that a grad student sitting, in front of a computer trying to do too many things comes up with for a model     yes  okay   yeah   yeah.   okay that's in this,  so in this model you've basically got the, probability distribution, over the possible next states, uh and their ti- and the time of the transition, yes yes right okay and the probability that we're computing is very dependent on, for the guaranteed actions what we set that deadline to because that affects, where that, max-delta on that rate curve is going to end up being, so. the- um, if i i didn't understand but i i when i pretended that i understood  yes right. yes  it may not pick up any of them, i understand   yeah. right. mhm right mhm yes. yes,  yes and n- so it's a it's a heuristic way of, approximating both the state history effects uhuh  right. right. yeah.  you're colle- you're aggregating states, essentially. yeah, mhm  okay you're aggregating transitions from and to     yes. i, referenced a couple of papers but then i didn't go into details of what they're doing. w- wh- why were you convinced that that was the wrong way to go? well, for several reasons one because they talk about aggregating, states in terms of, abstraction and feature extraction things like that but they they don't really consider plan execution and making that real-time at all. so they don't they don't produce step, part two of the plan, they don't think about deadlines, so in order to think about deadlines you first have to guess at which deadlines you needed, and then you'd have to consider those as separate actions. for your transition matrix. well, i i actually i don't understand that answer cuz, this particular question, this is a subproblem you've got it has nothing to do with the actions, right, it's just, what question is that? the question of what is the, uh relative probability of achieving these certain states conditional on some particular plan. well uh it's,  mhm    oh okay. mhm mhm i, would need to see the black box to be able to answer that, um i have looked at this mostly from the Markov process literature in terms of, using it for planning, not in terms of using it for, a particular domain as a black box. so, i- thi- the the stuff that i've read about Markov decision processes and, using them for planning, made it clear that you had to think about, the deadlines separately in order to generate this type of real-time plan and that it would be a problem if you didn't know what those were in advance. not to mention the fact that if you have to think in terms of state history then you have to add a lot of extra features in order to, uniquely specify the conditional probabilities. so, if there's some way that they get around all of this and still end up with real-time control plans then i'd certainly like to, be pointed to that. well, i don't think anyone would suggest that they solve your whole problem for you, right right. right. yeah, no, n- i feel like this is not done i mean if, you can ask my advisors that every other week i come into a meeting and say well, we can do this with a Markov decision process and the fact is we had to choose one particular route for this, work and i don't feel like it's done yet so i personally plan to continue to look, at   right. the, but one of the reasons that we made this decision was because, we were not, out to get the optimal plan we were out to get something that, was sufficient for our_ the guarantees that we wanted that was able to reach the goals.   your decision about what, which way to go. i mean if you're not going to take a fundamental view wouldn't your decision vary from application domain to  i have a question of a quite different sort, uh yes right mhm    there's a particular issue here too cuz you're, i thi- weather is something that you would get, you get, uh execution-time information. mhm plan time? what do y- what do you mean by plan-time? in other words you have these models that use, mhm    at planning time, yes. at planning time. uhuh  right.   right. so so right now what we would assume is that we would take a current forecast before you would ever take off and use all of the the transitions associated with that to develop your plans, and then during flight, um, this is something for future work, if any of those meteorol- meteorological events change substantially enough, that it invalidates your plan then that's when this real-time planning would be very important. to bring back in. but since we didn't do the real-time planning we also didn't focus on, what happens if these change during dynamic, execution. because we weren't ready to approach the real-time planning problem either. but there are a lot of interesting issues, uh that relate to what, for example flight-management systems, mostly now they just store data yes right  mhm  that's because they don't think about right yes right, mhm. right. so so, i think to summarize and then move on because i'm not going to finish otherwise, um, the, regardless of what planning model we have, i mean this is our current model, we haven't discarded Markov decision processes as a possibility i think that was obvious from the pages and pages i had at least talking about it in the thesis, and, we think this sort of representation is appropriate because, the alternative is that you somehow have to, relate all of the different events that could happen to you, in order to build up, the conditional, probability representation before you ever start. so, this is our current model and, i'm certainly open to suggestions on what,  of train data? of terrain terrain. maps of the   whereas you're dealing with a highly dynamic, you know unpredictable environment. right. i, can you define what you mean by in the middle? what  well, right now, what hel- the events would have to be modelled as state features which is not unreasonable to think of, so to handle it with our current architecture we could model, uh one of these events occurring as a state feature and have that, be something we would react to dynamically. so that's kind of the next, part that i'm gonna get to here. so, i was gonna go through an example that talked about the computations of these probabilities, um, basically, in this simple example, i start out, um, having two temporal transitions, the blue lines talk about their probabilities, um unconditional, and the red lines talk about the conditional probabilities when you consider the probability of both of them occurring, um in the same state. at that point, um, we can calculate the cumulative probabilities which is that summed, from the time step zero to see what happens, um over time until they converge, basically until the sum of them approaches one or else, there is no probability that anything'll happen later, um which gives us these cumulative probabilities of sixty-five percent and thirty-five percent. and, um that also for this very simple example since it's a tree structure, gives us the state probabilities for S-one and S-two... so at that point since it's a best-first search we would go to S-one and try to expand it but in this, extremely simple example we'll pretend there's no transitions out of S-one. in which case then we expand to S-two. so, in S-two there's a probability of failure, so, we have to select an action which is the climb action, that preempts this failure and then we have to calculate the deadline, or max-delta to avoid that failure. initially we set that to infinity because we don't know what it's supposed to be, in which case we determine that it w- it will fail. so, then we identified, what the minimum delay is, for, T-T-F-zero, um which is five as you can see from the, um probability rate function, at which case we can calculate, um that the max-delta or deadline for the action has to be five also. that gives us these state probabilities for the entire state-space. um one interesting, the table on the center shows well what if you couldn't meet that deadline at five? um what if you, fail during scheduling then, um at that point you would have to relax that deadline perhaps, or get a new action. this shows how, computing these state probabilities would, allow you to at least get a sense of what your probability of failure is so, at this point if you chose a deadline of six you would have a one percent chance of failing from that state, and if you chose a deadline of ten you'd have an eighteen-point-seven percent chance of failure. o- one more thing c- can't you handle more TAPs by using uh CIRCA-two architecture as opposed to original CIRCA? more TAPs? yeah more TAPs. well, if you relax their deadlines substantially you could. um it's hard to predict for any particular domain whether you'll end up with more TAPs with longer deadlines, or whether you'll end up with the same number of TAPs that just have, smaller worst-case execution times. well you do have,  right.   right. right. right. we we certainly have that but, i, it's, that gets kind of fuzzy because now at least the people at Honeywell claim they have this reliable notion of a temporal   well so part of the future work that we want to do um i i did some separate work on quality-of-service negotiation, that hasn't really been put into CIRCA but the idea with that is that you would, degrade the sched- the the the the plan not only with the planner but also with the scheduler. um that hasn't been connected because we haven't drawn the line at, when do you let the scheduler trade things off versus when do you make the planner trade things off? when the planner alone is trading things off it really doesn't have any, mechanism to automatically say i want to make this a soft real-time task. um, however, in future work we hope to allow the scheduler to look at how it can degrade task execution to help it schedule things. okay. let's see um in your domain, i'm wondering how you actually get down that curve, um you've uh, you stated very clearly in your thesis that, safety above all, mkay right.  so you, one of your states is i'm on the ground, mhm.    right.  no no no but there's also this, this class of people that go around saying, safety is, of  i'll i'll give you an yeah. yeah. yeah. right. okay.  yeah. so so anyway i'm getting worried about finishing here so, real-time deadlines are requiring that i move on. so um, the second part, of the three parts that were the main part of CIRCA architecture, is talking about unhandled states. what happens when you ignore things or when you have an incorrect model, um well first of all as we said in no_ in great detail, you may not be able to schedule everything in one plan. in which case, um you have to be able to detect and react to important unplanned-for states as they occur. so, what we basically did was to look at all the state classes that you could have and uh selected subclasses of those that we thought were important to detect, and then, implemented algorithms to do that. so... this is this picture of world state subclasses that's been floating around for a while um at the very outside we think all the world states that could possibly occur but then we acknowledge that we might not have, the model for everything, so the modelled set is within that, that all-world state set. um if something happens that's outside our modelled set since we can't even represent it we can't hope to do anything about that. within the modelled set we have those states which we've called the reachable states, um that we've planned for um there are some of them that can reach our goal states and some of them that can't. but anything that's planned for we've thought about avoiding failure so that's all um, that's all been taken care of. the other two sets which are the focus of, really the focus for, thinking about real-time catastrophic failure avoidance, are removed states. those are the unlikely states that we've talked about, where if you have some unlikely transition then you're gonna end up in the state that's not very likely in which case, that plus all the downstream states are not, a- are basically thrown out, of consideration because we're ignoring unlikely states. however since those are something that could occur we find them, certainly important to detect and react to. the last type the imminent failure states are those that, um we acknowledge that our model, may not be completely precise, so, basically, uh... if there is a transition that has not been put into your model and you get to one of these states, then it's very important to detect because otherwise you'll fail. i- is there any, um sort of best-effort, uh in the schedule? i mean, a- a- the scheduler uses the worst-case, yes mhm   mhm.       when you decide not to, do all your tasks,  no no right but  right. right.   right. right. so, right now th- th- the way that we do that is to say, we're going to split the actions into two plans so that we have a contingency plan and a nominal plan, and then all we have to do is schedule this, TAP that will detect this unhandled state and will go off and pull, this other plan and that specifically, is responsible for reacting to that unhandled state. so it's it's, that's that's all we do now in in future work we might   cuz those are the detection and response are guaranteed TAPs? right. mhm. well, we looked at it i i don't think it, this will work? what's that? no we looked at it the the testing for TAPs right. well, so so one of the things that i was hoping with the quality-of-service negotiation in the future, is uh to actually, provide mechanisms in the plan execution system that it will truncate execution of a TAP if you don't finish so if you degrade its quality of service, that might simply correspond to relaxing its worst-case execution time, to something that is closer to the average execution time which would allow you to schedule it and it would allow you to do it most of the time but then if you ran out of time then you would truncate its execution. then you would have a somewhat of a imprecise computation model   uh basically by looking at the state diagram and looking at the probability that it'll enter, into one of these states that has, one of the threats that you wouldn't respond to... so, this is again, thi- this is not an approximation it's a s- this is the, this is a fact  so actually, why do you even think of it as a plan cache i mean it's really just, uh the overall plan has   right but that, that switch is actually, specified in the plan actually,  mhm. however you could use, the same contingency plans for multiple, nominal plans. which would mean that you would be effectively having one overall plan for your whole system if you wanted to think of it that way. i mean a- at this point when we get into terminology which would be saying that like, P-R-S has one plan for the entire system, or, WRAPS has one plan or, however you want to think of it. e- effectively yes, if you think of the whole system as using one plan then that's absolutely correct. but, in our terminology we think of whenever we switch schedules, that we're switching to a new plan. and it's not just schedules we're switching, a set of actions that get done also. any  just a, personal question, yes, yes.  ah, okay okay, okay. that's a good answer. so we, we've talked about it a lot, and uh, they're gonna of course keep the airplane here because our expert pilot is here but, since my role is in large part doing software, and we are close to having MATLAB simulations of what we believe are the dynamics for the airplanes we can do a lot of the, uh software testing remotely. and then if there are major flights i hope to come back and, go out to the field and test it. did, did any of your implementations work? um,  well how would i know, ho-  well no,   right. right well, that's something that i've been struggling with for a while and, the problem is, what do i plot what do i what do i, what do i show because, it doesn't really tell anything to show_ so you saw in the Q-S negotiation section i had controller response which made sense for that because we were varying worst-case execution times, for things like the controller and seeing what happened eventually became unstable. for, thinking about, whether CIRCA succeeds or fails, uh, these are such high-level responses that, plotting the trajectory of the aircraft really doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. and, since these are, high-level discrete values, the most i have been able to do is to come up with, here's the plan and, i could give a video on     you had three different scenarios i think    so, wha- what would it, suppo- you know suppose you're running the F-A-A, in ten, twenty years let's suppose you know, well they don't like,  what are you gonna say to, people, are you gonna, you know next year you're gonna be writing, grant proposals. mhm. so, there are two, separate, ways that i am looking at this i mean one, avenue of me getting more plucks is to put this in with say the simple longitudinal controller, for, not only model identification but overall, what happens when you, uh detect this problem and do some, so so...  right. s- so so far i've been, doing this kind of high-level comparison of CIRCA to CIRCA-two and, in the future i hope to_ the reason i keep talking about these Markov decision process models is that at least for that part i want to compare,  mhm.  mhm.   well, i hesitate to draw these trade-off curves for a tiny scenario because i think that what we would end up with is two data points and we wouldn't be able to say anything about what they would look at_ look look like in a more general case because we're not, our goal is not to prove one, particular example works it's to show that the system somehow improves on previous results so, i have purposely hesitated to come up with a simple example and say look here is how it degrades because... the curve would basically have a very limited step-function appearance and would not be representative. l- let me add i mean the curves you have there of, mhm. yeah, resource capacity. uh yeah resource capacity. i mean, presumably if you actually had this implemented in some system for example the U-A-V, yeah. mhm. yeah. right. mhm. right. right. yes,  but i think, you know you've got that overall curve but that's actually a composition of two separate things which themselves might be, analyzable, mhm.  right. mhm.  okay so that's one piece   okay... uh i'm not quite sure how to get that second part the first part i i can get for specific examples but again i'm not sure how that generalizes and see but the second part it doesn't matter actually what the states are you know it's it's really, mhm. it matters,    so i would take the results you know suppose you had a hundred actions they were all coin flips, right,  okay but   you know nothing right now really about the performance of your, unless you're here you are, w- uh, um working on these very very, yes. mhm. mhm. so i mean we wanted_ showing that it works well under favorable, assumptions all across the board, mhm.   mhm.   that you got the right, that you that you got the right, levers here, you know?  okay. mhm. oh sure. no i agree. yes, mhm. so, i, thought i presented what the system wants to do, no i don't think  okay.   but we didn't see, we, you didn't you didn't have, y- you didn't parametrize those, stresses, you came up with one stress or another stress and what you, would want, i think what you would want to do mhm.      mhm. mhm.  the planner. yeah yeah  or or in situations where the, time rou- if you, revise the time cost, of processes, mhm. mhm.     uh so so so so, but but, but so so in some sense to average all that out, to do some     i mean one of the challenges with me somehow running, uh a whole group of simulations, on, the aircraft simulator that i have is... uh quite frankly we haven't even been able to accurately characterize worst-case execution times because the simulators run on UNIX. and they have since i've had them, and so if someone else logs in then, the models suddenly become totally inaccurate. and,  right.     right. right. right.   right so the, f- the idea with the the n- the next generation of CIRCA student that's working here in the lab is that he's comparing, our current stochastic model with, um, uh the, stochastic simulations that he's running based on the actual probabilities and that should be able to yield some comparative results of what, you would actually see, versus what our model's predicting and he's, beginning to characterize that error but then, that's not my work. and, hopefully i can reference that work in the future, um, b- but i don't necessarily see myself repeating that work because he's using exactly the same model. um, i do see myself, i mean i hope before i wo- leave here, to have, CIRCA running on this airplane. which, would give me a specific set of limited computational resources to work with, and a specific set of software to work with it on, but, i didn't see myself spending the next two years waiting for all those processes to be available, so that's why, i want to leave now, right. i've got to leave shortly so okay, we've got all the important, at least questions asked? correct? (xx) so if any of you want to talk to me, later, i'll certainly be around... okay thanks a lot thank you and i'm afraid we have to, (xx) (xx) 	1
LES605SU080.json	okay. did you say anything about the paper? yeah i did. are you gonna repeat that? can i ask you after class today? let's, there are several of you who missed the comments on the paper. who who missed the comments on the paper? i did. so why don't we huddle in the corridor after class please because there's another class that'll come in and i don't wanna repeat the whole thing in front of class. so we can have a consultation after class. okay? alright. um, couple announcements but maybe you wanna start first and then i'll go into some things and then we'll go into Sarah's presentation. now one announcement, Diane i won't use her last name. why? oh thank you, Diane. um, any questions on that? it takes, oh i don't know an hour and forty-five minutes if you look at the whole thing. so it's time well spent. any questions, or comments some of you missed last time some of you were busy dancing, or dancing_ what was the dancing for, Rina? it was, um, a fund-raiser for the children's hospital and Beaumont Hospital oh i see yeah  and Mott's and Mott. okay. did you raise lots of money? yeah, we did. and you danced nonstop, more or less. yeah, more or less. wow (xx) okay, so now you're rested. um, maybe you can get notes from someone. any um, questions, or comments regarding last, time's um, session? one more point i wanted to make about the daughters of Zeloph- Zelophehad. and i, alluded to it, maybe i didn't stress it enough we have here a legal case, Kim you'll wanna know look look back on it and if any of you wanna meet with me sometime talk about some of this it's fine. um, what is so interesting about that story these five daughters, is not only that they present the case which we already talked about they present the legal case, to the heads, of the, heads of the state. i mean these are, this is a little bit intimidating. but, they present it themselves. with all the legal arguments, they present it themselves. they don't get themselves a spokesman. they don't get themselves some man, to speak for them because they're only women okay, not only do they present the case legally, uh in in the in the correct legal language and legal arguments and all of that, but they present it themselves. you're talking about a patriarchal society, but they're not, intimidated by that, they hold their own, they present their case well, they are mentioned in Joshua that it's rehearsed in Numbers uh so you know they really make a point for themselves. now how many of us, present our own legal case in court? not many. and so if we're intimidated by this in our modern age, uh i think it speaks very well for women, being heard, being acknowledged, being given recognition. they won their own legal case it's taken to the deity. Moses takes it to God, which is only proper in his role as prophet, he is the mouthpiece of God, God gives the judgment, but they give them, a serious hearing. and, so that's one of the points i don't know if i, honed in on it enough because we sort of ran out of time, but it's very interesting in terms of setting precedent, in terms of setting uh jurisprudence and so on. uh, have any of you had experience with the law? with legal things? how did that go? good good. i've had experience with the law too. i built this little old cottage up north. in, what, after i got the foundation i had all the permits. i got the foundation then, i got a stop order. all the constructions on the harbor it's on Presgill Harbor got stop orders. one November. nine constructions. and mine among them. they all went with a legal case with a legal firm. i said no way am i going with a legal firm i'm not building this house on spec. it's mine. the logs are on site, i've already paid for the roof, i'll do the legal work myself. and i did. and it took me months. but, i got the permit. i had to fight the D-N-R, the Fish Game and Wildlife Commission, the um, Army Corps U-S Army Corps of Engineers, they know me. RESTRICTED there's a question. RESTRICTED okay. i've never read the Song of Songs so could you just give like a general RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED is that why they think it's in here? RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it's just like Moses's mother. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED come sit down. i didn't want to interrupt. RESTRICTED um, in chapter one, it talks_ it has the um, first person plural. in verse, four.  RESTRICTED right. the tradition- interpretation of this that i'm familiar with is that there's the bride and the groom and there's these group of friends, or who are kind of narrators. uh, and they kind of, pitch in from time to time. uh, so i was yeah other women and that's that's the refrain, yeah yeah RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED i think i think it probably could be a mix of both like, i think both interpretations are valuable i think like, the feminist interpretation is in_ is really valuable on a personal level. i think, and especially to women in sexuality and even to men in sexuality, and i think that the Rabbinic, um, thing is also really um, a good interpretation for religious purposes and for like faith purposes and it it could be a really beautiful poem. um, to express like um a relationship with God and the people too. i think that both interpretations are, good ones. i've also heard an interpretation that um, the Song of Songs was, like, about God's gift of like love and sexuality and marriage to, to people. like like a gift for us. and that it was written in there like, because nowhere else does it say it. um, i don't know cuz... all the all the, mainly poetic books are pretty much lumped together. and like a lot of 'em, are about like, all kinds of random things but this one's like all about, like love marriage, and this, this whole theme and i- and i i don't know one interpretation is just that, it was in there to show that, it was a gift for us or something. i don't i don't have references for that though. RESTRICTED um, it's interesting that you talked about you know the Bible's view of sex and i don't think the who- the entire Bible is anti-sex i mean RESTRICTED y- your statement was a little i think overgeneral i thought. i mean, you can find other references, especially in the New Testament, i think that, that uh, indicate that it's a gift and RESTRICTED i think it's uh, a wonderful statement of sexuality. the way it starts, the Song of Songs. that's um, already hyperbole that's the highest song. it's and it's a poem and it's a song. it's the highest song. that's what it means. Song of Songs. and then it starts into a celebration of love. the imagery is, of of fruit of figs of wine, of of of of pomegranates of mandrakes, it's all a cel- a celebration of love and sexuality. in a in a very positive way and and upholds that and i think you're absolutely right um, and it's uninhibited and that's the beauty of it. a celebration of uninhibited eroticism. and that's what makes it so unusual in the Bible. and they did include it in the canon. and that's interesting too. but you start out with sexual imagery. i was gonna say too that, i mean even if it is looked at, as um, even if it's taken as an interpretation of God's relationship with Israel, the fact that they use such um, sexual um, images and and ideas, says something for the sexual experience. mhm and the description of the anatomy it's all there. none of it's couched. i mean, they talk about all of the you know all of the female body. the breasts everything, on down. um, in in a language of celebration. it's really quite remarkable. so yeah. RESTRICTED if you look at chapter two verse sixteen (and) seventeen. RESTRICTED did you say that this, like from your research like, it was credited to Solomon? because like, when he wrote a lot of this stuff it was, after, like his, like he had turned away from God and come back, and it seems like... i don't know i just had this funny thought that, like, like if he had that kind of experience, like, if it was a man writing this it would be more likely to be about, like the actual, like less than metaphorical sense. you know like he was using all these metaphors to describe, like sexual relations but, it's probably less likely that, it was like, him thinking about this is God's union with Israel. you know what i mean? it's not attributed to Solomon. uh it's linked to Solomon somehow because Solomon had, he built the temple. he was, he had wisdom. somehow it it it comes at that point in Israel where they're at the height, their golden age. and so the song is linked to him in that way. but they don't attribute authorship_ well they argue about it but i don't think RESTRICTED it could've been someone in his court though that he hired, or  nine hundred horses. she sits under like a tree. she sits under a tree what kind of a tree? palm tree. a palm tree, called... Deborah Kenite. he's Jael's husband. he's Jael's husband. so here we're introduced to Jael's husband. and the reason for this introduction here is, that um, that um, Sisera thinks that the Kenite is going to be loyal to him. um, and so, that's um they they had separated themselves and they were sort of off in their own tents so they're itinerant they're they're wanderers and they're living in tents. and then we get back to the main action. um don't they run into each other? yeah in Ben-Hur they do they have this race. um i thought they sort of, uh, they'll run up, and fire their arrows you know sort of, and then, turn around and run back or so it's not the best way of fighting. the um, the the Greeks then under Alexander the Great developed the stirrups well actually they were developed a little sooner but then you had a horseman on a horse, with stirrups and s- then he could fire the arms without having another man guide the horses. see in the chariot you've got someone guiding the chariots and then these other guys, in the chariot firing away but it's a very cumbersome way of fighting. so anyways, uh, the storm came the sleet and hail in their faces, um, handicapping the men and and and the chariots, and the slingers and archers were disabled by the beating rain and the swordsmen were crippled by the biting cold. i'm sure they weren't wearing stuff i mean or else what were they wearing? cloaks? and that hampers your arms. um, Deborah and Barak had the storm behind them. and they saw, uh, that the storm was lashing the enemy and they pushed on. and of course this is Yahweh the storm God. this is divine providence this is the Deity looking after them, i'm sure giving them courage. um, as is_ as Deborah had prophesied. and then with all this rain and sleet, uh, the flood waters went down the Kishon River and what happened to the chariots? they sank in the mud. whereas these foot soldiers who didn't have much of anything except their hand arms, slew the enemy. they were not hampered by weight they were not hampered by iron, they weren't hampered by um, s- uh, shields and and arms, that that are heavy, so then you go on with the story, uh, the la- Lord routed Sisera. that's really what this is all about. and Josephus see uh, augments the story.  just relaxing him to get him... comfortable warm and, sleepy. yeah he's cold he's been out in the sleet in the ice he's soaked to the skin. she's covering him with a rug, he's he's he needs to get warm and he said to her give me a little water so he asks for water to drink. what does she give him? to_ milk  to put him to sleep better. yeah.    she's strong. she's strong. she's determined. she gets only one chance. right? if she blows it, she's had it. and don't think a man's skull isn't very tough. um, so especially that guy's mhm  he's occupied at the moment. i will show you  mhm. yeah. it's cool. so take another look at the song of Deborah yeah, on Valentine's Day. pardon me? on Valentine's Day i'm talking about rape. ah yes. i hadn't made that connection. (it's true.) happy Valentine's Day everybody. so i will show you some slides because we have some great slides. not so many. but they're really very fine. so, you know we talk about women, in the prophetic tradition. and it's there. lights what, what happened? no ideas. the light's not working is that what's wrong? the light's not coming on. the bulb is probably out. yeah... okay i'll have to bring 'em again next time. and complain to them. see. did you try did you try turning it off and on again? pardon me? did you try turning it off and on again maybe? no bulb. thank you have a nice weekend yes uh that's why i brought it. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED oh that's where it is great. RESTRICTED oh that's the compendium. okay. RESTRICTED fine. alright. good. you did well. mhm? i'm leading a group presentation today and i was looking for some background sources (xx) i was gonna go to the grad library but i couldn't (xx) all the books were (xx) so if you have any other ideas, of sources (xx) anything (xx) um, it's a- no, you have to put some things together but you might want to look at the video. right. that's (xx) the video talks about it some. and it's interesting um, in terms of the Old Testament attitudes and the New. i mean it just talks about sexuality in general but it comes out in that. okay okay. um, um, i seem to have do you suppose it's the bulb? i thi- it must be. i, i can't, there's no separate switch to turn the bulb on or anything. 'm'm.  um, i seem to have uh lost my syllabus and i wonder if i could pick up oh. i have i have more. okay, thank you. oh i'm glad. perfect. thank you. mhm. did you, you lost your whole notebook? yeah. i can't seem to find it anywhere. mm i don't know. 	1
COL999MG053.json	my name's Tom Lehker and i'm a staff member at the Career Planning and Placement office. uh this is a program we hav- as far as i know we have never done before, um we're co-sponsoring it with Rackham, um uh the idea of sort of what it means to be a faculty member as a panel really came from students at some of the other events that we had, um as we would collect our student evaluations which i'll have you fill out at the end of this program. one of the events that students talked about having was something that really, gave faculty a chance to talk about. issues of of faculty culture or faculty roles, um expectations of junior faculty and how those expectations might, um change as a faculty member, uh progresses through a career, um, maybe some of the myths, um myths and or realities that graduate students had, i'm hearing from a lot of graduate students they just didn't hear much from, uh their advisors and other faculty members about what it really did mean to be a faculty member. so we uh decided to do this type of panel to start to address some of those kind of issues. partly knowing that many of these issues are very specific to the individual student or also possibly very discipline-specific. so i think that's one of the limitations that we acknowledge going into something like this, is that we're hoping that the panelists um can speak sort of as generally as possible but also knowing that they will always speak, from the framework of their own, um process that they went through. um, let me just say a couple things sort of administratively before we get started, and one is to say up front that we were supposed to have three panelists today. but i got a call from Professor Rose from the history department literally about an hour ago, she could hardly speak, and said she was too ill to attend. uh but we're left uh with two uh very fine panelists, we'll have um, Farnam Ja- Jahanian, um from the EECS department up in engineering, and also Professor Dickerso- um, Glenda Dickerson, who's also, in the theater department and also an associate dean here at Rackham. and is making her stage entrance (it's very nice) on cue. we're just getting started. good. um, and so the idea of this panel will be that um um, both of the panelists will speak for some amount of time, ten fifteen minutes uh potentially longer if you like given that we're we're short one panelist today, um i gave them some questions that they might want to think about along the lines as i was outlining earlier but then also hoping that question and answer which i always think is is always very helpful in this type of setting. um and so in just a minute i will turn it over to them, i am gonna pass out a couple things, the first is, program evaluation if you could take just a couple of minutes at the end of the program and fill that out. um again it's the evaluations in past years that have led to events like this so we really do take, your feedback seriously. the other, is just a clipboard, if you could also, sign in. uh, we like to, keep a record of who attends these programs it helps us to, justify our, existence, uh for things like this. so i think that was all, i wanted to say i think maybe if the panelists wanna come up now we haven't talked about an order for who would like to go first so you can, flip a coin or could i ask a question before we get started? sure. i was just wondering if you could raise your hands if you're, here because you're not sure if you wanna be a faculty member that you might be interested in a nonacademic career... okay, thank you. so, would you like to start, Mrs Dickerson? well i could i  okay (xx) graduate students (xx) uh again my name is Glenda, um Dickerson, and i wanted to ask how many of you if any of you are artists? wha- what department are you in? i'm in English. and what kind of art do you practice? direct plays and write poetry. fabulous. okay so is i- what's your name? Andrew. Andrew. is Andrew the only one then? if we like to dance does that count? yes that counts okay and what about_ is there anyone else here who's in English? who writes, or directs or, paints or... so what are you all thinkers? economics mhm, and you?  mechanical. and you? chemistry chemistry and you on the floor? pharmaceutics uhuh and you in the blue shirt and the glasses? (public accounting) uhuh and, you? chemistry okay. um, one more. b- all the way back there the back in the beige, cable-knit sweater. i'm in material science and engineering in materials okay so, my discipline is theater as you may have heard. i write plays i direct plays i um, make, i make plays i make projects i make big community projects out of, nondramatic sources and i make them into dramatic events. so you would say well, our interests, couldn't be farther apart. political thinker writer, um, commentator can you tell me something that he wrote? um, Giovanni's Room, um  (xx) um Amiri Baraka, formerly known as LeRoi Jones was another um, black writer a poet um, poet essayist, thinker yeah he was a and a revolutionary thinker yeah yeah yeah noninteractive teaching huh? noninteractive teaching.  Dunry Dunry? mhm so it's easy for me to say well Dunry what do you think about what i just said? but i don't care what she thinks. um i'd like to to start with a question to um Professor Dickerson. um, i know that you, taught at Spelman before coming to University of Michigan i was wondering if you could, comment on the differences of teaching, ah right, well. um... i started out at Howard University, which is a small African-A_ well it's not so small it's a it's a university but it's small compared to here it's an African-American institution that was kinda my first job, and then i spent the rest of my career at I- at the State University of New York, which is a large institution at the State University of New Jersey which is a large institution, and i went from those places, to Spelman College. which is a small African-American women's college in Atlanta Georgia. uh the president was Jeanette Cole who some of you may even have have seen or know of you know they call her America's Sister President she was a remarkable woman. and she took Spelman from this little colored girls college you know missionary college, to this major institution that was known all over the world and it was just, remarkable how in ten years she transformed the face of that institution but, it was so small... a- and there were no graduate, ps- you know classes there were no graduate students and so, the difference is that when you're talking about interdisciplinarity at Spelman, you're talking about about two people. yes some questions for you i have sure sorry i don't remember your name Farnam Farnam? yes number one, can you talk more about what your evenings are like? sure number two, and weekends mm oh yeah. i i can i can whip 'em out believe it or not. no actually it takes longer than that. uh, i- i- i- it often, i was hoping it wouldn't  mhm  my, uh it's called geoscience and remote sensing it's a combination of, the electrical mm mhm so it has to do i- with uh applying the information gathered by satellites that are orbiting the earth, mhm mhm  for example i mean i i need to write a a a paper for an upcoming conference mhm sure   ohh mhm   excuse me well i think too that there's also another way to think about structuring a day and a week. a day doesn't have to be divided up into hours and and and two-hour slots and i think, are other people interested in this question or or sh- yeah often though when i'm m- i had a lot m- n- numerous hours on my schedule that said meeting with research students, what i found out is that unless we're working on a paper for example. often an hour is a reasonable amount of time, to to give feedback and essentially find out what's going on and work through some of the details. um, one of the things that we attempt to do in my group is essentially to avoid having, long-drawn meetings mhm mhm mhm did you have your hand up? yeah, i'm in environmental education and i wanna teach, worse than anything in the world and maybe it's just a perception problem on my part but i, have a real hard time kinda with, with that kind of a snapshot of a day. i'd really like to have my days pretty much the other way around that, like all the time that you get to spend mentoring i wouldn't mind being in the classroom, or maybe, mentoring small projects or whatever even for undergrads. but the research meetings, and th- the amount that if you are going to actually get tenured and actually mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm yeah that's right that's right. well you know one of the things that i wanted to say in my remarks and i didn't say is you know one the most important pieces of advice i could give you as a, young, faculty, m- uh, per- perspective faculty member is, to try to attach yourself to an institution that has a mentoring, system in place. and that, that will, that the department even, a- a- formally, pairs you, with a senior, faculty member who will mentor you. through some of those very tricky questions because, i think, you know this is this is one of the more supportive envir- um institutions that i've worked in you know i've worked in a lot of institutions where you're really just thrown out there you just really on your own. and that's when junior faculty member are really at risk, you know they can't win for losing. just as you're saying, you know you've got to, yeah you've gotta get your research done, you've gotta keep publishing you know, you have to s- sublimate sometimes your real interest which is to extend what you are doing out into the community. so i would say two things to you i would say one is the match, you know, find the right institution, for you. but, once you find that institution that you like, you must have a senior, faculty member to mentor you because there is a way to balance all those things and there is a way, to have value placed on some of these nontraditional things, not even really nontraditional but what, you know that you value there's a way to have them weighted and and valued and so you know_ because you can imagine with me coming through i didn't have a Phd you know i didn't publish you know, my, creative work was my research. but i was in a state university and they didn't know what that meant. i was way back there when we had to fight, not to have to publish. in order to get tenure you know, so, i know what that battle looks like, and i know that there's been a lot of progress made, and i i just think, you can have, the academic life that you want. i know that you can. it's finding, the right match. uh i don't know if you're, tenured or are you? yes, oh yeah okay, i i'm not sure when you when you were up for tenure maybe uh the transition was easier for you cuz you worked in  sure, a a, so uh what did my schedule look like when i was, before tenure? um mhm mhm mhm mhm  but could we keep uh keep the dialogue going? we have another question sure sure i have a it's uh, shifting to a different topic actually. please mhm  um, i'm in the Department of Health Management Policy in the School of Public Health. and why is it that you don't have the opportunity to teach? they don't, um, they don't have T-A positions for, most it's a master_ it's a professional school most of the courses are taught, by the professors and, graded and evaluated, students are graded and evaluated by the professors, rather than by T-As. mhm mhm try Psychology, they're always looking for T-As (xx) do you have any, thoughts on that? it was naive go ahead  i've also, just (i could say) i worked with students who have also taught (xx) courses at four-year colleges. i worked with a student who taught a summer course at at Kalamazoo College for example so i think community college is one that wouldn't have to be limited to that either i think mhm mhm yeah uh (in) my case i i don't wanna have a tenure-track position or something. i want to stay here, after i get my PhD degree, for like two years or something just to have the experience and then go back to my country which  mhm  i'm in, computer information system in the business school. okay C-I-S C-I-S mhm mhm in a in generally, you know gen- generally speaking? yeah um, i wanna look at the first part of your question, you said that your preference would be to stay here at the university for another couple of years,   oh stay in this country yes yeah yeah yeah mhm uh you're on your own Glenda i just heard about it today, that's why it's fresh on my mind, because i have to sit on a, a committee i found out to evaluate, um applications for the distinguished fellow. distinguished dissertation but this is a College of Fell- it's like a post-doc and and and and p- and uh students come from all over, and there're twelve of them i think each, i think she said there were twelve of them, each year. they're twelve continuing ones so i guess there're more all the time. cuz they can come, every year. but you know i mean that's right here you might look into that that's a Rackham_ has something to do with Rac- i think it's_ i'm pretty sure it's called, the College of Fellows you can speak with Glenda Haskell... yeah? i was wondering if you could talk about, a little bit about, the sort of politics of teaching and, uh how you have to, balance between, personal issues. agendas uh, kind of departmental, issues um especially when developing course content or, mhm yes yes yeah it's really it's a it's a real, challenge. and th- the first challenge is that you know teaching is so hard this is what i really, you know so many graduate students are just kind of thrown out there and you know put on tenure-track lines or whatever and expected to be teachers. you know where do you learn that? you know you learn through observation and if you don't observe a good teacher then you ain't_ there's no reason that you're going to be a good teacher. so that's the first challenge you're trying to find your way you're trying to find your style you're trying to, you know get your courage up and not be intimidated you know by these thirty open faces looking you know looking to you to know everything. um, so, you have to balance you know like like all of that stuff so i think um, i think... in terms of the politics of the situation, here's one good thing about the academy. even though we tell all of these horrible, you know these horror stories about you know the poor untenured faculty you know the junior faculty and they're so at risk, you know which is true of course. but you know the other side of that is that you really are someplace, where it is really hard for you to lose your job for holding an unpopular, opinion. you know it's not like the corporate world in that sense you know they really do take, the f- you know your first amendment rights seriously so that you know if you are um, if you are, if you are prepared if you can, you know support what you are doing in the classroom and if you believe in the style which you have, uh built up, you know for yourself, then i don't think that you have to you know_ but now here's what they do in one department i know which i won't mention any names, but there's a real split between, th- the practical, faculty and the, scholars. there's a real split. that's fine you know they don't agree on anything. you know that's you know that's okay but what happens is that there's all this bitching and backbiting and nastiness that goes on in the classroom where these people b- use their students as pawns to get their point of vie- you know that was just, so bad what that person did and which i think is just reprehensible and that's i mean a- a- and you know you're gonna find that i don't know what you can do about that all i can say is that you have to just navigate your way through like you are walking through a landmine u- u-well i think um, going back to what i said about intellectual freedom that's absolutely true. i think in companies if if you have an unpopular position they probably promote you to get you out of that department. mhm mhm yes yes that's right mhm mhm mhm mhm right mhm mhm mhm mhm  hm and you don't have to go to a research institution either. not at on- one of my students is actually, is just doing what you're interested in doing bear with me for a minute i'll share you with you a story. sh- she came to me and said you know, i love doing research but i don't wanna do_ spend hundred percent of my time essentially worrying about research which at most research universities, overwhelming majority of our time is spent worrying about research. and mentoring graduate students she said that's not what i wanna do i wanna go to a place and i wanna do teaching. and what we did was we sat down and we went through a list of, and the job market for computer scientists is pretty good so we went through a list of you know, probably a hundred universities that had, positions open. and i just essentially helped her eliminate, majority of universities that i thought had the culture that did not suit her interest. mhm mhm mhm yes one or two for more questions? yes uh this is really an extension of the last comment but i was wondering if you could, uh speak a little more to the pitfalls that, await junior faculty, members and mistakes that junior faculty members, tend to make especially coming from a large research institution like this one and maybe only having been in that environment and moving to a different, kind of institution say a smaller, mhm mhm mhm you know what the biggest mistake i think junior faculty make is not understanding the climate of the department that they are entering. because junior faculty are always piled up with a lot of work they're always spinning their wheels and always overworked and, and under-rested, but you might be putting your energy to the wrong thing and not even know it. and so i think the, most important thing, the biggest pitfall i think to avoid, is, not to be spending, you know expending all of your energy working for the department because that's all of_ always you know you get all the, you know the, committee assignments that nobody else wants you know and you you know you're directing two plays in your first semester you know in in my world and uh, you know you have, you know you're asked to take on the overload would you mind you know teaching four classes and you say oh yes yes yes yes yes yes trying to be, you know accommodating you know, and then you find out when you get your first three-year, evaluation, if you're, in the tenure stream if you're on your way to tenure then you get, then you find out that, this isn't weighted you know as much as you thought it was and this doesn't count at all and this is really not valued what he really should have been doing, is this this and this and this. and so i would say, really get a clear understanding get it in writing if you can from your chair when you begin a tenure-track position as to really what the department's expectations of you are in your first year. and get a clear understanding that, at your three-year review if there is such a thing if there isn't such a thing, can i in fact have an informal three-year review. where we sit down together, and we look back over the three years and you tell me what my strengths are, from the department's point of view, and what my weaknesses are what you'd like to see me strengthen what you'd like to see me improve in my next three years. then you have some protection, if you're denied tenure. you have some protection by_ because you have this document that says these were the things that i was told to work on and i did and this is how you document, you kno- i i published five articles. i have my book coming out, i you know sat on three you know, scholarly journals or you know o- or you know whatever. so tha- i that's what i would think. that clear understanding of what the expectations are and don't let yourself get overworked, if it's not going to directly, enhance your tenure, um portfolio. if it's something you wanna do, that is not valued, find a way to get it valued. you know find a way to get it and get f- it in writing. i think the biggest pitfall for junior faculty members is that, you have to be careful. you wanna be a good citizen but don't overdo it. mhm mhm mhm mhm  yep how do you say no? oh you just draw the line. and what you do is a good department, when you approach them, we do this in in E-E-C-S. with, first of all junior faculty members the first two years are given no official service req- assignment. mhm mhm mhm  mhm mhm mhm right  swamped  we have a last quick, relatively quick question? yeah? how many people don't get tenure? you know i was very shocked i don't know what your experience with it i was really shocked when i find out how many people go all the way up through those seven years and they do not get tenured. i mean i was really shocked when i began, and you can't see why. you know it's like you just simply cannot please, some institutions you know you can't they've done everything they've published and then, but they're p- you know it's just not seen good enough and it's not prestigious enough and it's just not fit, enough. so i would say i don't know any statistics maybe, maybe some of my colleagues do but i would say a lot. we- is that a third question to ask a search committee? what percent of   (yeah) actually ask ask the uh j- not just the search committee ask various faculty members ask the dean. and here's the reason you should ask it. in fact a lot of universities when you go for an interview, they tell you that wow we are a very tough place   mhm yes mhm mhm   don't  and that's what   yeah yeah  right  that's right  right mhm mhm mm mm mhm mhm mhm mhm that's right it's very important that the institution that you apply to at a_ finally align yourself with is a nurturing, institution. because there are a lot of institutions, who, have the attitude that my colleague says, well we'll hire you, you know and you're out there on your own no guidance and if you can get through us then you deserve tenure and if you can't you know so what. and nobody can, succeed in that situation and nobody should have to and nobody should want to. so the important thing is to ask the right per- i think a great workshop, would be questions, to ask, on your interviews. when you're going to interview for your first tenure-track,  oh there there there're people who've put stuff like this together my students have tracked 'em down. and there's stuff that that're available that, it's maybe particular to engineering (xx) discipline, i'm not sure. but i know uh, my student was telling me because i go over a list of questions that they should be asking us all, and she had a list of like a hundred questions she had come up with, that she found on-line. search for it if you can't find it send me email i- i'll find it for you. actually there was a workshop like that   oh i was wondering about that i do wanna thank the panelists again for coming out thank you all good job if you would take a couple of minutes to fill out those evaluations i would appreciate it you didn't tell us that we were gonna be  	1
LEL105SU113.json	cuz i'm gonna talk about it so we'll quit. you know i'll just stop lecturing here's the midterm, (you messed up one) is anyone missing today out there?  (xx)  that's alright (xx) no   oh you're kidding go go take a nap. i'm gonna go have some hot tea. okay can everybody hear me okay? okay, alright this is the schedule for today, i'm gonna lecture on women work the notes are being passed out now, and, uh i'll, finish up at around ten after eleven, then i will hand out the midterm, and um i will discuss the midterm, for a while a little bit, to make sure that all of you understand, what's expected of you in the midterm okay? i wanna remind you that we do not have class meeting on Thursday, this is to give you a chance to work on the midterm, um if you're writing the midterm in class you'd be writing the midterm in class so, spend some time on thinking about the midterm, it also will give you a chance to, get in touch with me or, um, your G-S-I before the end of the week, so that if you have questions about the midterm, uh you can ask them. now i won't be holding office hours Thursday morning but i will be, uh able to meet with anybody who feels desperate in need to meet with me in the late afternoon on Thursday so if you do, email me okay? and we can, set up some time to meet okay? now uh are there any qu- procedural questions? the midterm is due in class, on, Tuesday, right? (does that make sense?) (xx) right okay and you guys figure_ you'll figure out a, a way to get your_ get the midterm you could put you know the sections, down so that people'll know, how to_ where to place their midterms. okay in class on Tuesday and on Tuesday, we will also be seeing the first half of Salt of the Earth, uh in, the continuation of our unit on work. uh, men's and women's work now are there any questions, before i get started? okay? okay. um, now i just wanna remind you that we've just finished discussing men work and, uh the uh presentation the slide tape presentation, the computerized slide tape tape presentation, uh that you saw, uh did i think a very good job of linking cultural notions of masculinity, to the changing experience of work for men. what i wanna do today, is give you an overview of, women and work, and although i'm less concerned about how their work experience, had an impact on their notions of femininity, what i a- will be emphasizing, is how cultural notions of womanhood, determine, women's work experience okay so it's a little bit different than, uh men's, uh sense of masculinity and how it, was altered, by their experience of work. uh and we're more concerned now with how cultural notions of, femininity proper femininity determined women's work experience. now i wanna make some general mar- remarks first uh some s- s- sort of generalizations the first is that, the tension between women's work and women's role in the family, was, present at the beginning of industrialization. in a way that it had not been, in the colonial period. so that they the we we take for granted today that there's tension, between, women's role in the family and women's work lives. many of us experience it either through our mothers or, in own lives profoundly and if you don't experience it yet, whether you're a man or a woman, you're gonna experience it soon. because it's still there it's there in very difficult ways okay? um and i will be talking a lot about that uh later on. but industrialization, and what it did to the organization of family life, really began that tension in ways that haven't been experienced before because it took, men's work out of the home and out of the family and pulled, some women, increasingly more women, into wage labor as well, raising fears that i just wondered if there was like an increase in possibly older women who couldn't work in the factories did they, go into childcare pr- childcare providing because of this shortage? no there was no coordination of need and knowledge you really do need to do that, you know in a, systematic way and either local government, state government or federal government has to, uh you know g- get in and coordinate that and there were no funds for, thinking creatively about that at all. here. there was in England. for example where they desperately needed workers and women workers filled, that gap. um, okay i because i wanna talk about the exam you guys can pass it out now. i'm gonna stop here and finish up, uh uh the uh end of this uh lecture on women and work, in which i just deal with what happened after World War Two, in the present, uh i will finish that up, just at the beginning of class on Tuesday, uh before we see Rosie the Riveter. but right now i want you to read the exam, each question at least twice. no  the goods produced and who produced them the goods produced and who produced them okay say it a little bit louder. the goods produced and who produced them the goods produced who produces them, was there a lot of technology? was it an agricultural, uh family? was it an industrial family? um you know who made the money how? did the money be made? was there money? because some of these groups there wasn't any money just a little hint, okay? alright so the material conditions of lives are everything did u- that has to do with the day-to-day, living eating, you know dressing yourself producing et cetera et cetera. so the larger economic atmosphere and everything else that goes into that think expansively okay? and i want you other_ immigrants. uh some some groups of immi- immigrants okay immigrants. let's take the first immigrant group we discussed the Irish. okay? we could probably, given what we've read, and what i've talked about in terms of how the Irish were treated, how they fi- one way in which the Irish fought back. one way. they, they played on Sunday. okay they also drank on  sixteen-oh-seven? Native Americans and Puritans (for) the family relationships do you want us to do each one a little bit or pick one or two and get more   you pick the ones that you can compare and contrast best. okay? the ones that you have the most information (on.) is that does that answer your question? okay. um, (xx) (xx) twelve point  double    oh that's fine 	1
SGR195SU127.json	we want one of those.   i don't know but it's big.  it's probably big and expensive. well how are we doing on cost? i remember_ we didn't have a price for, water purification right correct do you have that Zip disk? i do. you do, ya wanna pop it in (at least we'll,) see how we're doing, with cost? (i think) we were up around a quarter million dollars weren't we? yeah   fifty thou. (shucks.) i was just outside talking to like, who was out there, Ehon was out there and that other, how far along   yeah  are they outside? yeah  wow        ouch, this is  i've been telling them i'm like you guys need to (give 'em)    no they're out there doing, Chem three-oh-two. mhm hm  great i'm taking it  that's inorganic right?    Yaghi okay then i'll, Yayee? i had Ras- i had Ras- you had Rasmussen? he was, great oh  mkay  y- i thought so. yeah...? oh Yaghi's tests are bad... what do you want off this disk? it's called, um, it's an Excel oh it's in alphabetical order. usually. (there it is i saw it.) oh brewery cost i just saw it. okay brewery costs.   right    well, i don't know like these are just indexes like a certain percentage that you multiply that by.   no but we can probably take, you know like those average, yeah, they      you do? okay. i wonder how many_ there was only  was it in the economics part? um yeah yeah?   you wanna  mhm  cheaper  food tax. (one hundred and thirteen) that's in the that's from the book yeah. that's from the book... is that just to heat stuff up in? yeah basically i mean i- remember it had to be really really big? because we had to add all the solids?    well what all did it include i mean like,   here i'll look at the book. hmm, ooh, we still need water purification. Brita but we can't even, i mean,  kettle jacket agitator thermometer well, drive and support man hole cover stuff in box, and clamps. install costs includes above installation costs,  i guess to clamp it down? (do we need) cast iron jacketed_is... yeah would we need a, cuz  we just chose the stainless steel? mhm. agitator (xx) wi- oh that makes it    what about,   i have no clue. so that would bring our cost down to only about... well, a quarter, halfway between here and here. well what did we choose at first? what pressure? well we didn't even take pressure into consideration we we- we went up here,  well let's figure out pressure. i, i've been thinking about pressure all week (especially,) thinking that, he's gonna be like, what about pressure?  but i don't think that, it's a big deal cuz if you can, do like these little home breweries in a five gallon bucket and you know,    i don't think so. i don't think so. it's so- it's been,  mhm we also have different temperatures like when you're um, when you're doing the_ well that was for the fermenter, never mind... i don't_ but what about when you're mashing i think you, i think you go like to one temperature and then you raise it up to the next. has to do with the enzymes. i don't know let me get out my  yeah, but when you do w- when you're worrying about, fermentation, you actually go, like you stay at one temperature for a while to activate, one enzyme and then, raise it up to activate another. and then you like_ i don't know leave it in between i think_ w- i don't know i'll have to wait (till) is that, is that the same even for the cold contact method? yeah see i don't even think, we'd hafta worry about it if we do it, that way you know...? cuz what do you hafta wo- why do you hafta worry about enzymes that, you're not even gonna ferment. you're not even gonna make, alcohol. what's fifty times ten-to-the-fourth? ten-to-the-fourth is, fifty thousand. okay fifty thousand why don't you, bump that   fifty thousand no cuz five times  for for a what? no fifty  fifty times ten-to-the-fourth? ten-to-the-fourth is ten thousand though yeah  right it's  engineers in action   and i guess, well, this one we put about, yeah it was about a hundred thousand dollars, and then we scaled it up cuz this was in nineteen ninety, so we scaled it up for ninety, t-  but you did have it at a hundred thousand   oh great. can i see it? is this  yeah so, it would be half that, that would be fifty thousand. fifty thousand sounds more reasonable. yeah yeah if i, i don't think    okay right  Uncle Joe gave us fifty   how big do we  okay. so that's a hundred thousand. it's like halfway between, ten-to-the-fourth and yeah so, about, about fifty thousand? fifty thousand? let's change that. alright. (that'll) save us some money. what what   yup. yay (xx)  word. (stop.) save. just another hundred and thirty thou to go. what else can we knock down? (xx) we   yeah we can spend that much  d- now, do we show that in the final report? it doesn't really ask for that specific, number. maybe if we put that in like, the conclusion just say something like, that's   i don't know i don't think so   okay and so it's okay until the final report? yeah      well the final report takes some, like, codes, (and) environmental impacts, yeah, i forgot about   you haven't been writing down all these websites.   references. hey do you have that, printout of um, that very last site we found, it's like twenty pages,    customized cuz maybe they som- say something about, water. right. that would be the day that i left this notebook at home. alright. i have, (here's the) website. ya know? you think you're doing so well. um, nah i don't have it. okay. try, W W W, oh i mean... no i can't remember if this was it.  brew, brew hyphen, the number four, hyphen sale. brew for sale dot com. (xx) oh? yeah soundin- yes this is it. yeah what type, all this stuff. so i'm  what about the kegging machine do we ne- do we need a  (xx) can we kinda pick whatever we wanna do? yeah. (see if you can find) the water. (xx) most common contain- containers are barrels   eww hey cuz we gotta, cuz we boil it and then we cool it down to go to the fermenter, yeah we haven't,    with the c- you know capping and labeling yeah    oh that's cool  a caustics a caustic storage tank for caustic by-products? where is what's a  um, no before the formen- fermenter, before you mean in the fermenter, you do the cold contact. yeah yeah? yeah. what else have we forgotten? you were reading all that st- caustic storage tank, is that, whatever that is, yeah. yeah where are we gonna store all this filtered junk? all the solids that come out of our beer, is it just gonna run like down the sewer and,  yup we could have a, cuz i don't think  we'll put it down the storm drain. is the fermenter just,  bin. no no, what does i- does it have to be? it's, i think it's like,  co-   yeah i suppose  oh we haven't even   i thought our, i thought the, bottler that we got it said it took care of_ it could do carbonation, and noncarbonated things. it_ that just meant,  yes  uh huh it_ i thought  that would be cool. mhm cuz i thought you had to carbonate, like read it off to me W W W dot M E H, E E N, hyphen M F G, dot com, um slash bottling equipment, all one word, dot H T M L. that's our baby! looks kind of small. uh' uh let's see, doesn't it say carbonated,    i think that we should assume that the bottler does it just assume? and tha- with  yeah i think that's when you seal it i think that's when you put the carbonation    well that's not,   yeah oh, oh you're right you're right. i'm sorry. alright so that's get it right. next time. so let's not worry about this part then. alright. we got carbonation. (alright) go back to that last website. do they give ideas for the price of the fermenters on that one?    uh let's see. uh maybe another good brewing process  um, yes. hmm. oh  why would (xx)  oh yeah   wouldn't that be funny if we put that in our, analysis   (like) fermentation? yeah. that's just the brewing process. they don't, oh they don't have anything else about it? it's just,   oh okay. specialty holiday beers? yeah what's um we should do that wouldn't that be funny? shouldn't we do that? hm  we should huh  i don't think there is a green non alcoholic... we would be the, only ones. which one's  we're on ale. we're on ale now? oh oh? are we on the lagers, or the ales?   we are? okay. are we st- are we still planning on making porter?   okay. (xx) (machine) that's i- like our,   three dollars? there was one in there no i don't think so back um, um a little, day by day this is (cool) but then they, then they said that... yeah. twenty-eight fermentation tanks at, you brew a   that's assum- this one's assuming like you, do it, a batch every day so you put one in, every day, and probably takes twenty-eight days for their,  so, they're figuring ten to twelve thousand dollars each and how big of a batch are they talking about? a thousand liters? i guess, in order to brew every day. alright well can we just st- wait no, you know what though? that's twenty-eight_ if they're brewing every day i bet that's twenty-eight fermentation tanks over like, seven different batches.   right. yeah but they're probably, like letting the, alc- alcohol actually form you know? i mean so they'd be_ their stuff would be longer. that would    would, cost ten thousand bucks?  enough to hold... i wouldn't think about it too hard. we can find another site  ooh. do we need a cold water tank... like to put the purified water in? like what? we don't really need to, store purified water well i guess yeah we do. i don't know unless you're gonna like, turn it on and run it through the filter straight into the, mash tun. i don't know how water filters work.    all i picture for a water filter and this might be way, oversimplifying things  i think i- i think it's safe enough to just do something like that for now. yeah i don't picture like a   right. if between, if if between here and the final report we find something, you know,   alright. well then     yeah it was like    that's cheap there you go.  hm? we need to have (mugs.) (xx) to sit down and (enjoy a cold one.) so, we still need fermenter information and, water purifier,  we're not exchanging any heat though. we're cooling it down but we  true yeah i mean the- we don't have any  we we do (kinda) energy from where? electricity so why don't we buy, cuz if you have, cuz we need to heat up the boiler, the mash tun,    let's assume   yeah that's  yeah it used electricity, it was just like a refrigerator, yeah    a really big cooling tank yeah. it'd but,    that's true we heat up the mash and we cool it down. can we heat it up and cool it down in the same thing? in the same mash tun? um, i don't know. i don't see why not. heat it up all the way but,  yeah we have to filter it after (leaves the) after it,    boiler yeah so let's assume it's like the, like you said like the stuff at the cider mill, yeah,   yeah buy a cooling tank (xx) so, (xx) so, i'm sorry tell me what_ we're gonna buy a cooling tank? yeah yeah to put right before, the fermenter. mhm so don't we have stuff for refrigerated tanks, like in the book and in the coursepack?   just cooling tanks, we just need to know what temperature it needs to be kept at probably. refrigeration... cost of industrial refrigeration i need a coffee. i could go for that. for our material balance, i know we're totally, skipping (xx) do we, just wanna do like, pounds in equals pounds out, around every, process? how we    how do you change like a volume to, a weight?   right but, just like,       like when we have,   yeah you're kidding. yeah  no way of the,   oh our yeast slurry? yeah oh i don't    okay then we're gonna hafta convert it yes... (where we have) yeast final gravity baby. what's final gravity? i don't know. are you sure that's what that means? yeah oh. final gra- i've never heard of that   original gravity. no i'm serious. really? yeah. oh probably because   that's during the boil. specific gravity somewhere  i'm i'm serious.  that's how you, that's one of the ways you determine like how, thick your beer is  original gravity. that's strange. interesting. okay. what are these numbers? color. I-B-U units oh.   bitterness units. probably.      ideal (xx) we're gonna filter it to the,  which then goes to the  i wonder, do you_ you don't still have that book, do you? we can like look up what, i- this gravity stuff is. i doubt that i could find it. that was way too... that book was really really complicated. mm, really  yeah.   oh wow. hops? didn't he say it comes in right before the, in the fermenter? in the fermenter? excuse me. it comes into the fermenter. oh i gotta wake up. it goes on to the fermenter and goes to, the centrifugal filter. the aging tanks right? mhm aging tank, we only have one. and then, the bottler right? (xx) bottler? yes. alright here's my question. i (need um) yes yeah mkay. (xx) so like we're gonna have, alcohol in, this, equals alcohol out here? yup. but i thought our, our yeast slurry was gonna have an alcohol level of like, two percent. yeah well we_ the yeast slurry will have the alcohol content,  which is  yeah oh that's right i- from the recipe. yeah it's like fourteen percent, yeast, eighty-six percent, beer. it's gonna be   it's actually gonna be, we worked we worked   yeah yeah so we've got that  so is this really the cold contact method? it's actually the fake cold contact method. it's from that patent like i don't think, yeah it is it is. okay. this just seems like cheating to me you know? why? like we bought someone else's beer and we're just watering ours down with theirs. we're not watering it down we're just, distributing that alcohol. we're not adding it we're not watering it down. we're getting, you're getting the flavor, from, the yeast slurry,   so we,  yeah... okay.  no. there's nothing under recipes? nope what's that? what's the discussion? it's a, bulletin board. oh  very good. i'm so glad you saw that. what you you, doubted me. i did  well it's over now okay?  think i don't know what i'm talking about. i was like that all along i was like, okay. wow so we have the density of our beer. but it's not specific gravity i mean i i think it's the same thing. yeah i think so to.   in original cuz, it's the recipe, and you are_ it's after you've_ they they're not brewing it yet. we're gonna buy it already brewed, right? wouldn't we wanna,  we want final gravity why why would they   yeah before you, brew it maybe.   well the gravity   higher should be after, the water is right. but that's not the case   yeah  they're kinda different. they're pretty close though and then what does it say down here for, that one's lower  oh, we used the number in the middle. just to be in the middle. what we decided. it's pretty close to water though so i bet it is specific gravity. yeah (wonder) what's yeah what's the difference between these two? if we use, i don't i've i've got i have another page. enter.  i do. can i see them please? maybe. i'll think about it. (xx) brewing preparations (xx) i wish i had a, glossary around here or something. um, you're gonna have a difficult time following my notes here. let's see here.  i'm, (you know,) keeping my mouth shut. okay. we have, per how did we figure out how big the batch was in the first place? we took the number of     point-six-eight liters of alcohol. okay mkay that is eighty-six percent of the total right? i think the beer is eighty-six percent. right. right the volume of the slurry, everything coming in, the beer plus the alcohol. beer   plus the yeast thank you. is, equals what right and we took eighty-six percent of that and got the three-ninety-three-point-six. right yes.  five percent yes.  yes that's right. what are your um, what are your numbers for the pounds of, barley and stuff? quarter of a (mil) for five hundred and twenty gallons, eight eight hundred and fifty-one pounds forty-eight pounds seventy-one pounds five twenty pounds that's right. eight  we have hops. yeah how much hops, this isn't_ this wasn't sc- eight ounces then right? right this was for, it never changed  it didn't change when we  no it doesn't  one ounce per, yeah   what does that mean with the, percent A-A? i don't know. so for five-point-five gallons they added, (xx) point-three,    just scale it. just,  yeah that's what i  i don't know.     make a graph and then   i think linear. cuz that's how you scale most recipes. it's two-sixty-five, fifty-six-point-seven fifty-six-point-seven. read that off again. say what? two hundred sixty-five ounces for the first one. of hops? for the, yeah.  yep. and the other two are, about fifty-seven. ounces? yep. is that in a five hundred twenty gallon batch or a ten-forty? that's for ten-forty. really that's it? oh that's for a ten-forty? yeah... yeah. cool.  which one is that? it's the volume of our yeast slurry coming in. we took this value times  yeah this is linear. cool. sorry go ahead. oh   it's thirty-nine-thirty-six minus the volume of the slurry, gives you the initial, volume of, it gives you   oh okay oh okay. there're sixteen ounces in a pound?   cool. how ya doing...? i'm very tired... i'm gonna hafta run over to Rendezvous and just, chug a cup of coffee real quick. i think we'll probably need to take a, if we don't make a lot of progress take a dinner break. dinner? please it's only three o'clock. i don't know, well i didn't eat lunch so, that was stupid on my part. i ate a big brunch today. we went to the Gandy Dancer for breakfast. ooh very nice. i had a breakfast of pizza at about five thirty  why so ear- oh. i was still up. still up? gotcha. gross. my roommates do that all the time. uck. pizza at five thirty in the morning. yeah they do. four, five thirty in the morning. it sounds good at the time  as soon as you take your first bite you're like why did i just buy this. well no we we scarfed it down in about three minutes. did you  plus accumulation. plus generation generation okay. hey have any o- have you heard   well it usually takes, i don't know like,  we be waiting around for them i got so many people knocking on my door now.  you know?  i'm not gonna wait around for them. oh you wanna hear something horrible Fay got an offer from Abbott again,  no way.      not till     i hope General Mills, gets back to us. yeah. what?  yeah. do you guys send thank you letters? i did for interviews?   i sent a letter. really? it's nice to send a letter but i never  i've never had an address. i didn't, i don't know. i haven't, and like, does it really make a difference or, is it just a courtesy thing? i think it's probably just a courtesy  we're not gonna  that'd be pretty shallow. yeah it would. alright i just don't really see the need. alright so we still need, we still need, sorry water purification and, we still need,   yeah we need a cooling tank.  put some ice cubes in there. we got our, that could screw up our  we'll just like, i don't know, treat the kettle as a big giant, refrigerator. that's right.    ooh how come that's the only one capitalized Tighe? sorry.  (xx) it's in the one that's (xx) yeah (without the) those mm (i don't) mm alright i think we need to come up with something for, the water system.  i got we gotta  really? yeah. in this hold on let's see about... gravity i don't know if this is something to talk about it cuz it's just for, our little home brewery. i think Ann Arbor water is just fine. i don't think it's (gonna fail.) describe ranges for physical attributes like original and final gravity, okay. look at that. but it still doesn't say, I-B-Us are we, going to assume... um that the, specific gravit- our yeast slurry, that we're gonna add, how are we gonna get the specific gravity of that? right, of like,  we know a volume but we need_ our whole mass balance is in pounds. i thought we were going to assume one. oh that's right. we were just gonna assume like a certain, yeah    not a volume balance   oops we did a volume balance i don't think volume is conserved. from, in a fermenter  so we c- okay we'll assume  well... zero-five-one, final zero-one-three. and that's just of the beer. so wouldn't we_ with the yeast in it do you think it would be like more dense? ohh well i think you should just just assume, just assume the yeast without i mean, to be e- just the yeast i mean we've got like, twenty liters of just yeast,     we were talking about this last time like a hundred pound sack, you know like if we came up with some kinda, you know. go to,     how mu- do we know what the weight of our  do we know what our weight of our yeast needs to be? we know what our,  ooh and we don't know a density of yeast so, yeah well, we'd mass the yeast, and then we calculate its volume. should i just assume, an O-G of the entire yeast slurry? to be like one-point, two, ish? well, but then you have, a whole lotta of beer, a whole lotta of yeast.     yeah i would think the it would be  mkay.    hm um, you know what we need we need um, some sort of web page that gives us, all kinds of densities hey i bet we can find it. i doubt it and (that,) i'm like (xx)   yeah in the blue book. yeah you're right. i doubt it'd have yeast though do you think? you never know. (should) we go find somebody outside? yeah i don't (have) my book. where where were um, Ehon and Pratik? they're, over by the windows  i'm just gonna go run and ask 'em. who else was working on three-oh-two? i saw some girls, it's worth a look oh  for help? do you know of anyone taking it next semester? probably a bunch of people. think so...? our class_ i would say a little less than half, is taking it right now so probably the other half will take it, next semester. are you in it right now, Dave? no i, you last year? these homeworks, the G-S-Is write the homeworks and they're just like ridiculous, homeworks they're so hard. huh bad timing? yeah i can't, make it to office hours ever. yeah we had a pr- ours we had a pretty small class, i bet there was only forty people in it or something    hm. yeah i, i (don't know) Rasmussen must have been easy or something cuz, it wasn't too hard for, for us. let's hope you get her. so i don't know what kind of filter we need. filter? yeah. i mean we just oh water? yeah, can we just, have something like that on th- like you said just something on the line going out?    no it's not in there? or no they don't have the book. n- it's not in there. oh. (do you know what) get outta my seat. punk. did we did we search? i just searched, i was gonna look for m- water purifiers, okay hold on let's see if we can find density of, see if we can find density of yeast. say, say stop. (xx) it's, (well here.) (go ahead.)    could be, (think.) um i think it's,   oh use a different search engine. that's annoying. oh (why)   oh. yeast (xx) whoa whoa whoa. (that one) over there. good call. um, that doesn't look like it's gonna have something how about how about (although i see it) (xx) hm (oh that) would be dry yeast too. i don't know. (brewing book) in the sky. i don't know what to say. (i wonder about that) one on brewing that was on the page before. this? yeah. yeast there's a lot of different, types of yeast.  yeah. look at this. that's, dry yeast. it hasn't absorbed any water. well what about the one where she displaced it a known amount of water. three hundred   oh one point,  yeah. okay. that's the density that she gives for (th- our) yeast? yeah. for the dry yeast. i say we use it. one-point-three-three  well it's dry yeast does that   when she, w- what? when when  oh okay. and i- ours is gonna be in  oh alright, yeah.   yeah that's really_  i don't think anyone responded. oh what's that web page? bio net, (i don't know) here i'll find her thing again. um, some big long thing? that's cool hm cool. alright so we got our density of yeast. alright let's work on water. then we just need, one f- (hey) we need a filter, so. fermenter. didn't i g- didn't i have a, price for a fermenter i think i did. i thought we saw, like some place where you could buy one and it was like thirty-five thousand dollars,    okay that's so cheap. yeah yeah.  yup. hm. (xx) Bavarian brew, brewery type of yeast.  duh-oh. (if i could) type. could you type?  hm. but we're after November first so we can't use that. we are after November first? yeah. it's only available before November first. we can't buy 'em right now? no. price probably went up... let's say we got 'em on sale. now but don't you think that's peculiar, that the fermenters, would be the same price as the storage tank? a little bit i mean, maybe they're just selling them at that price, because, it's the same  hmm... hm. do you think they'll have any more, why don't you use, use that six- sixty-nine hundred bucks what if he looks at it, and says_ why would he be that picky? he's an yeah. (we got) everything else is outta the outta the book (it's) just from graphs. this is a lot more detailed than that is. these are used, so they don't  no no brewery equipment. i think they i mean they have like tanks and reactors but... this thing is used in, pharmaceutical industry the food processing industry, for mass consumption application, it's a U-V thing, there's no price.  biological stuff out kill,  but it says it's used in the food processing industry. so you'd probably want it to taste good. i wonder if water purifier isn't what we we're really looking for, cuz that's something else. a water, make it taste de-  well we're looking for like the, the ion exchange kind, of water purifier aren't we? where it takes out the um minerals and, i don't know    bless you. i don't know i have no idea. well, can we do the um, we've got everything for the material balance now right?   what is that?     i guess. how big was it? it was just for an aquarium.    up to three hundred gallons of pure water with a single cartridge. with a single cartridge though four times? four times a batch four times a filling 	1

COL200MX133.json	well as many of you know, i'm Shirley Newmann dean of College of Literature Science and the Arts. and i am very pleased to be able to welcome you here this afternoon, to this lecture inaugurating the Werner E Bachmann Collegiate Professorship of Chemistry. let me tell you a little bit, about the man, for whom this professorship is named. Werner Emmanuel Bachmann was born in Detroit, in nineteen-oh-one. he attended the University of Michigan, where he received a B-S de- B-S degree in Chemical Engineering in nineteen twenty-three, and a P-H-D in nineteen twenty-six, one of the quickest P-H-Ds in the history of the institution obviously, under the direction of Professor Moses Gomberg, another very distinguished member of the faculty of the Department of Chemistry whom the department celebrated with a wonderful symposium uh last summer. uh Professor Bachmann was on the faculty of the Department of Chemistry from nineteen twenty-five and he served there until his early death, in nineteen fifty-one. in nineteen forty-seven Professor Bachmann was named Moses Gomberg University Professor, of Chemistry. Professor Bachmann was an outstanding chemist, and his research program was extensive, and significant. particularly well known is his work with free radicals on molecular rearrangements, his synthesis of the first sex hormone, his study of cancer inducing compounds, his manufacturing process for powerful explosive R-D-X, and his contributions to the chemistry of Penicillin. during his relatively short career, Professor Bachmann received a number of high honors, recognizing his work. he was named to the National Academy of Sciences, was awarded the King's Medal by the British Government, was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the President of the United States, and he was given the Naval Ordinance Award. Professor Bachmann's legacy to the Department of ch- of Chemistry is significant, and lasting. and it is wonderfully appropriate that we have a collegiate chair honoring his contributions. it is a particular pleasure, for me today to introduce our honored speaker, Professor Gary Glick who is Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Biological Chemistry, and who was named to the Werner E Bachmann Collegiate Professorship of Chemistry in nineteen ninety-nine. Gary Glick received a B-A degree from Rutgers University in nineteen eighty-three, and a PhD degree from Columbia in nineteen eighty-eight. he joined the University of Michigan's Department of Chemistry in nineteen ninety, and is now widely regarded as a major figure a leader, in the area of Chemical Biology. Professor Glick has combined research expertise in organic chemistry, and in structural biochemistry, a combination which enables him to solve important problems, in medicine and biological systems. his record reflects accomplishments in two distinct lines of research. first he has developed synthetic, and physical methods to probe critic- critical questions of nucleic acid structure, dynamics, and folding. and second, he has established an understanding, of the molecular basis for the recognition of D-N-A, by pathogenic anti-D-N-A antibodies characteristic of the autoimmune disorder systemic erythematosus. the two lines of research carried out by Doctor Glick are quite independent, and they require different techniques, skills, insights and knowledge (sets.) very few scientists can bring such diverse skills and technology, to bear on scientific issues, and his achievements in this have already been recognized by numerous awards and honors. he received a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, a Junior Faculty Research Award from the American Cancer Society, a National Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Camille Dreyfuss s- Teacher Scholar Award, and an appointment as a Research Follow of the Alfred P Sloan Foundation. he is a co-principal investigator on the N-I-H funded Chemistry Biology Training Grant at the University of Michigan. and he has served as an ad hoc member of the bioganic excuse me Bio-organic Chemistry Study section of the N-I-H. as well as assuming the position of co-editor of Current Protocols, and Nucleic Acid Chemistry. this i have to say, is an outstanding career for somebody ten years out of the end of his post-doctoral fellowship. thank you Dean Newmann uh i just wanna make a few comments uh, two things make a few comments, about Gary and uh present him with a uh a plaque. uh, i wasn't around to know uh, Werner Bachmann but i could imagine, knowing his career and knowing, Gary's career that there must, have been some similarities between the two. i have to imagine that Bachmann, was a very ambitious and dynamic person when he started out, and nothing could stop him in achieving what what his goals were and i think we can all say the same thing about, uh Gary. uh the other thing i wanted to comment on is the, the similarity between the way Bachmann, uh fearlessly choose a wide variety of research problems he, he worked on everything from penicillin as, Dean Newman said to an explosive. uh Gary has similar, uh qualities and uh, approaches however i hope you never work on any explosives, i, i hope it won't be crazy. i'm sure some of you have questions would you address them directly to Professor Glick please. Michael two questions Gary d- d- does the stereochemistry matter at all in that in the compound? maybe three questions_ does it have any sedative properties? and in maybe the best of the three at least the one_ h- how did you get from Ellman's library in this to, yeah so the first question is, stereochemistry doesn't matter. there is some antioselectivity at low concentrations that d- all that tells you is you're looking at two point bonding rather than three point bonding. okay Gary you mentioned at the beginning that the (naphthalene) ring, obviously has a big impact on how the reagent works have you tested other, substitutes instead? so if you put, if you put in a nitrogen (xx) (equivalence) it abolishes nearly all the activity of the compound. uh whereas if you, put on you go from naphthylalanine to phenylalanine you would abolish fifty percent of the com- uh fifty percent of the activity. so one of the things we're gonna work on with Bill, uh is uh a real, thorough exploration uh of the diversity that's (xx) Bob? i- is it a naturally occurring material? no do you make it? yeah, a lot of it. Gary, uh you talked about the uh, comparison of your compound to cisplatin in ovarian cancer and cisplatin has a very, sort of narrow range in terms of stem cell type cancers testicular, ovarian. what is the breadth of this? clearly the mechanisms must be different. so in vitro, or in cell culture, this compound would kill anything. um the question is what is the appropriate model to to judge, the extent of efficacy and really i think those are in animal experiments. we have d- we have, we have been given cells, um, uh so i- in virtually all types of cancers that we've tried we've looked at all the lymphomas uh we haven't gone to too many solid tumors, but we've looked at uh osteoclasts that people have given us and said, nothing kills these cells i mean concentrated hydrochloric acid i mean won't kill the cells. so uh i i think what's happening is that we are engaging in a very unique very, conserved very important, um part of the cell death machinery and that leads to these responses that really is the and the the, the point at where we engage this machine basically circumvents all the normal resistance mechanisms. so i think it has a wide range of applicability, how useful it is really is gonna depend on the selectivity in in various models and i think, the usefulness of this compound_ so there are some reasons, why cancer cells can be viewed sort of as activated lymphocytes there are a lot of similarities and i think that, uh, that is related to why we see efficacy of those models. um, how how well that is is really conserved or or uh, in other models is really gonna be up to experimentation but it's gonna really require animal i think animal experiments i don't think cell culture's gonna be useful. did, did you say that the calcium is coming into the cell from the outside, or is the, mi- coming from mitochondria the  there's a question up there does it bind or block to superoxide dismutase? we have not looked at superoxide dismutase yet, although i don't think it's S-O-D because the level of the ca- of the of the, response that we de- with the the change in the r- uh the, the R-O-S change and the ex- the rate of the R-O-S change and the extent of the R-O-S change is so profound so quick that it is really atypical of what one would expect for background levels of S-O-D. so i don't think that's it but that is that is a formal possibility. it's w- we believe actually based on work i i can't quite go into now, um, that it is probably related to an NADPH oxidase. yes and so you said there was some library where you took this from. um, wh- what's in this library? what this particular library contains one thousand six hundred and fifty-nine benzodiazepines, that differ, by where this nap- naphthylalanine ring is, where the chlorine is and where the hydroxyl group is. so these compounds were, lemme show you i didn't show my, one slide, are there other questions for Professor Glick...? well if not it falls uh to me on your behalf uh to thank uh, Gary Glick for a talk that clearly was full of scientific interest to judge from your questions, asked from a base of expertise somewhat greater than my own and also to uh, thank him for doing such important work uh whether or not we are scientists um, any of us who have had any contact with individuals who have lupus, will understand what an important uh piece of research this is uh to, some of our fellow human beings thank you very much Gary for a splendid lecture. thank you. 	1
SGR565SU144.json	before i even try to, spend  waste my time on it no. do you guys think i should email it to her today or do you think i should, run down to her office and give it to her? i bet you could email it to her email?  i just i can give you guys, you wanna read over my section or, i don't know  and it's definitely a rough draft like, and there're spaces where, we think that like st- other stuff should go or like i just didn't, i didn't know if we were like, like in this part i used me i put me too yeah,  right. yeah, which is fine i mean that's something that we can totally fix  okay, at the very end this, jumps up into here this was mine i don't know if_ um, we had like a really, i got together with Rachel last night at the Fishbowl and um, we, were trying to like write it, and we were trying to go about, starting with, like the l- stuff from lit articles you know from articles and, getting the stereotypes from that but like, it was really hard cuz we, ended up both reading the same article, um, and like i didn't think that the article had a lot of, stereotypes, per say. like it just talked about it, um, e- economic disadvantage in single mothers, um, and like, that's about i- you know like it didn't have, a list of like a whole bunch of different stereotypes. where m- i mean, there're some that we can think of, just from what we know on basic knowledge but not from, our particular article, you know which was kinda hard. so then we just ended up, going through and seeing what we'd found, in the media, kind of and just kind of expand it and give examples, um, and, like she looked up some more articles so hopefully we'll be able to find more stuff. like i don't know it's gonna be hard, or it'll be funny to see how like everyone else wrote theirs compared to everyone else and like, you know cuz it most likely won't fit together, yeah  pick and choose yeah um, so, i don't know you guys can go through that, i'll read this, and see. i mean can you guys ha- like find it difficult to like, start writing it? like to sit down and  mhm um, and then there_ there was times when, some of the stereotypes we, had were like, comparing it to moms, you know which i don't know if that is gonna be like a separate section, or you know how we're gonna, put that all together. so do you wanna move? a- are you okay no, it's getting better as the sun goes up like do you wanna look at my bad intro to my, potential part of the paper? it's really, yeah   i love this song.  (xx) paper it's on, i didn't have any other computer paper yeah i wasn't, i wasn't expecting to have to write the literature review by today i was expecting to do it over the weekend so it um, uh yeah okay yeah stick that in there can       right i think, the length is not even gonna be a problem because like, i wrote three full pages and then just a little tiny bit on the fourth page and that was like, saying the bare minimum you know like i could've said   yeah yeah  also,  or something that we found interesting was like we s- it seemed like um, you know how we talked about how, single fathers, who when the mother dies, or when the mother or like, when they're divorced, we um kinda found out that like, um there's m- more communication or like dads are more involved, with their kids when it's um, single or the moms died, and it's more like tension or whatever in, like divorced families. i don't  like you know how okay, you can only have two situations, a widow, single father  uhuh  yeah right i have some statistics about that in my article too. that would be good. and i don't know if, i mean mo- where mostly your media like, divorce- through divorce it wasn't necessarily like dad's dying?     i was thinking about that when i sat down here i was like maybe we shouldn't sit we should also plan, a time for like, next weekend, to get together just,  yeah well  okay um, okay that's fine. i can do_ i usually work like Tuesday and Wednesday night, but during the day like after one i have, yeah, me too. um i find it really funny that, Rachel's not here. i i just you just saw her last night? yeah we worked on our paper in the  yeah yep, cuz i gave her directions on like, where she could park in the back. do any of us have her phone number? i don't no, i had it written down at home but cuz this is like i recycled it... i almost wonder if_ i don't know. what? did she give any hint that she wouldn't be here? no yeah but people do that sometimes. they'll be like oh yeah, i'm coming, i know about it i know i'm supposed to be there this is dumb though like she m-    did she miss, you know the first two meetings that we had? that... that you guys were ok- i couldn't come to cuz j- it was at ba- like bad times but, did she come to both of those? she was at  okay the second one was at the, UGLI right? was it? well see wai- every s- was that the second one? that was the   okay every single one of us besides_ and then the other one was at the Union? right? oh yeah, in the Union.    missed, three? came late. and it's not like, it's not like she had this done either or anything you know what i mean? right right  i thought we had an overabundance of articles oh God yeah   then why did, she need to look  well, cuz we were try- cuz n- since we had the same one, oh        i have some   um it's hard to do because you've gotta be like, you know a typ- s- from a scene in da da it just     in our conclusion? or i don't know in our c- somewhere i don't know if we should like do that so, like or just like s- scatter them u- within the, within the um, paper. you know if that would be fine like if she'll realize yeah we did some articles and here are_ i mean as long as we like say that we do (put it in,)   yeah  yeah  um, but like and you know like Rach- or she's like well i'll do the intro and conclusion or like i'll take it to Sweetland Writing Center and get it looked over and, you know like, i just  cuz all of us would love to be sleeping right now. i just don't want to, count on her for something, because i mean we only have a week left, and if we count on her for something if she doesn't do it, what are we gonna do? she can and i'll give her a D. yeah yeah i, i'm totally not afraid    i yeah i do, i think it's fine_ i mean, wait what'd you say? i said i  yeah i mean i don't think it's fine that she's saying because i think she's saying that just, to, right   is saying  and like if she's gonna, like put this paper together and write a intro and, conclusion, well she better get it done by the ear- early next week so that way, we can come together and look at that and make sure it's fine, you know? do you guys think_ maybe i'll just discuss what i was thinking about putting in the, and the like_ cuz i watched the movie l- i told you like r- Lorenzo's Oil uhuh uhuh uhuh hi  um, i think it's really interesting to show_ like they paralleled each other exactly with how the mother acted and how the father acted. and then i'll note that's the two different movies? yeah,  so then you like, so it  so you wanna include that? i don't know. cuz like the parents, kinda gave up their lives for a while and researched, their son's disease, and they ended up not necessarily finding a cure, but he was diagnosed when he was like three v- no he was like five or six Lorenzo's  he was t- he was like five or six and they told him he'd die within two years, and at the end of the movie he was fourteen and still, not dead um, did either of the sons die in those movies? in the, in the In the Gloaming? yeah the_ he did. he had AIDS. oh really? yeah. oh yeah that's the one where he's older right? yeah he's,   it was a good movie. um, Glenn Close was his mom. oh i've never heard of that movie. i think i've heard of Lorenzo's Oil but      is it, was it    it's a black screen with some dialogue what's is that Susan Sarandon is that the mom? yeah yeah she's the mom. okay really? she's almost nun-like in it though it's kinda weird. really...? aw, (what a) poor little kid  aw um... i don't know what you guys talked about so far, what are we gonna do with the movies then that you saw? are we gonna compare to, yeah that's what i was gonna... i feel bad that i haven't gotten to get my thoughts out because i've had so many thoughts about it but, sorry i just, i had two really full crazy days, uh   sounding board yeah i think like, a lotta my movies, the families, they weren't dysfunctional but they didn't function well like there was, there's not much like, sup- there was never like support going to and coming from, husband to wife. it was like, the wife was doing everything and the dad was like exercising because he was uncomfortable with the situation so he was like right  right and we can use a s- like say that we used it's a stereotype that, a lotta people think that, you know the traditional    right. which i don't i totally don't mind doing if you guys want me to. um, i would just need, um well first of all we need to talk about what kinda thesis or how we wanna organize the introduction so that it makes sense and, i don't know we could say something like well we expected when we watched the movies to see such and such  mhm um did you have that outline, that i gave you  what'd you think? i thought it was good. yeah ho- honestly? yeah  she had laid it out, she had laid it out to do, the main point and then a sh- s- statement about whether it, makes sense or seemed well done, and then do the finding for the end and i thought it made more sense to do the    yeah i mean yeah, i_ yeah, i think that one was_ i think it was (Off and Married.) but i'm not sure. yeah um, yeah i n- i think that's fine cuz it's like a possible outline it's not like made in st- yeah yeah yeah (okay) do you wanna look at this? magazines? i didn't realize we could (get it off them) how would_ i don't think it matters  Y-M  nothing wrong with Y-M oh no. there is nothing wrong with that. um nothing wrong. it also woulda been really, good to like watch the news, to get stereotypes you know but, oh well. there you could   what? do you have a skirt on? yeah and i didn't feel like i was like, i didn't know if it would be warm enough to wear sandals i think it's  you know what i m-     you know what i  alright. no they'll like_ i don't know. i'm weird with the weather cuz like it's hot out but then   yeah it was like i'll wear a skirt but, i guess i'll wear my boots  it says we need to explain the process of taking notes and coding them. um, (it says_) i didn't, i didn't really code my notes like i just    okay   yeah i did. i'd write on the back of 'em  yeah yeah that's fine. okay. that's fine.  you mean like success? (of the dad?) like if they're seen giving loving support to their kids like, encouragement or kind_ like, okay i think maybe we don't need to focus on it, just cuz we're sorta doing like, the single parents like if more of our paper's geared toward, the parents, but i think that might just be kinda random like in our paper. yeah      i wonder if, um, have you guys ever seen_ Kinko's has those like, books that have like, you know those, like page covers, that, you put like, a report in or something they have like a  okay.   uhuh and so then you just stick you stuff in? stick all of the sections together in there. and, okay i know i've asked this before, we do have to turn in the articles that we used right? yeah, i think so so last night Lorri and i     mhm reference page cuz i'm not sure if these articles might be better suited to the topic now that we're doing stereotypes than, the udder, the other articles i had beforehand    no problem. um, i'm just going through this article here. uh, it's called One Parent Households and Achievement: Economic and Behavioral Explanations of a Small Effect. um and it's talking about, how students from one parent households have significantly lower grades, and test scores. and it also, discusses, how uh, it talks about lower income and like about mother headed households. but like and i'm thinking of uh um, Anywhere but Here, does- isn't she smart?  she goes off to Harvard  yeah.    they do that a lot actually like i can't think of anything specifically right now but, people with like bad home lives or like, are being raised by single parents   90210  oh i don't  yeah that's (righ-) that's a good one too. wasn't she just living with her grandmother  the districts that's right if she was living with her parents she would've had to have gone to a bad school? wow. oh but even in like, maybe My Girl and stuff she wants to (take) summer course (so she could go) write poetry you know, so sh- (is a really cool one too.) yeah  yeah but she actually does like a decent job for someone her age. yeah. cuz i would, you know yeah you always see like how the kids wanna do really well cuz they know they need to get a scholarship or     um have you ever_ oh wait you don't ha- do you have a U-MICH account? or do you just, not use it  i don't use Mulberry   i (only) (xx) i don't know, ha- like i don't use Yahoo so i don't know maybe i could go type it at like Angell or something and i could, ask those people those little guys in the computer center  the computer guys yeah. yeah they (could know) maybe i'll have to go do that rather than in the comfort of my own home. um, so no. um... we started out with a statistic on_ it says  were you guys sta- surprised at the ratio in our group of single parents to, like me having married parents or,    i think cuz i've thought about it um, like all your friends a lot of people i know (most people) even if their parents are together now, it's like a remarriage. uhuh yeah   oh my god i think it sucks. um so the next, thing that we talk about, is how society assumes that fathers are less involved, that was our nother s- another stereotype. um, and we talk about like Disneyland dads and how, when they do, go see their k- children it's like they're doing fun things and, you know they don't necessarily, aren't involved in the everyday activities that the moms have to deal with, um that's, that's like definitely in the stereotype like research so it's that  and then we, um, show that how this is revealed in one of the articles, and we talk about how, like cuz in my article it says single fathers tend to worry about losing custody of their children, and how in the media we'll always see like moms will get the custody like in a custody battle they'll always get sole custody. and that shows how like, at least we're arguing that it shows that, you know society feels that men aren't able to take care of their children it's the woman's job. um, and then we go on to talk about it in Liar Liar, um in Save the Last Dance, Big Daddy... um   yeah i have an article too that says like about three years. so,  which i can imagine like, if you think about just dealing with your like boyfriend relationship or something like, i can't imagine losing that and then s- like, being like okay i still have to function  yeah, i agree    but then, obviously she was i guess it depends on why maybe you get a divorce. yeah. right um and then we talk about economic status, being a big stereotype. aw, there's my boyfriend. and, but it seems like s- we were having a hard time like i said, trying to, single out like father stereotypes and, cuz the economic status definitely     poor   factory teachers, which don't make  One Fine Day? yeah i've seen it. that's i've seen it too, and doesn't she though even though she's doing okay economically doesn't she have more problems, yeah,    that he has a really laid back job and like i think a lot of women feel like, they  um no thanks. for mine i did the economic status and like the jobs they always have, bad jobs. um, and i have a statistic from my article that says, well it says something about the feminization of poverty, and that fifty percent of female headed households are living at or beneath the poverty line. um, and then i did mhm do you see him?  oh and i did the stereotype with like, that's, in movies the single mothers aren't necessarily like single, and in journals like that they always have_ cuz like in all my movies they had like, their mothers or their, you know like someone else that they could  did you watch um, One Fine Day? uhuh, yeah. yep. so it's kinda interesting to see like how men, they either need like another girlfriend or like      (xx) in One Fine Day she sort of has her mom. uhuh she like she wasn't f- there for that day but you could tell that she was like i- i'll baby-sit anytime.  yeah  As Good as it Gets her mom is there. but from a family not from a sexual relationship one of the other things that we thought_ maybe you remember this scene well, i thought we'd could include it in our section two was um, from One Fine Day when she's like daddy i'm hungry or whatever and he tries to like hand her um like a Lifesaver or something  yeah     don't put_ cuz i had, i had two Michelle Pfeiffer movies and i had, Meg Ry- i don't know. i feel like i was watching her a lot. i love When a Man Loves a Woman. i know i i cry uhuh... (xx) that's funny too cuz i, i was watching and then, i got, had to go somewhere or something, and it was right at like the huge like climax like when you usually start crying. and so i didn't think i would cuz like, uhuh cuz those little girls are so   will they (xx) economics the like s- support what about you Tonya did you me? mine's gonna be like economics too but like, my article's kinda about education also like, there's all the stereotypes that like,   really?   make time to spend. (that's okay.) that's a good one to compare  see i don't, me myself i wouldn't consider that quality time. you would say it is or it's not? i s- would say it wasn't quality time cuz like when i think of quality time it's like, doing something that you both enjoy. mhm but at the same time they need like, they need that, help and understanding and patience and   rather than saying go do your homework which shows if you're sitting there like, okay now two plus two and if you're like pulling the bananas out or whatever y- yeah sure. when, d- you have class at ten? uhuh when are you gonna go i don't know. or at least just give me the main points that you want in it, if we don't actually write it out i can write it out but just tell me what you think we need to say about um, we could do that like if, we just say, whatever we wanna say, and then if we write a conclusion together for sure, like when all of us have our, papers like next week sometime, when we meet then we can decide that. cuz i think in the introduction  yeah... oops. cuz i know i'm gonna be a side in your thorns with my schedule next week.  and i kn- i know she has class at ten are you guys, all leaving at ten? or i have to go to work. okay... i have to go to Toronto. where do you have to go? Toronto lucky ooh i'm going to see one of my friends i'm so excited. what time? five.     we're listening to the Empire   yeah um, let's see. mm what about the two thirty slot on Tuesday? okay   is_ do you get done at class at two thirty is that was that what it was? i get done at two fifteen, but yeah  i think we need to have meeting earlier though just to make sure everything's could we could we maybe have two meetings? yeah. so then that way like,  cuz we could have a goal for what needs to be done    Thursday i don't think i tutor next week i think it's cancelled, s- but Thursday i might have to go to Detroit at two thirty. that's not positive though. what about,  yeah.   the UGLI? UGLI?   i don't care. (me neither) i mean what's close to where you guys are? this. i'm at home. i'm at, dance. i'm at the C-C-R-B dance building...   UGLI's fine. till what time? two thirty to...  what does, what does everyone do_ what time are you leaving Friday? i would assume, sometime in the morning.   um, when? cuz your show's at eight, isn't it? yeah i have to be there at six though. right... m- you were going to Detroit on Thursday? i do on Thursdays but i think next weekend's cancelled. i'm, but i'm not positive (though.) the_ okay. i mean i can but i have class until one and then i have to go to Detroit at two thirty. cuz um i mean i can meet Friday morning like if we did like another early morning meeting i cou- my parents are visiting. i guess i mean,  oh i see. we could meet Thursday during the day. i'll just plan on it being cancelled.  does that sound good with everyone else? yeah what time,   two thirty? okay can you do that? i have class two to four. (alright) i have to work at five. alright. what about, what time does everyone start class on  Thursday i have class_ i have dance i don't have class until eleven on Thursday. i have class at ten. i have class from nine thirty to two fifteen straight. mm what about the morning? what if we met at, eight, yeah Thursday morning. um and like that'll basically just be the time like that, we get together and basically finalize everything. do we wanna meet at the Fishbowl?    that's eight at the  right yeah     eight yeah because we probably have to have (every) (xx) well what do we wanna get done for Tuesday? yeah, well the introduction needs to be done. and if we_ do you guys wanna write, the conclusion and come to like the summary on Thursday? or is that pushing it is like that getting too late? um, or do you wanna have it done before that? i think that i_ that would be fine i don't really to do it on Thursday? yeah i don't think that's pushing it cuz somebody can do the final touches over the weekend, maybe yeah and then just like, somebody could just kinda organize it so it, it um like flows like with all the headings and whatever and  i don't,     yeah yeah cuz this weekend's a lot busier for me actually than next weekend, so that's not a problem.   next weekend's  no this is the      i do. yeah i don't have class till noon on Monday and today. i mean i wouldn't count on that  just if something happened, we still have like two hours after class... um so for Tuesday do we want, for sure like a  yeah yep. do you guys think we should exchange it and revise each other's part parts? yeah why don't we do that? why don't we make copies for Tuesday? on Tuesday? Tuesday, and then give 'em to each other, and then for Thursday bring them back and just,  so are we doing five copies each or just one copy? five, yeah     if you can also like uh within your paper if had, cited anything, uh write like a little citation section for your paper so that way, we all know we can just put it  and um citation-wise though, i don't know, Lorri and i were kinda confused about that last night  was     i think we'll probably have to use A-P-A style, i believe for this, like for the citations and like typing it up or whatever. so um,  um, do you guys want me, to maybe not make four copies of it but make a copy of the literature review what i end up sending her?    oh. yeah. i wonder when she'll get that back to us. sh- didn't she have some big thing to do this weekend?  this weekend she said she was gonna be gone. so she said get it to her today. i think did she say she was gonna be gone next week too?   oh okay yeah yeah yep and then if you get a email from her can you, send it, to us, to see what she says? i i or me i'm just curious. sure i totally thought one of you guys were s- singing along to the C-D i didn't realize it was the singer. intro. do you know what you're gonna write? um, just basically_ no i i don't like what do you guys think yeah okay. maybe s- okay. so basically, we're talking about  how they're represented in the media ugh do you think i need to be, uh more specific than that?     it's    okay and i i know you tried to email it too so, sorry you had to   i feel like any time i try to do like, a big email to like a friend that i haven't_ that i don't see very often and i try to, like i'm like do this big catch them up on everything that's going on with my life it doesn't go yeah. um, if should we also talk about in the intro like some of the s- uh stereotypes that we found? yeah (that i was saying) okay well it says on here it like according to her that she wants us to talk about,   film and television  i don't      um... except that they showed that the_ except that they assume that the two parent family's more successful and i didn't think that my two parent families were having successful, right what about the f- what about the fact that like, single mothers, like the differences between the single mothers and single fathers like i is that what we expect in_ yeah i guess it is what we expect  (yeah but) it needs to be, probably pretty specific though like, what stereotypes did we support and what didn't we? you know what i mean? mhm yeah and that's what she may list, some of the yeah  so again that work of support (xx) uhuh okay um, fathers being less involved was another one of ours. yeah my last one was, the mothers were seen as like, less emot- like mentally stable. okay di- is that supported?      okay. there might be a s- (xx) i don't know if these are the ones i'm, officially gonna focus on but, the ones that i were th- i was, mostly thinking about is that, they have like a two parent family they have each other to lean on so, it's more balanced um, bec- in terms of their relationship but also the time that they spend with their kids. cuz one of them can be working and one can be w- focusing on the kids or, whatever, and then the other thing is that the little things are always taken care of. okay. bless you. and i think in general that a lot of them were, met. through media, observation, supported. i think a lot of_ that they were, in general supported by the media observation.   right   i   i think i understand what you're saying... um i do feel like this is coming, together more than i thought it, could, doing a f- a fifteen page group paper. it's just hard cuz all of our segments are kinda disjointed at first and we're like all working on them separately so it's hard to, but i  i don't know hopefully you'll find it_ i honestly felt when you guys, gave me, cuz i- like, a detailed summary, um i felt like i could easily put it into, a structure that all flowed together mhm   i think it'll just be putting it together, and just making it flow and it's like we have all the little pieces. can one of you, or, do you think that, i don't know how does that intro, sound? like are you hot?    i wonder if we_ should we move back there? well i guess we're not gonna be here too much longer are we? i yeah i do feel okay with the intro i just um... well i mean i'll give it to you guys to see like i wish i was able to read what you guys had all written, because that would (kind of) help me  i think we could_ i don't know. what do you guys feel about including in the intro, maybe stereotypes that we've, come upon in our life not necessarily from our re- from the articles or from, the movies but, what we thought we would've gotten, initially just from, when you think about single parents? i don't know. yeah like cuz i was gonna say we cuz i think we all, we all came in with like, a load on our back of what we were assuming,     what were the what? what were your s- like what stereotypes did you think of before   i woulda thought all the things we know. the, i don't think the stereotypes are very shocking.  right  and i guess no i agree i feel_ i think um, maybe it's like the causes that we have like, incorrect like the (use about) like for instance like the single fathers like the reason they were talking about them being less involved a lotta times is because, they just at first they don't know how to be involved in their kids lives like they haven't  cuz society assumes that that's the  and so then because he's pretty much been the breadwinner and he's let her do that, like he's let her just kinda control that area, that like when it comes down to it he only knows like to do recreational things with the kids because, that's all, that that's all he knows. or like for mothers' like psychological well-being if you're already making a lot less money than, you know what i mean if you're having trouble like s- financially supporting yourself plus  plus, um with dads i mean if moms are generally awarded sole custody like, even if the dads wanna be involved that's harder for them to be involved in the kid's life like, yeah i think it's because society like applies that preconceived notion that dads won't be as good as a parent so (like) (xx) almost always award custody to the mom instead. i think with being less involved i think a lotta times society, assumes that the dad doesn't wanna be there. right cuz like in the movies i watched where the, the wife died, the father did a really good job as being like the single parent you know what i mean like, he took over that role very well but when it was just when they were just divorced, he still left a lot of things to the   dysfunctional    and then, maybe on Tuesday we can have someone, i don't know how i wanna i was just maybe gonna have someone take the stuff, and try to, put it all together for Thursday, but if you guys want to do that over the weekend, next weekend then you know,  but if we could if if somebody has time to do it before Thursday, the more times we edit it the better the paper is gonna be the better we're gonna do. i don't know i could do it if you guys, email it to me like, you can either do it via attachment but um, just in case for some reason the attachment doesn't open if you could also put it in the body, of the email, just like whatever it is that you've written. like cut and  cuz i could start to put it together so that like we have it all on like one    Thur- like Thursday.   but she's saying it might be easier if you can email it to her      cuz then that way, when she opens your attachment with the email, it'll be, it's all there  do you guys wanna do that then? do you wanna email me what you've done so far? yeah     like bring the        um, what's your email address? W O N T W O N T T E, L L, at U-MICH so we have... three hours? we have roughly three hours of group meetings planned for next week? are there any other like questions or anything...? so is that okay with everyone then to like email it to me? does that work? (okay) and you guys all honestly felt that the literature review_ i mean it's gonna be formalized more but, was okay? yeah   yeah. 	1
LES280JG138.json	okay on focus? alright? i've discovered you guys are all much more sensitive to that than i am so, uh okay, we've been talking about uh formal structural models of the retirement process. uh, we did the Gustman and Steinmeier, model last class and today, um, guess we'll spend all the time on so-called option value models Lumsdaine, Stock and Wise, although we'll get a small head start in thinking about uh, dynamic programming models as well because part of what they do is compare their preferred model, to one that is still the more elaborate. uh... basically the the, theme of the paper, um is to compare, three models of increasing complexity, using exactly the same data. and, just as a general... point about doing research, bu- on the same data, is a really nice feature of this paper. because normally what happens when you try to teach a course like this, is that you have, researchers and models, and data, and you hope that the differences and conclusions are  today we we have no... handout? oh i'm sorry, (xx) handouts. thanks but that's a problem because it's like, when they will model_ i don't know the model but when they will model their choice of going into retirement, people who retire don't think of_ just about that but about missing opportunities. th- that's particularly important for the application that they're going to have. so the_ yeah the i mean um, well lemme, yes th- part of what the paper is about, is about retirement in normal times. okay? um and once you make a kind of_ one can have a discussion within oneself about whether, partial retirement jobs or omitting partial retirement jobs or not modeling partial retirement jobs is an important flaw in that context. um they're going to apply it to an early-out window. okay? which is, a deliberate attempt to get people who are not really ready to retire, to retire to leave... okay? and so the early retirement window is going to induce people who otherwise wouldn't be retiring, to leave early, and the question of what they do after they leave is is kind of doubly important. okay? so for the the group of workers that that that they would be studying um, normally uh the issue of what happens to them after leaving the firm is potentially important. for the group of workers who are be- whose departure is being accelerated by the early-out window, uh the issue of what they do afterwards is doubly important. and and you know what this reflects is just the fact that, uh you know we started out saying here's a model, here're all the things we would like to fix about that model, and now we're gonna watch the papers try to fix them one or two at a time. okay, so this is one that as you'll see is going to not do a very good job, uh with_ is not going to do anything really about modeling what happens after you leave the firm, um but it does a very good job with other things and, so it's a it's a,  so so what, what this, what these uh, nineteen eighty-two  so what but they are the same mhm um  yeah it depends also on the learning process. so let let me come back to that and you'll_ i'll give you sort of a simple example of where they would be striking error. but one of the things it's going to depend on is, um, sort of how, uh h- how the error terms line up over time. whether you can learn_ whether observing today's error term tells you something important about tomorrow's error term. because then there's some gain from waiting until you can observe today's error term. w- w- we'll come back to that. and we'll actually t- talk i think more about it on Thursday as well. okay? um  well no it's not through the discount factor so much right because this cou- this is sort of present versus future and this is just a matter of do i have to work for the money or not? yeah but, that will be the same thing it's like because that would mean that you would more heavily discount the, that's actually very similar to saying that you, more heavily discount the future after you start you start retirement... ah  he notes though, you have a (sine N) there so do you really need an expectation T there? i mean you know that, right? no i don't know how happy i'm gonna be right cuz i don't know what the (xx) yeah but i'm talking about in time T, the for the second part of that. um, wouldn't you  okay, alright thanks what's K-T of (xx) yeah? okay  like if you have like (a rash) uh, adaptive expectation they should be the same. uhh no. or very similar,  wait where they would be the same?  well maybe there's some information that like you know like you know is coming some, renegotiation or well okay gimme a_ well there's a particular      mm you kept going though you didn't stop. well i meant it to include things not just graduate school alright? ah no   so from the firm's perspective why would they offer higher bonuses to people who are closer to sixty-five? uh probably because they desperately wanna get those people out. i mean i- in the optimal design of these things is actually quite complicated um, it depends so, how does this, comply with the critical focus because it said that when you this i don't know this seems like very, problematic for me from the Lucas point of view, in which he said that when you change the the policy like when you change the policy so people change their, expectations so we should not expect the uh rationally not expect that, anything would happen. okay well well so far we're still talking about the, kind of normal policy. okay so nineteen eighty, was a normal year not the year of the early retirement window. okay so i think that's, where you more have the Lucas problem is um what happens once they offer the window and how does that change people's expectations. okay? the story line that they're going to want you to accept i believe, um which i think is probably okay in this application and maybe not as okay in other applications, is that this was really seen where the window was really seen as a once and for all, experience. and so, it really didn't, change people's expectations a- although i'll talk about a subtle way in which it might have even if it were a one off. l- let me come back to that i- i'll i won't answer it fully but i i'll at least, touch on that issue, um the way in which that would where you_ i wouldn't have called it the Lucas critique but actually you'll you'll see it in in the next slide. okay? so for predicting who retires in nineteen eighty which is normal times all of the models do about equally well. um but for predicting the response to the window, um the two more sophisticated models do much better. okay? and why is that? well we kind of, let the cat out of the bag a couple slides ago right? we said that, if you're a probit person and they offer you six months' pay to leave now, and you think about do i wanna leave now or work another year, then you wanna leave now. right? but if you're a, option value or a stochastic dynamic programming person you say well if i leave now i won't be able to work till sixty-five like i was planning to do. so i'll compare that six months' of pay, against, not just working one more year where it clearly wouldn't make sense to do so but, whole bunches of future years. and if i think about it that way it's a much less attractive option. okay so basically the option value and the stochastic dynamic programming models get right the idea that the window is not very attractive to people who were planning on staying a good while longer. and the probit model doesn't get that and so the probit model basically predicts that everybody will wanna leave. okay? and i'm slightly exaggerating. but basically it will overpredict how many people'll want to leave. and so what i think that the the paper clearly does, is it shows that the kinds of sophistication that are in the option value or the stochastic dynamic program models, are really quite important uh for problems where the incentives become, sharply nonlinear at one point in time as they do, obviously with an early-out window. i mean to be honest i'm surprised given the early retirement, accrual spike um that the probit does as well as it does. okay that is i would have thought that the probit would have had problems uh predicting that people would retire the year before_ two years before early retirement. uh whereas the option value and the S-D-P would tend to get that right too. um so i'm actually surprised the probit does as well as it does. um, but but that's what they find. so but would that would mean would actually, retire from that firm even earlier...  okay so so but can you say something is like when they_ to what extent like i could expect that K should be, less not not more? um i'm not sure which parameter it would bias. i mean o- one of the, problems with these nonlinear models is that as soon as you notice something wrong, you're kind of, you don't have the intuition that you have in a linear model, about which parameter it would likely bias. um, mkay just to wrap up cuz we're running out of time, uh, the zero mean innovations to the error term. okay? um this is the idea that the marginal utility of leisure increases with age. what's kind of strikingly missing from the paper is, age or time as an independent determiner of retirement. okay so we don't have health in there we let health be in the error term. but the error term's a zero mean. taken literally that means that if the error term reflects health i'm not getting sicker as i get older. and while we would like that to be true we kinda suspect it's not. okay so there's nothing in the model that's capturing the intuition that as people get older, on average it gets harder for them to show up for work... um this gets now to Mato's point. even if i think that the window offer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, okay which is actually probably how these workers saw it, there's still the issue of how does that policy change by the firm change the expectation of the workers. and i think you could reasonably expect that the window offers would even if it did nothing else even if it didn't lead workers to expect another window offer in a year, it probably should revise their forecasts about their earnings. i mean a booming vibrant firm does not say hey guys, wouldn't you like to retire? alright a firm that says, hey guys wouldn't you like to retire is probably a firm that's having trouble. if the firm is in some sense that desperate is it likely to be giving ten percent wage increases to the people that stay next year? right after having, asked me politely would i like to leave in exchange for a small, subsidy, this year, are they likely to offer me the big bucks as a raise next year if i stay? well probably not. okay so the model assumes that this firm is a stable and stodgy enough large employer that if you know your earnings at fifty-five you can pretty well guess your earnings at sixty-five. and whatever the reliability of that assumption in normal times, you would think that, people might change their expectations about, future retirement. in some sense what would get you to retire in response to the window, is a combination of the dreck financial incentive which is modeled, and the implicit bad news about your career prospects at this firm, which are not modeled, okay? so suppose somebody didn't respond to the financial incentive of the window offer at all, but said hey, this likely means that, my remaining years at this firm are not going to be as but if you're comparing_ if you're just trying to compare the option value to the probit, and the probit said that too many people le- th- this would, this would mean that pe- more people would leave than would otherwise here,  (xx) (you know) next week we we don't have (time) let's try for Friday and then with the option to cancel how's that? i i would feel  oh Friday doesn't work okay (xx) so it's like not the best, time (to meet) fine um because i the trouble is i ca- i can't, now (xx) come to the point uh be on uh s- be stuck with the empirical question. okay well uh, let's see what would would work Monday on Monday it's from one to two thirty or, or how about two o'clock, would that two two-thirty does that work for you? yeah that's fine. did you leave entire bag (xx) it was i- it was on purpose, i had to go to the_ see  that's not the problem because, i have done at least some examples (xx.) 	1
SEM475MX041.json	far you got in the readings and what, readings you did. uh i read the first uh just up to transparency on phenomenal illusions and, (actually) finished reading  yeah. yeah finished reading the one from    how far'd you get   no i haven't read Tye okay so we don't have any overlap alright um  yeah. yeah. those are the sort of the cases that (we) presented on the, first, day, right the the case of the, two trees (with) the two trees we already talked about that? first day   alright. okay. so we talked about, and also y- y- y- you've raised it in another thing that you wrote uh, talking about the, um... i forget exactly exactly how you'd how you worked it out but we did talk about some. okay then um, then, i i i i figured with the shorter, shortened week we might be like this so i, brought some stuff to... to do. not so we weren't driven just by your questions. um, but if you have stuff you wanna raise about what you read i_ what i would do, left to my own devices is to, tell you what i'm trying to do in this, phenomenal illusions paper. summary form and stuff like that. um, if you have questions about Tye, u- i- if you say we'd already discussed it then it might not be (hard) if you... if you  yeah this this was just the very beginning. that, uh talks about, uh uh Sartre's contention, uh that, we are under the illusion, that we have an image. uh, uh the the statement on on on this account, uh I'll read the sentence before this  no. the illusion of eminence. you see from like the first page or second page (or so) this is the only quote. yeah. right right. whatever. you may (have) right okay. the illusion of eminence. (but) it doesn't matter the words (you use) uhuh. it's, what what what's puzzling me about is that is that suppose i have an image in my mind of a, of a red fire truck, that's what he says that's what i think too that's what almost, everyone thinks but, you know, does that surprise you? w- you know that there's nothing (red)   alright. right yeah you don't an experience made of red, um  okay. so   okay. (alright.) okay. um uh alright so um, what i'm trying to do, is, is a is a bunch of things at once, um i- one of_ that paper that we did last time i'm trying to argue for the inner perception model from, a priori considerations right? mhm mhm. are the two mistakes of thinking that you have, through the the red that's out there, on the the transparency or the, diaphanous of  yeah the the the the the, the two illusions one, i should start calling it the likeness illusion rather than the image illusion but the the one, is roughly_ i'm gonna, hafta modify this later but roughly, the one illusion the image illusion is that you have, mental objects, with nonmental properties. um, so, a thing in your head a an image, a visual image that's_ has shape. uh um or, color, or size (something) motion, or uh um, or a uh, or a sound in your head a song in your head, uh kinda sound rhythm pitch and so forth. when there's nothing in your head (with) a- any of that stuff. um or in your mind or soul or whatever. um, so that's mental objects with nonmental properties and nicely (sort of) the transparency illusion is that there's nonmental objects, environmental objects bodily objects, nonben- nonmental objects with, mental properties some kind of, uh uh weird, dependent on your mind properties so, so um, the idea that, um... that uh um, you know the wall there not only has, um, uh shape, location, um, uh, mass, reflectance but also has, um, uh, a particular kinda shape look that can vary as you move or, or or reflectance look that can vary, according to, your sense organs, some some or or o- o- o- um, uh, the, the transparency illusion's harder to make out but it's but, the the best kind of examples i have is when you have a, shapes a, curved shape. and you, a- a- s- and mathematically or physically there's a, a a a be some account of curvature, and that's a property i'm not saying there's an illusion there, (xx) nonmental object really has that nonmental property, but, in perception it seems like it's got more properties than that, shape-related property so not only does it s- so you, you look at, you can you can be sensitive to the look of a, curve or the feel of a curve a blind person could. like you detect the feel of a curve. and, and uh a curve, look and a curve feel, the chair also seems to have the those properties, stuck on it, objectively it doesn't seem even though, even though... what a curve looks like and what a curve feels like are different from one another, and they're but even though they're detecting the same feature, they um curvature, uh they, um, uh, a- uh, and those differences, so i i we try to argue, do most likely depend on, the constitution of your sense organs, and, brain and so forth. uh uh uh um it doesn't seem like they do it doesn't seem like you help create, the look of the chair or the curve or or the feel of it it seems like you just passively discover it, um, and, so that's the sense in which a property, feature that really is, dependent on you seems not to be. and that's the transparency illusion. uh but, but, so so   right.   'm'm no alright but yeah i discuss that too (xx) that's a good question i'll keep it (xx) h- sorry how would you classify uh, these properties that Tye uses in the paper to talk about the illusions like looking,  oh looking bigger from here you should (xx) yeah. there is one little c- self-contained, section of my paper where i talk about, i talk about that and what he says is so weird, yeah. yeah. (xx) it's not long after this here's Peacock's case abbreviated and and this is, ah right. yeah that's it (xx) yes. yeah. right sure.    (mhm) i mean wh- look okay f- now do something do_ that doesn't involve do do auditory imagining, task that doesn't involve, or needn't involve, visual imagination. just, i'll be quiet and you, um you know sing to yourself some song you like some happy birthday or whatever right? uh um, do it.  yeah i was doing it fast. the end might be different.    you're bli-dih-dih-dih-dih-dih-duh  (okay.) okay. well that_ well then then don't imagine you singing a song imagine um um, imagine Elvis singing imagine just sort of listening to Elvis. alright and suppose you don't have any delusions right of uh, you know, or so not hav(ing to imagine) you know. some, body you have no chance of imitating like uh Barbra Streisand or someone. yeah. (xx) still. uh um, uh uh... uh okay well, all that was an aside it was kinda fun but it's just an aside the, the um, the, i wanna say both what seems weird about, (wait a minute) what seems weird about, alleged images but also um uh, uh certain kinds of, uh (xx) feelings and bodily sensations and so forth is that, is that um... is that the objects_ there see- there seem to be objects. but they seem to be, private (xx) one one, one perceiver and one modality in that perceiver. um, uh in the transparency case, which is more like normal perception case... (xx) it's usually no question of the objects you're seeing, or objects you're perceiving, can be, you can perceive in, in a number of ways and others can perceive, uh um but... um um um (xx) let me ask a ask a sorta (xx) related question oh you (xx) mhm mhm (xx) well an explosion, all around you, is just gonna be, loc- hard to locate it's gonna seem like, you're gonna be, when you try to imagine it. uh imagine especially if you imagine shards entering your body from all directions or you're imagining it all around you. (i don't know if,) it would be quite right to say, although how it might be tempting to say, that you were, visually imagining it, from all directions cuz you know your visual field doesn't, go all around your, body your head. but,  so, particularly your_ you were there in a car or something and the windshield  yeah. we- because it's a memory of a_ an episodic memory of a specific event? or...  i i i, yeah it it it might be that this, conjecture, that, uh, that monomodality captures what seems ghostly, about... alleged phenomenal objects like images, is wrong. that could be that could be said that could be that could be right. uh um, but um, um, (the,) the uh, i don't mean (it's) yet shown to be right by a particular, case like this because, um, because, um, um the question... see yeah? yeah. in the in the original car going by going zoom case i was just asking you to think about, where is the, car image where is the visual car image and where is the auditory car image and are they in the same place? that's a crude way to ask what really matters which is, does the visual does the picture of the car seem loud? um uh um does the ca- does the alleged car image seem to be making noise? uh uh uh and this this question about where they are is just proxy because if the sound is completely somewhere else it_ you know that would be good enough but even if they converge by coincidence or especially in the case where because both are big. right. right. right right.   can i just say yeah.  no no. the, when what's (cuz) regular old, perception case regular old perception case. (alright.)  right.  y- you could you can be aware that you're having the experience of green. right. right right right  in a perceptual case what this book's saying is that, the only f- when you_ when you try to introspect the normal case of perception you, only detect the two_ the following two kinds of features. um, either features that, um um seem, stuck on objects. they seem to be uh independent of your, perception and not sort of floating, in the air between you and the object you're focusing on, and they seem to be something you don't uh, you you don't create or participate in in any way. (it seems) to be ou- ou- outside, so you detect you detect those kind of, features and you detect, the property uh that you have of representing them. okay? uh and that's it. so when people say, you know when when when people say, if you, like Peacock maybe if you, if you attend to your visual experience you will notice it has certain, intrinsic features or something like that that's, what they say doesn't happen. uh the two_ maybe you (already) mentioned before the blurriness. we're not tempted to attribute the blurriness to the object. right. there was a joke once o- on David Letterman did a a, monologue joke once where he says you know uh uh this, new reports from NASA about the Hubble telescope you know say that you know what they've discovered is that space is really blurry. so, um our best telescopes confirm right. so it wasn't a waste of money. um okay the, the, yeah um so are people willing to grant that that say clarity or doubled a double image or, or blurriness that,  s- s- so what what's being represented when you when you s- s- i mean there's the  right. yeah but no i did- i didn't say you, see   okay. uh uh um y- y- i- you cross your eyes, or something and y- and uh, and and uh the watch seems to have a certain relation to you- tip of your nose be on the left of_ be on the left of your nose, and it seems to be on the right of your nose. you may pick one or one may dominate but you have these, but you, but you have these two yeah. i- i- i- and not be fooled inter- interesting case al- along that line is the the the sweatshirts, that are intentionally printed, so it looks like, it's blurred. and you_ sort of (if) you look at it and your first te- your first (attempt) is (to) sort of squint to get it right, and then you then you then you realize no it's printed, to look uh to look uh blurry. mhm he's incredibly ingenious did you did you go to his talk,  yeah cuz i mean... i don't remember all the details but, uh you have, objections from (xx) saying things like well, exactly this kind of thing can't can't_ it's, (childish) saying that Tye can't, re, capture, the apparent difference between, having a, blurry vision of a clear object and a clear image a clear vision of a blurry object or something and (Tye) said well you know i do (xx) i don't remember his (xx) but yeah that's relevant and it, and it may come up in the, i gave you a whole stack of Tye stuff last time. mhm earlier i diverted the conversations to say a little bit about, transparency and you were gonna talk about, uh image. if you wanna go back   right well, right well i'm glad it doesn't seem plausible to you but i don't know if that would be a good response. i mean... well what seems seems least plausible (xx) when you talk about uh, the loud oscilloscope, uh reading uh, uh, there i- it's when we, when we draw our attention to the oscilloscope we're not tempted to say that it itself is loud. but if we draw our attention to  right. yeah (that's) so, that's why, i think, what's going on is really, an illusion case. mkay. i um  uh, um... it's not built into the notion of illusion that it's phenomenal. no uh uh uh um um all i i- and i don't_ actually you don't, even care whether the appearance is false and uh that's for the larger aim of arguing for, inner perception you're gonna need inner perception even if there really are red images, uh in your head. um you wouldn't be able to see them so you'd hafta ( have inner) but um um, but uh, and there's also some funny stuff about calling it an illusion rather than a hallucination properly speaking it's_ these are hallucinations, on the same view it's not that there's, it's not like where where the hallucination, like an oasis case there's nothing there dominantly responsible for the experience right  oh oh um um, uh... i i, i'm happy to say there could be subliminal illusions uh uh uh um or that a robot can suffer from illusion i mean i- i- i- if there was a robot or a pigeon or something that some_ suppose we somehow knew it didn't have, phenomenal consciousness. it could still be under an illusion that there- the Mueller Lire illusion and so forth. uh uh uh or so in one sense of it being being under an illusion is  but part again there there there are illusions, i mean part of what's, okay if illusion can sometimes be used (to mean) (xx) you're you're mistaken you thought something was the case but it wasn't the case, um, but um there is another sense of what i- visual illusion. something seems to you to be, something or to be some way it's not in fact. um, the, the usual way (in which) you talk about that is the things out there aren't the way in which they seem to us. you think you see water and it's in fact, the the the heat rising off the the desert that gives this, uh illusion to you of of water. there's something outside which is giving giving rise to it but you're, you're you're misinterpreting it. um but in that case you still have the the phenomenal_ there's a phenomenal experience. yeah yeah   yeah (right) suppose (xx) apart from whether or not you can have non-phenon- nonphenomenal uh, sorta perceptual, uh when when i think of the uh, uh uh i imagine a red fire truck or a red object a red ball or something like that um, uh the, to say that it's an illusion that it's red, um uh, the... i mean regardless of whether there's anything red it's not a matter of my, being wrong about whether there was something red. if i thought there was something red in my head that would be an illusion in the, in the sort of objective reference, sense. but to say, it didn't_ it wasn't, really red it just seemed red, seems to be a- an impossible turn of speech. that, if it if it seems red than it seems red and i may be mistaken about, uh it referring to anything. but, if it i- at least there's a there's a a prima facie uh i think needs to be overthrown that in fact uh when you seem to uh have an ex- an inner experience of uh a red image a red ball, uh if it seems red, the the phenomenal part of it, isn't just an illusion. i mean you really did have, in other words you you're not mistaken that you did have that phenomenal experience. uh you're mistaken if you thought that it applied some objective, object out there that actually had, the the property of being red such that someone looked at it, uh they would see something red. um i didn't follow all that are you saying there's a certain, um common sense view that you you you are daring to argue out of? okay i accept the dare. what's the, i i i i imagine i'll i'll stick with this this example for a while the claim is just mhm i say you don't have this_ i i i i don't put it like that i would say cuz cuz uh uh y- that wouldn't be an image illusion. to say that, um, it's true that you have an experience of a red ball. okay in thinking of red image there we're talking about image in terms of a physical image? or, uh a mental yeah. yeah.  the point of this is the point of this is yeah uh uh i i i'm i'm gonna say there's no such thing as, mental images there's no such thing as, mental likenesses generally so there's no, uh pain objects that are sharp, you know and and that are are burning or throbbing, there are no, orgasms, there are no um, sounds uh mental sounds uh uh um i- j- but there are, states, that say there are, those things. uh uh uh those kind of objects it it feels to you like there's a pain in your tooth. it feels to you it seems to you it looks to you (really) like there's an image in your mind. duh duh duh duh. when you really are in those states of, misrepresenting that there are these, mental likenesses.   i agree there's this initial appearance and then i would say it lasts until you die. you know you wanna say i guess you can get rid of it. i don't think you get rid of it by thinking about it and i d- y- i don't think you get r- i don't think you get rid of that appearance, by but  maybe it's flat or something (right) yeah (mkay) i- i- i- i'm not saying much different than what Smart is saying about the images. the the uh i, i didn't underst- i heard and underst- i think i understood, your, where you started saying (like) i'm not, and maybe you said much i don't remember i'm not much tempted to, think that was your word, that there's a red picture. yeah i'm not at all. uhuh uhuh uhuh physical images of some sort. physical what are you calling a physical i_  no  right okay right.   yeah the the subjective state is real  it does seem that there is a uh uh a reality to the subjective experience that i have. that means it does seem that the experience exists. the experience exists  all i wanna know is does the experience seem red? does the experience seem red. all you've told me so far about this experience is that it exists. does it seem to have any other features? like having a color?  but if you say it's an experience of s- red you gotta suppose it's an experience of a red patch or something. i mean you don't have to suppose that there really is a patch but it's but all i want is that you got an experience, and according to that experience there is something red.  even yeah that's all i'm saying. but there's nothing red there really so it's an illusion. well there's nothing physically red. i don't understand nonphysically red what do you mean physically red.  um um what's the conclusion? again? or the conclusion is that the the fact that, it seems a certain way sort of Thomas Nagel's uh there's a fact of subjective experience which is a, fact about the real world and how we incorporate it into, uh into our metaphysical scheme. uh that's another question but he contends and it it seems undeniable to me that there are facts of subjective experience that i have a the the there's a fact about my experience that it seems to be of a red, sphere when i form the image. okay i don't know what you're_ if that's your conclusion we we_ if that if that really is your conclusion we don't disagree, because all i'm saying is, uhuh (is)    it seems to you like there's something red that's the same. so far. uh the which seems to pick out something else. which then has it.  it's a property of my experience it's not a property,    okay. uh uh uh um i, i d- i don't even know what a phenomenal property is i'm talking about redness shape if if if redness is is confusing here talk about curvature. um two claims. uh well there is there are things curved in my head but_ m- my brains and   here here? they're_ these are both judgments, these are both these are both just propositions right but this state you're asking (isn't this) a judgment? i i'm neutral i don't care it was whatever, it it's that thing you were calling experience. okay right okay alright i think i'm very much inclined to say that there is something straight in my mind. alright alright   well then where is this thing that's straight. is, isn't what's behind that, some kind of a property-sharing view of representation? (that) you got it right so you have genuine properties of of of of,      part part part of the (xx) when you say nothing straight in my head uh uh the, when you have a a say a curved wire and you twist it around so you can't see the curvature, it will look straight.   and i would wanna say that when i c- when i when i turn the curved wire so that i can't see the the bend in it, mhm  well it's not really an image of a straight thing cuz i know that if i turn it it's not really straight. an image as of    what does phenomenally straight mean? it looks straight. the image looks straight. that's just to say this. i g- now now you're back you've come down here. to say, you're confusing something being straight with something being represented as straight.  yeah?     yeah what what's confus- what's unintelligible to me is uhuh yeah i didn't say it seems to you like you imagine a straight  yeah you don't think you could be mistaken about that, is what you're saying. it seems to me that there is a a prima facie, uh uh uh claim, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   an image  saying that there is wh- when i when i uh imagine a straight, when i have a straight line in my head. okay    alright  yeah now X i just did as a shorthand but i, i, we  i just meant X to mean something is straight. but it's actually true that something is straight in the universe i mean, that i am exp- that... uh uh uh and and uh, but roughly i mean that you know that uh, i, have an image in h- you know in here that is straight. that's what i really mean for X. so i have a visual internal state, affirming i have an image,  or that there is some straight in here. yeah i- i- i- i- it, the i is probably also misleading it should be you know, uh an image is straight or something like that. okay so there is a state, which, uh uh is affirming that there is, a straight image. yeah that's what i think's going on even when there is no straight image. yeah and it seems that what's happened there is that the phenomena has the phenomenal, uh feel one might say has dropped out. well that's your theory but i'm gonna claim that this explains phenomenal. uh uh uh um (i'm sorry) if you think see, if you think that this has to be, tru- tell me whe- at what poi- um i'm gonna point to things you tell me at what point has the, has_ have i denied that there's phenomenality. here? it can't be that already right here i've denied that, there's phenome-  all i've said is that there is a state there could be an- there could be any number of other things, in addition. let let's start here. certainly this claim is compatible, with there being phenomenal consciousness. i'm imagining straightness that that doesn't deny yet. add this claim. it just says a little more about this it doesn't say what there isn't, it's down here where i s- or up here where i say where, wh- that there isn't something. so if you're gonna say that it's this part this denial of this that says, cuz see this pa- this claim here doesn't say that this state is false or anything. it's this part that together with this says the state is false. so now wh- when i'm down here i'm starting to deny stuff. if you think that this, denial means denying that there's phenomenality then you're thinking that phenomenality requires images with these kind of features. and you're_ and then s- so there's your arg- you can do a_ you can write your own book other than Chalmer- like to the same effect as Chalmers and get, from taking phenomenal consciousness seriously straight to dualism. yeah it's it's the there is a_ there is a visual internal state... that affirms a proposition inste- the proposition, uh it doesn't gonna have any phenomenal quality in that brackets is there? or does it get snuck in in the brackets that you have, visual state affirms, (xx) okay yeah but the state doesn't deny that there's something it just says there's this.  no but i can i can say affirm that there is a uh red spherical ball, and uh do it quickly enough or in a way in which i don't form an image, of a red spherical ball. and it seems as though all that statement is saying is there's an internal state that's affirming, the proposition of a red spherical ball, which doesn't seem to include, the phenomenal character of what in fact is going on and what i'm imagining. okay i i i i hear that claim. uhuh right right  yeah  this state says something is straight in my brain or mind or soul or body.  yeah and you you're suggesting that that constitutes phenomenality. i haven't argued for that yet, right  what? where? where? (this) one this is shape this means shape man. uh uh um and i know nothing_ i- o- if we we could we could we could, i can demonstrate some straight things to you but i'm not making a distinction between phenomenal and nonphenomenal physical and nonphysical straightness. straight means you know, an edge that lies along the shortest path between two points and so forth you know. um that's one thing yeah i- i- i- (an extent)  okay then then, give me my words straight if you want me to choose a different noise for that feature i will. all i care about is that it seems to you like there's something with that feature. but there's nothing with that feature. if you wanna, take every word i use and give it a second meaning and deny the claims in those other meanings fine but y- then we're not arguing. uh uh uh um okay? so, so um um i mean that was sorta the whole point of trying to do_ go to this, to stick with shape was that it was something we could, hold fixed if you switch to color then you're swapping between too easily betwe- reflectance and disposition and you know th- it's up in the air what the word red means what sh- part of the world it carves. that's why i wanna stick w- part of why i wanted to stick with shape talk. um and and yeah yeah absolutely i mean these two words to mean the same thing in the two claims. so you know there's another word i mean if i'm gay then you know there's some- if i'm if i'm i'm sorry if i'm heterosexual then there's something you know straight about me but that's just a pun right? and in the same way some kind of phenomenal straightness or whatever you wanna say is also just a pun... well pa- pa- part of what makes it makes it hard to to say that there's something straight is that is that straight it's it's it's, it's a boundary to some area uh uh so you (measure) black and white with a straight sort of line between so you go from from one to the next or y- you can imagine sort of a black line in a white space uh uh those those kinds of things. uh uh, but if you try to have straight just by itself i mean it have to has_ you have to ha- have some width to the line to be able to imagine it so it's... that's alright but, uhuh  yeah when i when i have_ when i when i imagine_ close my eyes and imagine a black line uh with some red to it okay? the entire but did you mean th- th- that it captures or you want it to capture in any way, the phenomenal? no no no no right so  yeah yeah. yeah yeah. if you could, w- w- rewind just a couple sentences? okay    no no no that's not that's not it? that's not that's not a problem. any thing is a thing. no now you're really reaching cuz it_ see the the the okay if a if if if if a mental picture or a m- mental image is a thing   okay when i close my eyes uhuh  uhuh you create an object which is a mental, picture. you create  and now tell me_ now what more can you tell me about this mental picture. like can you tell me where it is? can you tell me what it's made out of? no it's not it's not a thing in the world it it's a it's now is your mind something in the world or is your mind somewhere else? yeah my mind is in the world. your mind's in the world and th- and this thing is in your mind but this thing is not in the world. no the the the thing the thing the thing is in the world and it's being in my mind but it's it's it_ what one one needs i think one one needs to, uh needs to uh, what i wa- wanna say is that the the mind-slash-brain is able to generate mental images which have a reality to them. which are  physical world? okay okay, mhm you you you are_ okay so when you say the word w- when you say the word world, or when you say the word thing or something you tell me if you are meaning just whatever you're meaning by the physical world or physical thing. um or say explicitly physical world physical thing. okay and now, i got_ i kinda understand you to be saying, see before you want to say the mental picture, you say sometimes it has a reality to it i don't know how to understand that other than, it exists. uh uh um but if you mean something different, (xx) yeah, yeah. no i wanna say it exists in the world but i wanna say that it's not a physically existent thing namely something that  right right  no   the content of it... includes a straight_ s- something straight yes. the content of it includes something     right right yes. we- literally, uh yes it- it's it is straight. it is straight. okay.  there you wanna know where in terms of the space.  uhuh  right. okay so so that's why in this case they_ because you, it's because you believe they're straight that you believe, the word straight a- correctly applies, okay. so so now Peter we're at this point where you wanna say, uh there's these mental-picture parts, that are straight in the spatial sense, s- th- that is  oh okay alright. uh uh um but now, um analogies are cheap. so you know uh uh there are plenty mental analogues of space are all of them gonna be, susceptible in terms of straight curved and so forth? all_ anything that's analogous in any sense to space? yeah yeah  it's straight it's w- no no  mental space is not some extra-physical space that's not in,  most of it_ i i i'm not offering that either i'm saying w- i would say there could be, there could be multiple spaces that aren't spatially related to one another. that would be fine i can even imagine that. uh uh uh um so so whereas a fold would be at a particular point of place, a- and not elsewhere it would be spatially related to the nonfolded part but, if if what you you_ take your pick you can have it i'll give you this much, if you wanna say there's, that all this is a demonstration from you know from this from the intuit- from introspection that you know there must be a uh an extra, realm of, space that's, if if if this is the way you wanna go not, neither here nor there, yeah it s- seems that you you're  oh i no i don't resist the idea that there is this mental analogue i insist that there are just way too many mental analogues you know uh uh um so i mean any three-dimensional if you're talking about three-dimensional space any three-dimensional, mental, any three mental dimensions so you know how much i love someone how much how how how uh how confident i am in their in in in their, you know in their reliability you know how how much i think they owe me you know will be analogous to physical space. not very analogous.   because i don't wanna create some sort of mystery space there that's off in some then then then then, do you wa- but you do wanna create straightness there and not  yeah   i understand that that's why you're complaining bu- bu- that that's, that that's why you're complaining but that complaint is really misplaced because i wasn't at this state of the argument, trying to say, if you have and in fact i don't believe, that i would that if this is true, there is consciousness. i'm i- i- i- i wasn't trying to say that all i was trying to establish was we have a certain illusion. and it seems that you could grant that. uh uh uh cuz i'm not saying you know, consciousness is an illusion yeah yeah yeah no i know you're_ what you wanna a- ad- add some stuff by you know the the the the paper we were looking at last time the add enough things into it then none of the parts have any phenomenal character when you put 'em all together right uhuh uhuh uhuh okay you're objecting to uh   it's alright i just have  go ahead oh   thanks yeah just yeah   okay okay see ya right uhhh um okay i offered to give you the last word... no well    well, right   yeah i think that that's you know uh uh what are you holding out for?  it's bizarre for me to be reaching for some physical th- phy- physical uh uh line in my head yeah and i'd i would say it's bizarre to be claiming to (be) reaching for something straight or n- almost straight,  in your sou- yeah in your soul but i'm not gonna say soul, it could make myself into a dualism but in my experience. in your mind yeah. in my mind. and you_ but you want there to be s- i mean you would like it you'd be happy  if if if i can be given if i can be given a uh uh an account of it, in nonphenomenal terms s- sort of the the the     namely? the, the, the character of my experience was, uh now characters can be straight. character_ wh- not the character in a personal sense like the was the experience straight? you've only told me it's a_ you've t- there's a page there's a mark on the page there's you there's an experience. you haven't  your experience had a straight part? right.   uhuh wow in a conscious way. more and more bizarre. yeah yeah my experience has a m- m- my my experience poof.    right right yeah yeah yeah the the strange thing about to say the experience is straight is usually when we talk about the experience we've stepped back from it, and we're talking uh sort of uh uh secondhand about uh, uh something that's going on in someone else's mind. and there   this part of the experience l- l- n- i i don't understand quite part of exp- what that means you'd hafta tell me but, one guess is i- sometimes i have complex experiences and i have experiences as parts of those complex experiences so i i experienced the Gulf War, part of it was experiencing you know landing in Kuwait or  uhuh so can we just dispense with, shouldn't we just talk about the visual field? you said your visual field part of your visual field was straight? is that better you'd rather go that way? pa- i wanna say part of the the the content_ well it's not m- my my visual field, cuz when i'm having an experience i'm not having a a_ i mean there is there is this sense in which it is like the the visual field i'm looking at the piece of paper i don't have uh imagine a three-hundred-sixty degree uh, uh so that there there there're constraints, put on it you you you're telling my part of an experience is straight. you liken that to something i (am) equally befuddled by yeah i a line. either a line or how- yeah well no, there it's it's analogous to the kind of characteristics of when something uh uh looking something in a salient and it and it and it's and it's far away. uh   that my mind could extend? uh i d- i d- why you would find that silly but not the earlier stuff silly i i haven't yeah it's because it's because whenever i think of the spatial characteristics of of my uh uh of my, uh image, it's not_ there's not literal uh uh spatial in the images it's not it's not but straightness is a literal spatial property, what are you saying? i'm saying that the experience that i have uh when i'm imagining is the same experience i have when i'm looking at the line on the the piece of paper and that the uh, i'm enough of a physicalist to think that what's taking place is really taking place in my brain and that somehow i project, and through some projection have this this, this sense that the line is out there when i'm looking at the line on the piece of paper. but you're not enough of a physicalist to, to conc- you're let- you let beliefs you have about the brain, talk you out of the idea that if you've ever (were attended) to it, that part of your experience is far away. but you don't let facts_ beliefs you have about the brain, talk you out of the idea that part of experience is say straight. or purple. or, polka-dotted or whatever. but you make this decision. that the brain is equally_ i- the brain is as un-polka-dotted and as unstraight as it is un-far-away. yeah, right. well their not right if that's what's at the root of all this then i, really suggest you, consider uh trying to find a way to believe in qualia without believing that straightness has to be a (qualae.) that's a good challenge to end on i think. alright, alright... yeah yeah i mean i believe in qualia but i think they are features other than, distance away straightness reflectance and so forth they're just some other features. uh, uh, okay. whoo.  yeah mhm    well it's not c- cr- (xx) not only logic there's also the empirical, bad luck that there's nothing straight in the brain. you coulda lucked out. eh if there were straight things in my brain that wouldn't help me.  yeah so it's, it's (just) mysterious why that would be at all tempting to, to go that way. when i think about what actually goes on in my brain i- it seems to me that that uh uh, uh it's conceivable we could be recording the information in our brain in zeros and ones or (xx) not really but,  mhm  uh i have to- t- represents is w- we'll wrestle  yeah yeah yeah you want something in-between representing straightness and having straightness. yeah actually i'm i- enough of of what Searle says about information and ref- re- referring, uh that i'm not sure something really ref- one thing refers to another, um uh without there being some, uh referring for a subject or bringing in in in the 	1
LES215MU056.json	um, i'm gonna go ahead and put the verb for, the quiz on the board when you're finished with your vocab quiz, would you, turn to the required readings (and for your_ her quiz_ ) required readings in lesson sixteen and, take out any kernel and modifier charts you might have had for those, from yesterday i wanna go through the, forms (apparently) that's an extra one... oh thanks, (Zack) isn't (xx) okay, um... we're gonna go through these required readings, and then we're gonna work on the narrative reading from lesson sixteen, about the golden apple but, the theme for the day is, to think about, first of all mhm, mhm... how far into the sentence do you go before you see a dative word? first word. okay, (we met)  how so? cuz it's uh, relative pronoun's the first word in the sentence and when it's usually, first word in the sentence then it's gonna function as the (comp, relative to the) (xx) oh okay yeah in in other words if we're at the level of clause, well have we only seen so far instances where,   not without an antecedent. okay in other words it would have to refer back to some word that fell into that category of abstract nouns of helping and hindering, but as a as a relative as a relative pronoun introducing a noun clause, this really can only refer to, mhm mhm there has to be_ the dative is the is the dative object so there has to be another, word a n- noun in the nominative to s- serve as the subject of the sentence. right, but there's an additional, restriction, and that is if you look on page one-sixty-five no. no, okay? i just know i have my subject. how about yes. how does it help you out? because it's a verb on that list. mhm what list? the list of verbs that take, um, dative, case. mhm, dative objects it's on the special intransitive list, so if i recognize um, whom fortune favors has many f- he whom f- fortune favors has many friends. mhm... okay.  mhm, okay and where do you run into the dative noun?  okay, is that enough in and of itself, to tell you anything? no. so i keep reading. RESTRICTED no, so, so even if i can't absolutely pin it down at this point, this isn't a linking verb so i'm not in special linking. it isn't on my special intransitive list so i'm not in special intransitive, so, i can then say even if i can't at this moment, pin down the direct use of this, i know that i have a non-kernel dative, because it doesn't fulfill the criteria for either special intransitive or special linking. so then we move into the w- the four possibilities for the environment of the dative when it is not kernel, on_ starting on page one-sixty-seven. a new clause. mhm, okay, and what about well it's dative again but, we don't know, what it is yet? okay, let's think about what we've experienced and what would be probable in such a circumstance. i have an abstract singular dative, okay i've got a nominative plural noun and i have a form, of the verb gapping. yeah. i probably have a parallel structure which involves gapping, so,     where does the ending, for no, it's first declension. look at the top of page one-sixty-four. oh i know what you're thinking, cuz you're thinking of yeah. yeah. this is an example    well i, handed in my translation already so, trying to remember the many, um, are lacking for neediness. mhm okay, we're almost there. she said the many are lacking for neediness, every, one, is lacking for greed. there's something slightly off about that which is why it sounds a little funny. if you say the many and everyone, are you, reading those (xx) (animate) animate. as animate, sure,  the many things  we could say, instead of everyone, you just  everything is lacking for greed?   mhm, i'm reading along, right? right to left i see subject subject subject. okay, so God or a god is yeah yeah, do i know at this moment_ can i make a decision about what use of the dative case i have? 'm'm no, i don't. i don't know enough except again i can probably rule out, special linking, because the dative is not, one of those yeah. how do i know?  yeah. (um,) gods resist_ i'm not sure what that word means.  so the gods resist the arrogant? mhm mkay  a dative. a dative, okay? i don't, have enough information yet to do anything right? i need more. right.   (no i guess not...) no it's not. nope, so whatever i've got going on here i don't have a special intransitive kernel. is it linking? no. no, i don't have special linking besides the semantics of this again (and i'm not gonna) rule it out. so, i'm in the world of non-kernel datives. at this point can i rule out dative with yes. (yes) (xx) mkay so, it's something else going on what's my next category Tanya? on page dative with verbs meaning give tell show offer? okay, is this a verb meaning give tell show offer?  RESTRICTED mhm, because these are_ you give_   but the gods give, the god gives, um, favor to the humble. mhm, good. John. what's it's a, a clause connector, that conjoins, um it_ no i have a question on, on, number two. mhm if you translate that as, the, the many are lacking_ how did we translate it before? well, Mary started out by saying the many are lacking. the problem, with that, is that, the many in English i think implies animacy. oh the many th- if   mhm it is a dative. it is a dative. it is a dative (but) could you translate that as the poor are lacking many things? um and trans- and  could be  nope that would be genitive  could be nominative plural.  i (still) don't understand like exactly what that translation would even mean, like, is that, the sense o- of for is that because of like many things are lacking because of me that it  yeah  RESTRICTED mhm, okay where do you hit where do you hit the dative word? RESTRICTED yeah. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED special linking, yeah, okay. now, when you get the verb RESTRICTED yeah, this verb is not, one of those, so then now we're going through, again our list on page one-sixty-seven, i don't have dative with RESTRICTED no, okay. uh, third possible, specific category is it a compound verb? no. and on top of page one-sixty-eight there are certain_ there are datives that pattern with a certain set of adjectives, but i don't have any adjectives in this sentence, so, it's not that. so then i'm in, the default mode... which is, on the top of page, um, actually the bottom of page one-sixty-six. second paragraph under non-kernel occurrences. RESTRICTED are you saying those are the two most common, always?   RESTRICTED mhm so what do i expect? RESTRICTED good, okay, and how far do i read, before i see, that, transitive active verb? RESTRICTED not quite all the way to the end. RESTRICTED yeah, okay cuz it's the infinitive that's gonna govern kernel type. so, i now know Hercules... was able to bring back, ought to bring back, um didn't want to bring back i need some sort of verb to govern the infinitive but i know what the syntactic and semantic relationship is between Hercules and these golden apples. and then when i get RESTRICTED it's indicative well let's back it up once, if i see RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  special  special linking, and intransitive intransitive active, right where you're just talking about existence. so, i_ at this point if i have intransitive active, i'd expect no other parts. okay, nothing else. if i have linking, what do i ex- what is my expectation? subject RESTRICTED yeah which is going_ what's that gonna look like? noun  noun in the nominative, or possibly, what other part of speech can i have? adjective.   RESTRICTED dative dative a dative, what? dative  (comp) object. a dative noun... but it's not any dative noun, right? what i- what is inanimate dative  pardon? inanimate animate inanimate, non-animate dative noun abstract abstract, what kind of range of meaning do these things have? they're very restrictive. (help or hinderance) helping or hindering right these are the the, the danger, the aid, the impediment, the safety, that kind of thing, so it's an in this sentence um, couldn't it be, like, technically the other way around where like the, it could be, but, usually what you've got at the beginning of a sentence, okay RESTRICTED yeah because i have another item here okay. now, this could that could be a nominative plural noun, but it could also be a dative, so then i wanna check the meaning, to see whether, it fulfils this meaning criteria. does it? RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED mhm so what does it mean, just that much of it? RESTRICTED yeah, were nymphs, RESTRICTED what if it was a, helping verb, of like advantage or disadvantage? how do you determine between then whether it's linking, or, special, intransitive? ah because you already know that this is not a special intransitive  intransitive active?   say it was_ met the criteria for special linking, right ah, it's gonna be special linking. that'll take a verb? yeah yeah, that'll regularly, um, pattern like that. it's only going to be a problem really if you're dealing with, first, um, declension nouns, because that's the only declension where the dative and the nominative are ambiguous. in every other instance you're not gonna have (a_ the) problem. but yeah no i would make spec- if it if it fills that criterion, if it's abstract, it's not likely to be plural so, okay, good. um, well thank you very much. i think we're done, and thanks for, allowing this to be videotaped, this project thanks you. um, assignment for Monday, we're moving on to lesson seventeen which is the genitive case it's pretty easy, um, it resembles structure in English, almost exactly, and we have no quiz on Monday, so, have a nice weekend a good holiday. before you guys take off i need to (just_ it) takes about twenty seconds to fill this thing out. (you can have) a bunch of old ones. can_ like this is the homework  you  okay, yeah if anybody wants me to look at_ if you wrote out your stuff on the, uh, golden apples thing and you wa- you'd like me to take a look at it just hand it in. is there anybody who hasn't given me a consent form back? okay. 	1

Judy here Emily here Jim here Jean here Morgan here Usha here Armina here Randy an agenda here agen- Annie yeah an agenda where's Jerry? he was here oh no okay, um, approval, of the agenda why don't you guys take a second to look over   okay i noticed that i know i know i know okay are there  can i add um, something about the SEED project? would that go und- it's like a, two-liner yes so under new business? how long can you guys stay Jean? do you want us to move you up? take your time okay everyone have one? okay under point um, s- faaa, sixteen, C will be the SEED project does anyone have any objections to that? they're at the bottom it's old business cuz we've already talked about it in new business (we can always move 'em up already) okay, is there a motion to approve the agenda? i'm_ i move okay is there a   oh, okay well, we'll approve last, well, tech- um motion to approve last week's minutes yeah last week's minutes rock let's wait okay   okay so we have two minutes to approve, next time. um  actually we're not, L-S-and-A student government we're um, nursing seniors okay and, we have actually no part in L-S-and-A but we have to do a, paper on, um how groups, interact and stuff so, we picked you guys. so we're guinea pigs for two things wow okay we're the coolest do you wanna introduce yourself right nex- what um,  okay  hi guys my name's Sandeep, Sandeep thank you for the positive feedback. it's always good to hear positive feedback. John hi, um, i'm John Epstein i'm the uh chair of communications for M-S-A, um, turn really quick to the back, of the, agenda that you just got, um, i'm really proud of this this is a, historic, moment. this is, um, as far as our records, indicate, this is the first, resolution presented to the L-S-and-A student government, on behalf of the Michigan Student Assembly committee. um, so that's, i'm i'm proud of that i think that's pretty cool. um, the resolution is, uh as you can probably tell by its title, uh to sponsor a petition to improve the C-C-R-B. M-S-A took this on, um, couple weeks ago and, uh Matt spoke to you about it last week and told you that we were gonna be doing this and told you that, we were_ that that um, that we were taking the C-C-R-B on that we wanted to improve it, this is the actual formal support. um, we'd like you guys to do this tonight. reason being, we have a meeting on Thursday with the director of the C-C-R-B. if we can take this resolution to him, and say look, students support it we have, five hundred signatures on petitions we have a resolution unanimously passed by M-S-A, we have a resolution passed by the L-S-and-A student government, um, and then just go down the list and and show him, and show the administration that students think this is a big deal, they will listen to us they will, do the improvements and things'll get done. um, now i understand that you guys have a first and second reads process, so do we. and i don't wanna violate that process, i think it's i think first and second reads are important, um, if you can pass this tonight, cool, great. it's more important that it gets passed overall. um, this meeting on Thursday is not going to be the last meeting, regarding improvements of the C-C-R-B next week, we're gonna start meeting with the provost we're gonna start meeting with the, vice-president for uh student affairs, and those meetings are to be honest more important than the meeting on Thursday. if you pass this next week, it will still be extremely useful to the improvement effort, if you pass it this week, it'll be even more useful, but, i don't want you guys to um, uh, split any hairs about it i don't want, um, i don't want it to be a major debate, it's more important that this gets passed in general than that it gets passed tonight. but if it does get passed tonight, great. um, Matt Hackworth is the sponsor and, uh, for L-S-and-A S-G and i assume he'll be talking about it a little bit, um, when you guys get to it. we have to leave now to make the M-S-A meeting but, are there any questions? or or comments about, the resolution or about, uh anything that M-S-A's doing right now? alright  yeah   thank you for coming   um, are there any, other, constituents that would like to speak at this time? seeing none, um, guest speaker we have no guest speaker this week but i do wanna announce that we do have a guest speaker next week, so the meeting will run a little bit longer, the b- guest speaker his name's Mike McPher- Mike, McPher... Mi- and so he'll be coming about seven-thirty and we'll be having a discussion with him in the beginning. um, appointments committee, nominations. Usha are there any? there is none, okay. budget committee recommendations. um. on the back, um, are the budget committee recommendations why don't you take a, a second just to briefly look it over? (who do i give this to?) Jim i just have question if you could explain to me why the Michigan Journal of Race and Law only got, three hundred out of a thousand? only got three hundred, of a thousand?  yes uh, the first reason that they didn't get, a large majority of the money they asked for is because, they're all law students, and uh, that might seem like absurd at first of a r- sponsoring a, law students kind of journal and, to put on speaker, events but, the fact is a lot of L-S-and-A pre-law students attend them. and they seemed like pretty well-funded and a lot of the money they wanted, was, for, travel, but we weren't gonna fund them for, having their, speakers fly in round-trip, at uh, six hundred dollars a ticket so we, funded them for, printing posters only. and that, three hundred dollars would cover that. okay, are there any other ques- Shilpa? um, i had a question about Encompass, i understand that that's a, it's a multicultural show being put on, um, during, the time of, Diversity Theme Semester, and i was wondering um, i mean i know of of different kinds of funding that Encompass has just because it is Diversity Theme Semester i was wondering, why they were given eight hundred out of a thousand as opposed to, the IASA show a couple weeks ago that was only given two hundred? uh, that's a good question and we like thought about that, for a while and what it comes down to is that, just like, us sponsoring Dance Marathon last year, it was a, it was a, like a take-off of that, it was like the first year you know mhm are there any other questions to Jim? i move to approve the, affirmations okay is there a second? second are there any objections? okay, nice job budget committee. it seems to be running smoothly.  um, are there any Ac? Ac is Academic Affairs, Committee resolutions? nope? okay, um, executive officer reports. hm... last we- uh, last week, um the visiting committee, of L-S-and-A came and, i decided i'm, i was invited to speak in front of them and i just wanted to let you know what the visiting committee was, the visiting committee is a group of very influential donors from L-S-and-A, people who donate, um millions and millions of dollars um some, person donated the the Gail Morris Sweetland Center Mr Sweetland was there himself, um the C-E-O of, Pagenet Motorola, Activision, the people with a lot of money, who give a lot of money to L-S-and-A. so they came on Thursday and they spent three days with, um the dean, and various other people in the dean's office. um, i made a presentation, not about student government but about the dean's search committee in the morning, and then i made another diversity, presentation in the afternoon and i got to spend, um, time, i i spent a lot of time with them and it looks like they're really interested in getting student involvement. and, what i arranged for next year, hopefully is that, student government members will be able to take around, um, the visiting committee members, for a whole day, um before they actually come. so that's something you guys can look forward to next year is um meeting these really influential people, and, get- hopefully giving them t- letting them give us a lot of money, so, if you have any questions about that, um, let me know, and i'll answer 'em later. i just wanted to kinda let you know what the V-C was. other than that um, i have no report. that's bad that's fine   (that means you're happy) your turn me? okay, first thing was given to me today by uh, M-S-A, it's a project they're working on, um, in regards to the Code, the Student Code, it's a real nice packet what it does is it details, what's going on to other schools, what we have, and, the, review process that's going on right now. i'm gonna leave this in the office, um, so you can look at it, um, they haven't really asked for anything from us necessarily, they're just trying to, they're starting up kind of like a grassroots um... i don't kn- discussion on this there's already some other stuff going on and this is kind of like, all of it in the same folder so you can kinda get an idea if you're interested so this'll be in the office, um, if you're here and you don't have access to the office talk to me and we'll work out something if if you want, to start getting in there to get to this information, um, the other thing uh, i went to for, i went to um the office-space allocation meeting today at six-thirty, um, we're just going through the process of, setting up that office and everything i wanna make that, a resource that you can use, for, for more than just studying so that you can, you can get stuff done if you want, there, if there's nothing, if th- if there's something, that should be there that's not there let me know so i can get it, um, i'm still working on getting a stapler, but just other stuff that you think could be improved, let me know so i can make that better for you, okay? thank you just a, quick piggyback off the Code stuff. this, how many of you would like a presentation on the Code? like we can call someone to make a really quick presentation   um, let's see. um, let's see elections are, well election packets are due this week, so. if you're interested in running, just talk to one of the executive officers, um, maybe me, um, besides that, nothing much is going on i forwarded a lot of emails tonight so, a lot of things are going on campus if you're interested, just um, um gimme a holler and we can go together or something okay do you have the buddies already assigned to everyone? yeah nice job with that, Rob. um, Secretary, Matt Hackworth um, i just wanted to make sure that everybody knows that when you co- go in to do your office hours, um there's a s- there's a sign-in log it is next to the computer in the, um, black file-holding, uh, thing,  okay, Mr Lane  i have no report okay. um... L-S-A Council, um, we're still v- looking but we have a potential candidate, so next week we'll, next week we'll, see what, what happens. um, Academic Relations Officer, Shilpa. um, i just have a few things to say, pretty much everything that i have to say is detailed in the back of the agenda, or, sorry the back of the first page of the agenda, um, the Academic the next Academic Affairs meeting is Friday at four P-M in the Pond Room, um we have a special guest coming we have Sandy Gregerman coming she's the L-S-A Student Government advisor for those of you who don't know, um she's basically gonna be there to, address any sorts of concerns describe her role a little bit more, what kinds of things she's here, um, to do for us and what kinds of things we need to provide her with, um so that should be, a very, interesting discussion with her, she's a great lady and i'm excited for all of you to meet her who haven't met her yet. um, number two theme semester, funding. um, the reason i, was asking Jim, about the Encompass is because there's um, a special, there's a special um, i guess fund set aside for groups who are programming for, theme semester it's specifically set aside for them, and the way it goes is it's a rolling budget allocation process, and, um, the deadline is December fourth, if you a guys have qu- the deadline for that is um, December fourth but if you have questions, feel free to contact me it's, basically first come first served so if you have an idea like, Diversity Days if, they wanted to, apply or something like that for funding then it'd be a, good idea to do so um, focus groups, focus groups are rolling around really well um, this week, um, i'm waiting for, Bob Owen to get back to me because he is actually gonna be_ he's the Associate Dean for, um Undergraduate Edic- Undergraduate Education in the College of L-S-and-A, and he is interested in meeting with our focus group, um, our major-minor focus group and so, um, if you're interested in that um please contact me, or, Morgan, or, anybody else in the majors-mi- who else is on the major-minors, committee?

Beth um, first of all thank you to everybody who came to Knitwits on Sunday, we, in and out had about sixteen people, and it was good, and we made, over twenty pairs of mittens, and a couple hats, so, it was, good project, um the fourth-floor block party, it's still here i know it's been on the agenda, all year, but it is one week from Thursday, November fifth at, six forty-five in Wolverine, A-B-C, and so hopefully, some of you can make it, and you can get the word out to, anybody that's in a student group, on the fourth floor we're going to be doing some publicity, um, this week Friday Monday Wednesday, so, that should be good, um, last week we set up a fourth-floor email group, and it has all the, email contacts of the people who currently, effective this week, have office space on the fourth floor, and it's, um, people have been using it and it's good, so right now um, the only L-S-A S-G people that are on it, are, the JAC_ the Joint Activities Committee people_ so if you're interested in being on the email group, just send, an email to C, Obalt, and, just ask her to put you on, and that's C, O B A L T, um, we did a little brainstorming yesterday, at our meeting about possible activities, and, we're looking into doing um, like a semiformal sort of mingler ball dance whatever public activities okay, the um red-ribbon drive for drug awareness is, this Thursday, in the Diag, between eleven and, to two or whenever we run out of ribbons. um, so far we probably, have about, mm, twenty-five hundred ribbons somewhere around there we're about halfway there so we still need a lot of help and we're having a meeting tomorrow night at eight o'clock, in the Tap Room which is in the_ eight-thirty_ which is in the Tap Room of the Union, and we're gonna pass a sign-up sheet, for you all to um sign up to come to the meeting tomorrow night, we're gonna be putting, just, a bunch of ribbons together and also sticking, the cards that we're gonna make up, um with hotline information numbers, um, together with the pin, and we're also gonna be sending around a sheet to help distribute the ribbons on Thursday, um like i said we're gonna be distributing um between eleven and two we'll send out a sign-up sheet around, um we want as many people as possible to help us distribute the ribbons not just because we have a lot of ribbons but the more people we have distributing them ribbons, the more, attention we draw to ourselves and therefore our cause. so we'll send around the r-  eleven to about two or whenever we run out of ribbons... oh and also um, our meeting this week has been cancelled so, you can scratch that off, okay, no meeting this week. that's it um, is Mr Caster here? no Randy's not here? no okay. um publications Lena? um, i met with, Annie, who's the editor-in-chief of the Daily and, the result is basically that um, they can't do a special section because of, the rules that they have in terms of, d- what Daily writers can write and what, outside groups can write and how that can be put into the paper, but what we're thinking about_ i'm thinking about doing um and i'll give you guys a proposal about it in a week or so, is, coming up with our own section but getting it inserted in the Daily that would be the same size as the weekend editions, you know those (filler) sections th- we could do 'em on the newsprint in the same way. um, and so i'm, i'm contacting the business managers and the people that deal with that kind of stuff at the Daily right now, to see about how much it would cost and i'm also, talking to people from M-S-A, um, to see how we can coordinate d- this together with other students groups. so um, student governments. so i should be able to get back with you in like, by next week hopefully um, with some more details on that. that's good. um, elections of officers or chairs, um, we don't really have elections, but i did wanna, mention the new election director at this time, um, it is gonna be Beth Wiegand, um, uh so, she'll, she's not running in the election so she, will no- have no conflict of interest, and, that's it so if you have any questions and you're running, she is the person to go to. even though she doesn't know very much what she's gonna do right now. do you?  no but, okay it'll al- all come to her starting tomorrow okay. there's no amendments to the constitution or bylaws, um, so we're gonna go to old business point A, which is a special allocation proposal, and i'm gonna hand this over to Tom okay. so if you look on the back of, the very end of, the uh, agenda, titled, special allocations proposal, i, reworded it based on the suggestions i was given, um, and i went with the approach that, has people that ask for more than a thousand dollars, has them go through the budget allocations, committee, and then they come up with a recommendation, for the next meeting, or whenever they get around to it, hopefully at the next meeting, for us to d- start with, and then talk about the decision so, let's say Dance Marathon came, they would come, and they would be directed to the budget allocations committee. the Budget Allocations Committee would have them fill out a, budget allocation form, you know, what, expenses they have and that, information. they would hold an interview if they need to, but they don't have to, and then at the next week's meeting, the Budget Allocations Committee would come and say, we recommend that we give them, fifteen hundred dollars for Dance Marathon. and they would be here to talk if th- if Dance Marathon needed to talk to, to add to to our discussion and answer questions. it's, it's basically what we've done before except it has them go, through the budget allocations committee and give us, give us more information t- to decide on. um, hopefully that'll, that'll st- streamline the, the, discussion of what we should give 'em, so it, it feels less ar- arbitrary, and we, can go into it better, informed and also we, involve Budget Allocations Committee in this way. um, it's not in resolution form, because this isn't a resolution. um, this is, i i put this up so that we can, vote, to f- to support this process, this internal process, so that when a group comes we kind of know what to do when they come, so we don't, just, you know, discuss and talk about the allocation that day. um, we don't have to vote this on, but i think if we, if we, modify this tweak it and then, go by it, we'll know what to do when a group comes. um, i don't think i'd, i, oh also i removed from the last resolution or the r- last proposal, i removed the part that said we will suspend parliamentary procedure for five minutes, um, just because, well you can't really put that in a resolution, if we're gonna do that we have to say, let's suspend parliamentary procedure, um, actually we talked about it at (steering,) we don't really need to, to get rid of parliamentary procedure we can have a speakers list, i just think if we had more discussion on, what we might wanna give them before we make a resolution, we'll avoid that problem, that we run into when, you know, right in the beginning of the conversation someone says i move we give 'em five hundred dollars and then we talk about, amendments and, and you know voting to, call the amendments and so on and so on and so, i, i think we can streamline this um, i throw this up, for support um, i guess we should have, uh, discussion, and then, for support, or a vote, what do you do? just a vote of support. so um, it's just a, it's a, we'll vote, if they support it okay it's not very hard okay, so then,  Jean? i like it i think it'll make it a lot more efficient and then, we'll actually, like, they're really competent so then we'll, kinda know, what we're voting on and why Tom, there's okay there's a typo. just so you know okay there any other, points of discussion? on this? if not, then we'll just go directly to like  i have a question real quick shoot  yes more than a thousand okay, um, it would go to the Budget Allocations Committee, and, if they determined that, there's no reason that this could p- couldn've gone through through the process of th- actually no that's not true because all, al- allocations greater than a thousand come to us, right mhm  no.   okay just, just so you guys know this is not like something that we're advertising, it's something for us to implicitly kind of agree on so when a person comes from the outside and asks for money, this is w- the what we're gonna follow. so it's not like we're gonna advertise people coming, to usurp the, budget allocations (mhm) okay um let's go ahead and just take a  question? sorry, any other points of discussion? question? um and, Lena pointed out a, typo. it's point six uh, last clause the entire, L-S-A S-G assemble, assembly not the okay. um, let's take a vote of support all in favor of this, um, proposal, raise your hand  yeah. um, if you guys remember it's just um, basically this is gonna be a discussion, on, where we're giving_ which type of substance abuse program we are donating our, charitable donation to. um, i did a little bit of, research um, and i found, see i kind of added to Beth's research that she had done a couple weeks ago. um, and, i've narrowed it down to uh at least in my opinion, um, to three different organizations that we could could possibly, give our money to um, and they're, they're each of them differ, in, they... they differ in a few ways which are pretty important to, to just talk about right now so i'm basically gonna describe the three different organizations and then, open it up to discussion, um which will be followed by, a vote does anyone have any qu- mm. Lena i was just wondering um, you said that the Washtenaw Council one was funded by the state, so is there a need for funding? like what would our money go towards? what um    um i was just gonna say quickly that when i went, to, Project Serve Anita Bone who is the, head of all of Serve, um, we talked about Dawn's Farm a lot and i really like that one too because, i just thought you guys, it would be important to know that she knows the director personally and she knows that they go, yearly from like that budget to the next budget so th- it's a very tight thing and, and our money unlike if we, gave it to the Washtenaw Council, you can tell which one i'm for,  Matt do you officially recommend the first one the farm one? um, can i move then to, to just go ahead and, and give th- and give the donation to that one, or should we yep   what? move to vote?   two  second are there any objections? to giving the money to th- okay can i, give this sheet, um yeah i guess we form a speaker's list, we've already heard why it's a good idea to give it, um, Matt do you wanna, speak against it? i, sure. speak okay, um, i just wanted to ask one question that i didn't, get to have answered before, Mr Richards made the, motion so i wanted to get an opportunity to ask that question and that would be, in the course of your investigation did you find any groups that were geared toward, heroin and cocaine abuse versus... alcohol abuse? no i didn't. but i i wasn't paying attention to that specifically so, i was paying more attention to the s- to s- general substance abuse programs so i can't say, which groups, do have more focus on heroin and... so, i guess my investigation wasn't as complete. (i would say that) okay. um anyone   huh? i move previous question okay i second someone called a vote? okay, it's first second second i nee- okay, all in favor of,  no we have to vote mhm okay     okay, um, what we are is removing the two hundred dollars that we've previously allocated, to, Dawn, Farms, Treatment Center? is that it?   okay, all in favor...? all opposed...? all abstain? okay.   mainly Shilpa (mainly) but you're welcome anyway. if you could get that information to Mr Lane yeah so he can, make a along with meeting (for) Mr Richards yes... okay, we'll go to new business C C oh i'm sorry, sorry j- Armina, point C SEED um, Janine emailed me, um, she wanted to know if we wanted to do another, boating simulation in another school. and i don't think i can do it, so, if anyone else is interested  when are they look like, she  soon? i mean soon okay... um, new business um, Student Mediation Services is not here, and they're coming two weeks from now, um so we'll go down to point B which is, um_ the U-of-M, for Life resolution, and, Jerry, so this w- you can speak to it? okay, um, these are, this is the resolution like here that i wrote up, um, and this is the general information sheet that i'm gonna pass out, i only made like i think fifteen copies of each so you may not get one of both. but um, basically, um, what this is, is you guys have heard me talk about it before, um, it's an event that's gonna happen on Palmer Field the C-C-R-B, and a coffee shop, that's gonna take place August tenth, of, this Winter Term, and the focus, is to, raise money for the National Childhood Cancer Foundation, which is a nonprofit, um, organization that um, has various um, supports various research institutes, and treatment centers, in the United States, such as, um, U-of-M's own Mott's Hospital, um one at University of Chicago, one at North Carolina, U-N-C Chapel Hill and so forth like that, and um, basically the student group Focus for the Future, is im- is implementing they're the host, and as, um, a representative or a liaison, for that student group, um i wanted to get um L-S-and-A Student Government's support, and just simply endorsing the event, and supporting its purpose, and, pretty much how we're gonna raise the money, is through, sponsorship and um, student, just regular students who wanna donate, any money, the information sheet that i handed out has been changed, a little bit, because, um, it's on a voluntary, donation basis so, five to ten dollars, isn't really five to ten dollars, it's just, whatever you can give the suggested, um, donation was three dollars, and, there also is a coffee shop, and, we're just trying to make it as fun as possible so, it's gonna be really good too. it's gonna be, it's coming along really well, and, we just wanted to get your support. and straying from the typical, let's just pass this over for first reads and discuss on second reads we're actually gonna discuss at this time, so we can kind of streamline it for next time. so if you guys have any questions, um, ask Jerry now. hm? Matt um, i have a question. on the, um, agenda it says U-of-M for Life is that okay. the the name, of the, of the student group is Focus for the Future. okay uhuh okay.    nah, no no no mhm that was my mistake oh, okay sorry Usha? so, exactly, like, what, would L-S-and-A do? we just endorse it?  i just have a quick question um, if you, look at the resolution, um, the second point says  okay well, basically, what we're, the reason why i said build the community of Ann Arbor it's because our sponsorships, we're looking for both like local and somewhat national, like, our, right now, our main, um, sponsorships we're, trying to advocate for, are like let's say Pizza House, uh, like Cava Java like what-have-you, things just in the Ann Arbor that everybody knows like where Pizza House is and so forth like that. We're also trying to get like national sponsors such as like, like a K-Mart or like a Meijer or something like that cuz, the the main point is to raise as much money as we can, and like we have nothing to lose by asking like, K-Mart for money if they wanna donate it, he's trying to support the Ann Arbor community um, those of you, oh. sorry. i just noticed on, this, this sheet,  yeah, well well that, that's just the informational like that's been changed like, i just when i was using, like, when i was printing it out, like i was kind of like setting it, i didn- and i lost track of time so i didn't print out the other one that i revised, just to be honest n-  well i was just wondering because, like our name's there, but we hadn't, officially,  this is just something real quick and picky but, could you possibly take the first, whereas, and break it up into like two sentences or something like that, cuz it's all,   okay.  go ahead no go ahead um well i just, i wanted to kinda, like, i just wanted to get the main point across and like, i can split it up and like, add commas however you would like, Matt. i just want a look okay  yeah. su- uh not a better form but like um, mm, yeah okay is that  Rob? yeah can i make a motion for a straw vote of support? a straw vote of support?     mhm (oy)   okay um, Matt Hackworth and the C-C-R-B resolution. uh okay. um, oh. um, it's the resolution that, um John Epstein was talking about on the back of your, um, the back of your agendas.  to waive first reads and pass it, today. um, can i get an, informal opinion on how many people, find that okay and how many people, are, against that, before, cuz uh as John said like if there's a lot of, um, dissension, about, doing that, we can, we can just not worry about it, but uh c- can i make a comment? yeah okay, i would, i would s- not necessarily for the resolution but i would probably, vote not to, bypass first reads because i think first reads are important because usually that's the first time anybody's seen anything, but because, this isn't such a, life sh- changing, resolution,  okay. let's just take an informal vote of how many people, um, just kind of out of, parli pro whatever it doesn't matter, take an informal vote of, how many people would be willing to bypass first reads? how many people would be opposed? okay, it looks like Matt you're gonna get a lot of dissension on that. okay. so we'll just go ahead and uh look ov- look it over and, um, if you have any, any changes that you wanna make come to me and we can, um go ahead and, discuss at the passage next week then does anyone have any questions about the content and not necessarily the wording? Matt. oh. cuz like the wording can be fixed, outside of, the government time, unless it's gonna, infringe, too much on um, i have to, just because, just before he was leaving he um, told me that he wanted to change, the second-to-last paragraph okay um, because there was already some, talk about us, not wanting to actively encourage the administration on this. um, so, he suggested this wording change and i wrote it down and i'll, say it now.  okay. okay, those were word changes by, the actual people who, submitted the resolution, so, um any other, word changes, um, if you wanna see Matt Hackworth afterwards or email him, or um, Robert, from, M-S-A i can't pronounce his last name so i'm not point of,  didn't we, um Matt on the basis of that point i wanna move to suspend the rules and consider this for passage  um, i'll s-  i wasn't, i wasn't sure all in favor of suspending the rules? oh (told you) because it's irrelevant      dilatory? he asked me to do it. so at this point um, we're gonna, we're gonna g- um, does anyone have any, discussion, questions that they wanna ask Matt, right now? if not then we're gonna s- we're gonna just gonna do it for next,  yep. okay. it's not tabled, it's um, moved to second reads for next time. oh okay difference between tabling and the but we tabled the discussion didn't we? yeah we didn't? whatever yeah parli pro   okay um, parliamentary procedure. sure um, in response to, to what's been happening in the last few, meetings and in response to some, comments that have been heard, from constituents and representatives both, i'm gonna pass around this, little informational sheet which is something like the one that uh Mr Randall gave us earlier in the year, what it is basically is a primer, for the discussion that will hopefully be ensuing, from our, new council which is supposedly coming down the pipe, um, so i don't wanna step on any toes, and er, take up too much time talking about parliamentary procedure but hopefully everyone'll look this over, um, and, think about it, and, hopefully, when we get a new council they can pass us something that's a little more uh, complete, as far as Robert's Rules go i mean it it is a whole book, so i don't think we're gonna get a, copy of the book for each of us, but um, if we all become more familiar with the, types of motions the types of main motions that are allowed, and the order in which things are considered, then things'll, in my opinion run much more efficiently and much more quickly than, they are when, people are, kind of, uh, sounding off about their personal feelings on an issue, in, successive order not relating to any particular point and not addressing any previous arguments. so, um, a couple things i'd like to, call attention to, is uh specifically this first, point here, is something that, people seem to be having a lot, not ev- if, i shouldn't say that people are having a lot of trouble with but it's a very important point that... matters of, a lower rank, are considered first in other words, the most... l- the lowest order of amendment is considered first the example given here is, the amendment the amendment, must be disposed of, before, the amendment, can be voted on, and the amendment must be disposed of before the motion can be voted on. that, that's a pretty important point and, lots of time we get off track talking about, the motion when we're supposed to be talking about the amendment. so, in the interest of not stepping on anyone's toes i'm going to end this discussion now. okay. um... in response to some, of what our constituents, have um emailed, both to Tom and i, um, we're gonna try to become um, a more well-informed government on parliamentary procedure, um, when we have, when it's not running, um, effectively, people seem to, be lost and so we're trying to, make this all a more effective, so everyone's, kind of on the same page. and, like anything it's a learning process, i'm not, gonna say that i'm fluent with parli pro cuz that's not even, that's not even close to true, so, um, just, let's use the next couple of meetings, to really practice, um, doing parli pro and when we have a council it'll be a lot better. but, um, just bear with us, and um, we're learning, as you guys are learning too, so one final point in relation to parliamentary procedure if you look on the bottom of the back of the sheet, it says that um, you can utilize, S-A-L services this little sheet was produced by S-A-L so if you wanna go to um, the student leadership people and, go through one of their seminars you can always do that. okay, thank you, um, hopefully we'll try to get an S-A-L person in here, to help us with parli pro too. mhm okay, now i've got another handout to pass around, and um, this one here, this, fun little item, is, a copy of, a proposal that was, presented by the Provost to the regents, that was the impetus, as far as i understand for the thirty-dollar, a person, or an (allocated) student fee, that we were assessed this year, to improve the, information, technology environment of the college, uh, I-T-D, actually has nothing to do with this committee, um, in fact one of the, key issues of the committee is how to, stay away from, I-T-D's, business, and how to, tailor, the money w- that will hopefully be spent on behalf of the students, away from the activities that I-T-D, or the services that I-T-D is providing for, the students because the fear is, if, um, as a college we do anything, to supplement I-T-D's services, they may, pull back from the services they're already providing, so, the autonomy of I-T-D is something of a problem as far as improving the i- technology environment, of the, of the campus but that's a completely separate matter, uh, the name of the committee, incidentally for, for further budget, er for further agenda, purposes, is the L-S-A Informational Technology Committee... um we will be meeting next Monday again with, Mike McPherson and the rest of the committee, Ladizwana and i, and uh we will be discussing some further issues, as far as uh what sort of response the committee has been getting back, from a letter they sent out to all the department chairs. uh the strategy that the committee has been taking to dispose of this one-point-one million dollars, is to write letters to all the committee chairs, and ask them what they, think as far as, how the money could be best spent, and we haven't gotten any response from that yet, uh so obviously the committee is in its, very early stages, next Tuesday we're going to have Mike McPherson here to speak with us, so um, after i, answer Jerry's question i can, talk about some of the main issues. oh, i'm sorry. i, i didn't know you weren't done. go ahead. no please an- ask the question. no i was gonna, i'll wait till you're finished oh okay. um, as far as some of the main issues that are, in front of the committee, some, some questions that we might be able to, tailor for, Mr McPherson who is, being kind enough to come and visit us next Tuesday, um, the key issue is the student labs we have all these student labs in all the departments and some of them, are, fostered through the department, for instance, in the political science department the lab is completely taken care of by the political science department and the college has nothing to do with it, so that's not under our purview, it says here there are currently ten structural computing labs and it lists where they are, and, how much it's cos- costing to, upgrade them on a, three-year cycle so that, that is a big issue in in the, in the committee, if we buy all these wonderful things, how much is it gonna cost to, keep replacing them and keep, uh insuring that they're continually wonderful, uh, okay Jerry uh, my question is this, um, how much, like right now, did you like take a survey or something to see like, cuz i think that one of the things is, w- how many student actually participate in the, like, in the, in the programs, that are sponsored like for PowerPoint and for Excel whatever have you? like how many students like, tend to show up to those? can you take a survey of that, or if you_ do you have general foundation of that? cuz i think, a lot of this would be, based on what is currently happening at the university i know myself, i see i'll see a sign that says, PowerPoint i'm like i know how to use it, i'm not gonna go. and then, that's just me though. maybe other people are like, would be like oh i don't know i'd like to learn, but i think that (xx) the original idea in what the students want cuz, i don't see, what would, would it, (what) would help if you were trying to improve the teaching, if kids, or if students weren't even trying to like, get that learning. right. well, the the whole, the whole, story about Pow- PowerPoint, it should be, teach our teachers, to learn this. is it a powerful enough instructional tool, that we should spend this money to teach our teachers how to use it? or is it, not as powerful a- as an instructional okay um, so it's all a matter of where to spend the money, um, should we spend it on support staff? should we spend it on training the faculty? should we spend it on putting, computers on faculty desks? i would say definitely not, in that last instance i mean, to me that's, really a progression of getting further and further away from, a direct impact on students. and the question is, where is that, edge? where is the, drop-off so to speak as as far as w- when spending becomes, too indirect, to be using our money on it? and i think one thing that we, really should seek to, pin down, Mr McPherson on, is... will the six hundred and sixty thousand dollars that the Provost kicked in, be subject to the same, priority, restrictions, that, the money that is re- drawn from the student thirty-dollar fee is? um, so cuz i think that the administration sees the six hundred and sixty thousand dollar kick in, as, you know, their form of play money that they can, shuffle around in that budget however they want. um, so, well i think we'll have some interesting things to talk to, these people about and, hopefully we'll have some informative questions hopefully you'll take a look at this, and, do some thinking about, what would i- improve the, environment in your classes or you know maybe you can ask some people i, i don't really know what sort of regime you can employ to take a survey, um, in fact i- it's interesting that most students don't even know that they were assessed a thirty-dollar fee, okay, um, as i said, next week um Mike McPherson's coming, um so, i am g- i'm gonna put this in Matt's lap, so if you guys have any questions that you wanna generate, that you wanna ask Tim, um, ahead of time, um, email them to Matt. right and al- and also, Lena and i are meeting, again with the committee on Monday, morning, so we'll have a lot more to say hopefully after Monday and maybe, we can get together and put out some sort of informational email that'll give, you all some ideas of of how the process is moving along and what sort of responses what sort of proposals we're getting so that might be able to, guide your questions a little bit okay. thank you, t- for taking that on. okay. um i guess we go to announcements, um, i guess i have one, really, happy announcement today is uh, Beth's, nineteenth birthday,  thank you    Ru  Ru  does anyone have any other announcements while Shilpa lights the candles?   a couple things. one, there is a, rally that maybe everyone's heard of in

OFC175JU145.json	so that's the frequency of, Q-squared. they wanna know the frequency_ in this problem they wanna know the frequency of all of the genotypes. so, what other, what other um, of these elements do we need to solve for here Emi? if they wanna know the frequency of all the genotypes?   right, two-P-Q, and P-squared. so, what what are we, what piece of information are we missing here in order to solve for say two-P-Q? P P and how would you find P? i don't know. subtract four from ten thousand? well you  take the square root of that      well,    i don't know well we decided how we could find Q right? yeah but it, do the square  because, these aren't the frequency of the genotypes these are the frequency of the alleles. oh. so  well, okay that goes back to um that that uh, what's that law of  mhm half if there's_ yeah s- let's just_ okay so say it's one-half. so the frequency of getting, this allele once and getting the same allele again  quarter no i i oh yeah okay. so the way that you would find two-P-Q and P-squared here we're still missing P we don't know, what P is. the way you would find that is, we found out that Q-squared is equal to four out of ten thousand or,  yep mhm take the square_ oh i'm sorry.    Q that would equal Q. and then you do one minus Q to get P. and then you just square P. so you would take the square root of this number which is, and the s- square root of Q-squared    point-zero-zero-two  uhuh it's point-zero-two it's point-zero-two? yeah so if that's point-zero-two then, um P would equal what? point-nine point-nine-eight point-nine so we will get, yeah okay  um i_ it    sex-linked? um i forgot to turn in my yeah yeah, you can turn it in now.  oh yeah there there could be i mean on the last exam there were a lot, but that was you know that was a different professor so, i mean, i would assume that there was_ there's gonna be at least one. um, but, you know there's different people making it up, this time so, they might have a different style. can i go see if Dr Collin is in his office, real quick? yeah. okay so can we do number seventeen? seventeen? i'm confused (xx) okay, that's a... that's a sex-linked one but uh it's it's sort of a more complicated one, so i i kinda wanna start with a more general sex-linked one first. um, what about thirteen? yeah thirteen okay so let's look at thirteen. thirteen says that a white eye gene in drosophila is sex-linked. so they're saying that the gene for eye color, is sex-linked in these flies. right yeah white white eyes and sec- and that's gonna be recessive... then they say, that a white-eyed female and a red-eyed male are crossed. and they wanna know what are the phenotypes of the offspring gonna be. and then they give you a hint  that means that they'll only have one allele. it might be recessive it might be dominant so they only need one R to be, white? yeah they only need one little-R to be white cuz the only, only the X is gonna have an allele on it not the Y. yeah is that is that gonna be w- that way with all sex-links? they'll specify if it's male. well they're they're gonna tell you    mhm i- right it'll be on the one there's more of that's another way of saying it so  there's sex-linked on Y. like what? there's no_ well there's there's few there's a few um, genes that're on Y like genes that specifically only males have, but in most of the problems you're_ in all of the problems i've ever seen in an intro bio course the sex-linked gene means that it's on_ that the ha- homogametic sex has two copies of it and the heterogametic sex has one. so that would make it really obvious if it weren't in a question? w- just assume that if it says sex-linked, that means that the homogametic sex has two copies and the heterogametic sex has one. okay um little-Rs on both of 'em? little-Rs. and the male is red-eyed, so what am i gonna put an upper case, allele? an upper case R where? on the X on the X, right. so when i set up a Punnett square... and i'll put the male's gametes up here. what are the male's gametes? what what could they potentially have? what should i put up here at the top? a X-Y an X X-R big-R, or he could pass on a Y gamete to make a son. and the female? just two Xs with, recessive Rs. right. so when i cross these i'm going to get... a heterozygous female, so what color what color eyes is this female gonna have? uh red. red. i'm gonna have... another heterozygous female who'll also have red eyes. i will have... the male i can't really say heter- you know homozygous or heterozygous there's only one trait what color eyes is this male gonna have? white white. and then i'm gonna have, the other male is also gonna have white eyes. so the male doesn't pass anything on to the, the son. not_ they don't_ well in this case they don't pass the trait for eye color on, but but all the sex-linked,  um yes yes yes? okay. so, in number seventeen it says that X-X right the genotype of the male... no no they're all barred. all barred what are the_ right everyone's barred. the females are barred and the males because barred is dominant, they're gonna be barred too. so that doesn't work for us. i have a question like, i didn't know that you could just like_ i mean i_ like to switch like the male has the two X-chromosomes. i mean is that just like for these    oh okay.  no i didn't just decide to do that i- it says that birds, in birds this is the way it is. so who can think  you don't have actually_ you don't actually have to like trial and error that much because, no matter what, if, a male is striped, all of 'em are gonna be striped because either way, the male will pass on an X to all of 'em making 'em all striped. uhuh you have to have_ okay so, Christian is basically good at logic here and and, he doesn't have to do a lot of trial and error cuz he's logically working it out in his head. i personally am terrible at logic, so i would have to do a series of trial and error to figure it out. but you're saying and this is what you would find out if you were doing it through trial and error that the male has to be,  X-B, X-big-B. X-big-B, and Y male male and they're all barred or  are we_ i have a question about something else if we're, sure uhuh that is epistasis. that is epista-   right   (right) mkay oh alright does does epistasis make sense to everybody? that just means that one gene can totally influence the expression of another gene it can_ basically it's a gene being dominant over another gene you can think of it  (seventeen)  the parrot one.      um  it's number eighteen. oh it's number nineteen. what proportion, yes it says_ and there's anothe- you know there's the clue it says no matter what. that's a clue that you're talking about apo- epistasis. okay what are the other word- the other clues? um, irregardless of, you know, no matter what irregardless of those are usually clues that you're talking about epistasis. can you explain incomplete penetrance? cuz i didn't um, mhm i could someone else wanna help out? Spencer'll do it i i thi- i don't know he gave a lot of terms a- in, in that part and i have to refresh my memory i think incomplete penetrance was where,  yeah yeah, he gave the example that, um, for like one dominant allele, causes um somebody  right or they have like different numbers of extra fingers. so  alright so it_ alright and why would that happen? you   i have a question about like the, when we were talking about the epistasis  um how does it gonna affect, like the outcome the phenotype, that's produced?  okay well that would probably be best described by just going through one of these epistasis problems so, if you look at um, number nineteen, it says (um) big-K-little-K. 'kay big-K... two little-Ks. right little-K-little-K. so what i'm gonna get is, big-K, little-K... (xx) (yeah)   big-K-little-K-big-M-little-M. little-K-little-K-big-M-little-M. little-K-little-K-big-M-little-M. and then, big-K-little-K-little-M-little-M. big-K-little-K-little-M-little-M. did we get all the   okay so now we have all_ these are the possible genotypes of the offspring. now we need to decide what their phenotypes are gonna be and that's where you need to keep in mind the epistasis that's going on here. because we know, if they have a big-M, they are gonna be deaf even if they have two big-Ks. it doesn't matter they're still gonna be deaf. even though they have the two_ even though they have, a big-K-little-K or a big-K, big-K, which means that they have what's required for hearing, they're still gonna be deaf because they got a big-M. so that's gonna affect what the phenotype of the offspring is gonna be. so let's look at this first one it's got a big-K that's required for hearing, so you would think that it's gonna ha- it's gonna have hearing but, what's the phenotype for the M gene? or for the_ yeah for the M gene? deaf deaf deafness. so, because it says that if it has a big-M it'll be deaf no matter what, that's epistasis. the expression of this gene is overriding the expression of the K gene. and this individual, will be deaf. and to figure out what what proportion of the individuals have this genotype, how would you figure that out? they're all quarters because, they're all halves. right so you have to find out what's the chance that it would be a big-K little-K, well the chance of that is, half and half one-half. mhm okay now wh- what would this individual would they be deaf or not? yeah they would be deaf because they have a big-M here so they're automatically, mhm   they what? they   they're deaf because they don't have the big-K and the big-K is required for hearing. so they're deaf. so the question asks what proportion of the children would be deaf? so you need to figure out what's the proportion f- of each of these genotypes right? (three-fourths) okay  mhm  viral reproduction sure. um isn't that like phage, reproduction though? i don't_ phages reproduce? yeah phages is just like an infecting, agent  okay   okay where would he have used that word? in the lecture about viruses. yeah like what part? um well he talked about how retroviruses in retroviruses that, they have R-N-A for their genetic material. right  reverse transcriptase. and they take that R-N-A they use reverse transcriptase to convert it into D-N-A. so we're going from R-N-A to D-N-A. and normally we don't do that normally we go from D-N-A to R-N-A so you really do need a special enzyme here, that's carried by the virus. so what was that word? do you think we'll have to know it? reverse  the lyso- lysogenic and lytic? yeah. i don't think it's gonna be important. okay.    so would that be the prophage? pro- a pro- pr- a prophage is just um, like something that infects something else. oh so it's so it's just like a generic term  oh this little chart. this diagram. so, a phage D-N-A inserts into the bacterial chromosome becoming a ph- prophage. so in in this case they're saying that you call the inserted D-N-A a prophage. okay but but that's not  yeah it's not gonna be important. does anybody know if the answers to the practice exam are up on the internet yet? i don't know. i didn't even know that they posted them. so does that answer your question? yeah. okay yeah and and the other part of that just shows the other part of that diagram that he's looking at shows the lysoge- or the lytic phase of a cycle, and the lytic phase is just basically when something active is going on. active viral production is going on. so the D-N-A gets transcribed and you start making more viral proteins and the new virus assembles and exits the cell, so that that phage that phase where there's act- active viral production going on, it's not just sitting in the h- in the chromosome dormant there's actually active viral production going on that's called the lytic  go ahead.   so like in the lytic um phage, the D-N-A isn't uh reproduced like, normally it's, the,  it's repro- yeah it's reproduced separately from the cell's D-N-A. okay so, okay that's (xx) yeah yeah i mean it's only called lysogenic when it actually incorporates, when       and then, they can go into the lytic cycle and that's when they separate from the D-N-A and, start reproducing and then burst open. right. yep yeah. i mean o- okay i i wanna i wanna tell you here that i think that your guys' focus is a little bit off okay, you you_ there were a lot of ecological concepts that were brought in and a lot of examples he showed. um you want to be familiar, you want to be able to explain to someone what these ecological concepts are, and you know all these different terms that you got. you wanna be able to explain to someone what do those terms mean? and what what kind of example can i provide, of those types of terms? and you know you need to understand how the example relates to the term and those types of things and there were a lot_ you notice that Hazlett does a lot of examples so, i i i always say focus on lecture and that's what he focuses on so that's what you should focus on.  okay yeah he gave you um sort of different definitions of people's interpretation of, what what a species really is. i mean you can't say, speciation the definition of speciation is the formation of a new species. so, it's really hard to decide if you have the formation of a new species unless you can define what is a species? what is a species? what does that term actually mean? and he gave um, different def- proposed definitions that describe what a different species means. and the most commonly used definition, was the biological species concept that's the one that's usually traditionally taught. and that just means that it's um, it's a group of individuals, so a species is a group of individuals that, can mate together, and produce offspring. so an interbreeding group of individuals. that's what a species is   isn't it they produce fertile offspring? see that's that's th- that's the way that i've traditionally learned      right so that's the way that i've traditionally learned, the that definition of a species that's exactly the way_ normally i point out remember it has  mhm mhm   so mules are infertile? uh m- yeah yeah. i didn't know that.  okay actually i i-  no i i  polyploidy um right. okay, um, so polyploidy just r- refers to, the general situation of you have, too many chromosomes of that type. so polyploidy would be if you have three chromosome twenty-ones instead of two chromosome twenty-ones. okay mhm auto auto. right cuz it's just one situation so, i i i'm thinking that that might have been an example of, sympatric_ i'm thinking_ okay i think he bounced around in the lecture here and that he all of a sudden went back to sympatric speciation and that was an example of sympatric speciation. does that make sense? (xx) if they just   because now there're two populations and if you took the, new, individuals that breed on apple trees and the other individuals you couldn't breed them together. anymore.   no  no well, that that's what i was thinking because the example was there. but something like that would happen. something would have to happen_ because now remember these these apple tree, um they're they're totally in a separate environment they depend on apple trees they're not gonna go back over to the other type of trees. wouldn't peripatric? or, never mind just go ahead, with what you were gonna say. okay um, so the reason why they don't breed together anymore is because they use different resources now. so, these ones aren't interested in breeding with, the flies that mate on another tree because, um they're used to mating on these type of trees and unless another accident happened like the original female that accidentally, breeded in the wrong environment unless another accident happened which would be rare, these fruit flies now all_ they grew up on these trees they're used to these trees that's where they're gonna stay is on the apple trees. so ultimately what could happen, what could happen_ that doesn't mean that if you put them back together again that they couldn't breed just because they like being in different places.    that wouldn't be an example of polyploidy then right? no no i just thought that it was because it it was   wouldn't that be like cladogene- genis- genesis instead of speciation really? or would they be the same,  cladogenesis, cladogenesis is  yeah no but they still have a common ancestor though they have a common ancestor but they don't include all of the organisms a f- and and, a whole clade has to include all of the organisms that have that common ancestor. so what what_ they have a common ancestor it's right here, but it doesn't include all of the organisms it's not a full clade it's not a whole clade why not? what's missing? (xx) by including that point? by including, well if i included that point i still haven't done it because i don't have all of the individuals that, were derived from this common  yeah i have to include,    no i have to include this guy because they came from this branch also. basically you need_ you look for the common ancestor, okay, you just drew_ i don't  this one oh th-  okay. so the common ancestor wouldn't be here it would be where? where your left finger is. it would be here. right. but i haven't included all of the individuals from that, branch point there was another group this group also came from this branch point. uhuh  so if that  go ahead but i- if that group didn't have a similar trait to the other two the other two couldn't make the clade with just the common  um, what was that? there must be a class in here now are you_ is there a class in here? uh there is a class from one to two-thirty in here so okay okay so what time is it? i don't have a watch. it's just about o- a little after one. okay, so that's it we need to wrap it up um, but make sure you go through the notes make sure you understand what the i- how_ what the examples, um refer to will you be emailing this weekend if we have any questions?  um about the,  about what? um, what what's th- what's for? 	1
MTG999ST015.json	(xx) bounced back to me.  right she got it by telepathy not email right? yes yeah. you (xx) yesterday right i know, and that's but but i didn't know if you were yeah, i i i just wish- that's right. it was a nice little (xx) hi how are you? okay, i just talked to Johanna last night oh did you? she thought_ she had said that she thought you had left Ann Arbor or som- well i am leaving Ann Arbor when are_ yeah? when are you going? this summer, actually i'm leaving, so. so how's she doing? she is doing well.  oh okay yeah wow gosh (it's) been so many years so like when are you, leaving? like August? um, (probably in s-) July but she may come before August yeah well tell her to email me yeah yeah (xx) you taking any teaching time this summer Diane? um... yes uh, we've got a business trip coming up uh week after next um, Susan Williams and i are going to Greece, oh and then, the tail end of that will be, pleasure, mhm mhm it's a nice little town, too. yeah yeah, before, we've always stayed in London because, it's a it's a real city you know, and Stratford is sort of, mhm (xx) (last summer,) two summers ago i was up there, we only stayed for like (xx) (he's got a little) bed and breakfast place, you know? and it worked out just fine, it was kind of outside of the downtown area, very beautiful (xx) so her brother lives here right? yeah. you met you met her brother right? yeah. he's still around. right he did? wow. he got married? wow he has two kids? yeah yeah  mhm. yeah he's now. Johanna's an aunt huh? mhm. yeah. i'm trying to convince her to come. she said she will but, she's i mean, she was in uh Japan Japan? oh wow. yeah. yeah sounds like it (of course) she's got tenure now too i know this um, oh you don't know, remember her boyfriend, Patrick oh Pat? Pat Klein? what's his last name? Pat Klein-Stark Doertier.  how do you know Pat? you know Pat? yeah he lives in my co-op i think he's still there yeah oh, he's there oh, are you still in the co-op Rita? yeah (i used to) live there for years that's why i know oh really? that's how you know Pat? Pat Klein was there, from eighty, he's like the longest oh oh my Lord no no no, i take it back eighty-six, i think eighty-six or, eighty-five.    cuz when she comes, um, they see, each other, i think. um, but i think he's still there, as far as i know yeah that is amazing, that he still lives here exactly something's gotta be wrong with that man mhm. i know don't you think he would outgrow, you know, yeah  yeah. probably. no no no. and he has a good job, isn't he an engineer? yeah. for the car company. i think he's in his late thirties,  yeah. yeah. oh i'm gonna have to tell Johanna. how does Johanna know him? uh he think they had_ she would_    i just can't believe he's still there yeah,  yes, exactly, he is oh yeah he gets those mails right what is this connection? how do  a mutual friend. isn't that amazing? Johanna lived there too. did you know her from there? no, cuz i oh oh okay. she was there in the eighties with Martha. right  (xx) eighties i was there that time, yeah. yeah and, b- Betsy lived there too right? Betsy Mullen? yup Betsy lived there yeah. and she's in Amherst Betsy? oh no no no sh- no (xx) North Carolina cuz i used_ i w- i saw her actually (well not) recently,  no she's a friend of another friend of ours,  all these mutual friends a lot of traffic over there, these days? um, well we have a lot of traffic the last couple weeks because of all the students leaving, and, getting signatures and graduating and all that, so forms, certifications, advice. yeah any chances they well but, well, it would be great i mean i don't (see any,) i mean the, impetus all seems to be towards trying to, cut rather than (xx) Naomi? do you wa- do you wanna run the meeting or do you want me to do it? um, i guess we better um, start now um, there might be a few more people, straggling in um, hav- i- since, um, i guess we could start by, introducing ourselves um, i'm uh Diane Parker and i work in the uh Testing Division, here at the English Language Institute, and i will, pass around a, list, of names, so, here we go... um... let's see, maybe we should just go around and  there might be uh Rachel Ray Highte Biology um office Graduate Program Coordinator Amy Spencer International Center Frank Jones Academic Advis- L-S-A Academic Advising uh Scott Laing Office of International Programs Liz Gamine L-S-and-A Academic Advising Martha Lee Brennan L-S-and-A Academic Advising Kathleen Taylor Center for International Business Education or, just shorthand C-I-B-E in the Business School Patricia Easton Housing Naomi Rey E-L-I okay, um, um, um, i guess usual- usually what we do at these meetings is just sort of go around and uh talk about what we've been doing, um, um um do we go this way or that way? um i have a question for mhm mhm mm on right (now the) early arrival housing will be, open during the whole, period of the course right Patricia? in the no it's yeah starts July thirtieth  okay if anyone needs a flier i have it  oh i think i will need  August twenty-seventh August twenty-seventh noon how long's the I- I- the I-G-S-I will be over by then uh, won't it? the August workshop is for uh three weeks okay. mhm   yeah so, uh do most of these, IGSIs Naomi then um come to the, in,  they find apartments? or mhm  i thought i thought the August workshop people were not, no but some of  but some of them are going to be brand new aren't they? right right some are brand new yeah no i don't i don't think so i mean some of them come to the International Center  but you're saying in terms of housing we   right mhm right. and um, i have had a couple inquiries from people, like that mhm yeah right i'm just_ i'm gonna forward this to the coordinator of the IGSI program Michele Ruffe, okay  yes  cuz, they  well they just requested that we have by May eighth turned mhm mm oh, that i don't  mhm  well we sent these uh um fliers out to many departments, uh that do have, mhm mhm right forward this is good information. this is, this booklet is, is new it's the new um undergraduate,  okay, great. thanks any more, E-L-I stuff, or is that mm i don't really have much to tell except that i have already distributed every, last month the uh E-L-I summer programs okay mhm okay uh, w- i think most of you know Arthur Ward who's also from the International Student he's one of our foreign student advisors and, because we're a little bit um, short of advisors today he's probably gonna just stay for part of the meeting alright well that'll work too first of all the burning question has I-N-S come out yet with any statement about, students from the five countries in crisis? nothing has come yet, okay. and still there's no other, word about what the University is going to be doing to,  well that's not exactly um, an um, an immigration question but you  right yes right right  probably until the affirmative action s- case is settled. right okay, um, but another another more direct um immigration issue uh for students who are, um, who are here now for the, they're doing half-term work, if they've done in the spring okay. when you say okay for them to  with yeah okay let me, just make a comment. normally F-one students, are expected to attend school full-time, for the equivalent of an academic year, right right right right  okay okay spring-summer not okay oh okay  okay. but if if she has done just a, f- winter term she's fine she could be   (when) i did, i tried calling in last week and i know you were, swamped so i, i held my question. yeah for F-one questions it's still Arthur? and um, who's the other one (xx) well i- i- actually we are all, you are all, handling uhuh on  mhm mhm oh (anyone) are there any restrictions or, anything of that sort for, internationals looking to do an internship? oh yeah, okay mm uhuh do they have to be enrolled at the time that they take the internship? i'm sorry? do they have to be enrolled at the time that they're doing? no. no. uh do they still have two, types of internships where there's the kind of, pre, bachelor's degree, and then there's the practical training which which is_ they're eligible for after receiving their  we've got your name and number. can we deal with it on a case by case basis? keeping you know, keeping track of it, and uh seems everything can be an exception oh sure mm yeah yeah well it's so nice though to hear it uh spelled out  (a little change) see (it'll be) even if it does change, is there any other, domain of immigration and naturalization business that's so clear-cut i mean no it's nice to know that there's someone, who knows all this, information it's really, it's, yeah. it's amazing. and we do give um all through the um the academic year we give, workshops during the winter term we we give them like, every every week or every other week so that, students can come and and hear all of this um, at even greater length so um, that's um you know that's probably what you should refer students to  not right now be tax time at the end of June oh God. we just barely made it through tax season this year but, listen i'm gonna go back i   alright okay thanks a lot for coming Arthur. okay okay thank you yeah good to see you... there are no  okay, well i, just passed out the, booklets that, you might be interested in, um i just wanna update you on, reapplication in the residence halls, uh, you probably heard we were having a crunch, and that crunch didn't turn out to be s- such a crunch we we had less sign- um, returning students sign leases for next year, so that makes more spaces for new students hooray hooray, and um, also, this is the first year that students can uh fax back their, leases  so ca- oh can they apply too by fax? well we- we're not online, mm, oh so the application  oh okay mhm  we're working on it yeah, cuz like for summer students are very very anxious sure, sure are there availabilities in most, uh buildings now or, (is it uh) uh yes there will be, there's_ there were uh, you know certain halls that are reapplied for rather heavily, which been a custom for several years, Mosher-Jordan, and um, West Quad, and, and South a fair amount but_ and we're also um, by the way we're we're, placing um, transfer, sophomore students uh, before, i i mean they're kind of like, guaranteed housing if they get their application in, by a certain date, which was, the the uh drawing, March sixteenth i mean April sixteenth or something. which we've never done before we've turned um, we've had to turn sophomores away, and so many people complained because they're like, still freshmen, and um, so we are housing them, this year too and they'll probably, uh mostly be placed in those halls where, uh, there are still spaces, and the reapp, was high. mhm um, i have a couple questions um, what is the um, what is happening as far as short-term housing both this summer and then   Baits will not. we do have a freshman hall at Baits only one instead of two as, okay right so it's basically like Oxford and and that well it's it's also- i think they have uh, spaces in a residence hall for the summer like they last year they had Bursley, (think) they do this year. by the way spring-summer this year, for students is at Alice Lloyd, mhm right (do you f-) cuz of construction. um do you foresee any crunch in the summer, housing? oh, uh- no not really right right cuz there's so many sublets okay yeah who is um, who's doing the mediation services, oh one time i'll i'll bring her along okay Renee Star okay. oh oh that's sounds wonderful what did you say her last name was? Star Star just like S T A R R uh-oh oh-oh so um, i have a question though mhm? is it possible let's say for our students that have been admitted to our summer program, it is possible that you mail them um, leases applications? or? yes um, i- if they're online are they oh we don't put 'em  you can you can send that stuff to me,  some of them are. oh well the- okay no? yeah that's what i've been doing because yeah no most of them have I-Ds already cuz the Rackham students, the I-Ds are already in  will they be online? that i don't know? S-E-D-B? yeah. most likely though. well  mm, so i don't even need to send you not really. um, you know send me, faculty members, and staff members and people that aren't caught by right yeah will you accept uh fax leases from, overseas exchange students? sure that's okay too? good so when do you think those application forms will be online are you working towards that? oh yeah not this year. uh mkay, that would be (really help) yeah. i think Rackham, has their application online who else does? um Undergraduate Admissions they they do... i think so yeah yeah. i think we're ahead of that right? everybody is... but you've got all your off-campus housing those things on the web so   yeah well not all not all tha- a- really what is out there is um, uh, off-campus housing, that's um available through independent landlords. we do not have the uh management company listings on the web oh, okay mm but you do have the management company contact information on the web i've noticed so, so, yeah absolutely it's it's there a- yes we have um, a flier that we sent out with our off-campus packets telling all the management companies, names phone numbers dadada yeah. okay. alright. uh, i'd just like a few things about the center and uh (we've) just gotten through with our internship funding, and we see an interesting trend in that we_ i think in the Business School there are fewer and fewer people applying for international internship funding, which is interesting  oh that's interesting hm mhm  okay, thanks will you have any groups coming, to the University of Michigan, in the fall  mhm mhm great great.    mhm  mhm mhm mhm mhm     it's it varies between sixteen and twenty, i think we'll have twenty mhm okay so they're here for four months from what countries are they? they're all from Hong Kong  cuz there is i don't know, i may sound like an advertising, but there is a go for it mhm (i know where those buildings are) yeah (xx) we don't (xx) yeah, okay (they all fit, they're) usually full for fall term though so that's something  well, well you know um, you could really try i mean if you if you're gonna follow yeah right. right i know the director there. her name is Sherry Martin. but i think this is her last year.   really? how many peop- peop- uh, how many, two-six um two-six-eight seven-one-one-three i think. it's Ecumenical Campus  yeah yeah mhm sounds like the (xx)    oh, see and not Meijer's huh? it's world-famous yes yeah well i can i can sell, you know tickets on the, (and run over again on that van      not necessarily so see some of them could be there and maybe some of them could be (up) it's really you know i recommend, and our, you know what's what's his name Madison? the Brazilian, he just stayed there recently yeah he was there for two months, he w- he really, only had nothing but good things to say about it.   even for short term it would be  yes (sometimes) they really do have available so, you need to talk_ just talk to Sherry cuz i have someone coming in for a month in September yeah well, again they're probably not for a month yeah they're not gonna wanna do it right right if (you work) for the summer i- in this_ in the winter sometimes, because sometimes yeah right  anywhere uh yeah see that's why i come to these meetings i find out you know i always used to think that way. and then, just one time i just gave it a try, and like this person was  mhm oh yeah. yeah well especially winter term i think it's fall that's the tightest oh yeah (xx) yeah yeah and how many spaces are there? i really don't know but there's like two buildings. two build-   and scholars yeah and scholars visiting scholars could you just repeat your institution and your name cuz i, i don't it's Kathleen Taylor, and i'm with the Center for International Business Education in the Business School. thank you... are you with Ali- Alicia's not in the same   yeah they emailed me to say that they were kind of swamped yeah seems we all are yeah... do you want to (xx) Martha. oh yes Martha you can talk about the co-ops, Martha you can talk about the co-op much to my dismay Martha is, leaving us which is why she's going to remain silent at this hm for those um the matching things? yeah but um, i've_ um i believe there is now i don't know how much flexibility, there would um, there would be with that but i just um, um i asked about that at the beginning of this week and that's what i was told yeah  I uh um was it  yeah yeah right and and the other thing is that um, these um, it's it's not a huge amount of um, uh of money although of course every every bit helps um right right  right right right right right (xx) yeah, well we_ so we're_ you know if we get in- inquiries, regular inquiries from students about the oh oh oh oh really? oh really (xx) know about that where would you go? well there's been talk about Elgin taking over, you know, so oh if Elgin moves in, oh right of course   they said about that, mm, ah you mean you'll be transferring from Fleming Building to yeah,   right (that is a nice location.) i think that was important for him, to be, building that was more appealing. so then you probably move to the Fleming Building yeah where we're nice and accessible  i have a question how is, the that issue related to the affirmative action, you know the uh  okay but you're just guessing oh i'm just oh no. no i'm sorry i didn't mean to (xx) i didn't mean to give that impression no i was just for the record sure with this funding for internships uhuh uh, we have funded some undergraduates but mostly we have to fund graduate students. so, mostly, and it has to be a business  right  mhm yeah, actually i had a student who, yeah but it has to be a  okay one other thing that i, just wanted to (quickly) mention um, is that, we are trying, we will, continue to try to get particularly the Korean, group together, um in the fall, the, undergraduate students who have_ seem to have, mhm mhm well i think that's nice that the student association is um, is getting involved and doing that and whatever we can do to right right and the and the reason this is happening and i j- it just, so happened that i saw the the newly elected vice president who happens to be the uh, roommate of the fellow who, who committed suicide, oh oh yeah oh yeah and i know that um, that Counseling and Psychological Services is, um interested in reaching out more to the international student community um, you know making students more aware of what those services are and that might be something that    wow this is a this is a first yeah this is the, this is the first so in fact i've just come, from asking um, the person that was uh, in the hot seat today um, what what suggestion she, she would have for doing more outreach and um so that's kind of in the front of my mind  yeah good great oh that would be great mhm good that's it okay, my turn. um, i i don't really have anything momentous to share with you. in part because i didn't really have any time to prepare and that was because uh, i h- i had jury duty this week   well it was it was a uh, deferral of justice uh oh okay uhuh oh God that's funny (happened in mine and i was there for a whole week) well next time, you can... pay off the clerk not to do her job  not the ones that are in our halls right at least, the ones that we deal with. but many of them of course leave before they've, come to see you and pick up their orientation materials and so we'll we'll be playing a a game of chase uh, with quite a few of them, to make sure that uh, they get their payment schedules and, and other things. but uh things are a little quieter, uh... just a couple of things, uh, we've we had uh, a change in grading policy that might be of some interest um historically uh most grades that, students earn overseas come through and are posted to their academic record and the grades calculated into their grade point averages um, but um, the new the new rule is that the students who directly enroll in uh exchange partner universities, uh, will not have their grades, uh figured into their grade point averages and that's that's a decision by the_ made by the curriculum committee in, uh response to, the issue of grade, uh equivalency um, some some places of course will use different grading systems and some will, uh grade according to a different standard and, so it's just it's just real messy, uh, one nice uh bit of news, uh, we've had a very successful year with a, a scholarship that students apply for called the N-S-E-P the (xx) National Security Education Program Scholarship, which provides up to eight thousand dollars a semester in support (xx) we had fourteen applicants, which is uh, very high in comparison to what other universities will send in and of the fourteen, uh we had seven official winners, of the scholarship wow um. that's great cuz those are fairly competitive they're they're, they're very competitive, and uh the amount of money is is sizeable, it often makes the difference between whether a student is on study abroad or not. what_ why is this called National Security  yeah well    it's a controversial scholarship, yeah mm  oh mhm right  they have to serve you said? yeah, it's it it has to be an internship within a, government, uh office uh oh, okay, do they choose i see mhm mm (while) there's money   right oh that would be what are the countries that the seven are going to? mm, uh, th- Russia, uh, Brazil Argentina South Africa, uh China (xx) mm oh and how much is the uh, what amount is the  and how long do they go to_ let's say if they are in Russia how long do they spend that time in Russia? the program is more likely to award you money if you're uh proposing to study a year an academic year yeah okay right oh do they get full credit for this? if they yeah, uh assuming they go on a program that is accredited. mhm yeah that's kind of interesting there's there's really so little money to support study abroad right okay okay well other um nonimmigration international sort of things. uh we're still um we still have our North Campus office of course what's probably going to um, to happen with that is during the summer it's probably going to go to half-time and will just be um, open from eight to twelve and our assistant director Mary Coppler, will be up up there and then um the second advisor Terri Mancini will be, down on central campus um, in part helping with um, our overseas opportunities office because um, all the students that um are still around and that aren't haunting um, Scott's hallways are over um in the, International Center, finding out more information about, well this is the big travel season of course  so is she getting paid to work down there? for the summer? um, well yes she'll be um, well she'll get a regular salary  okay well that's, well Dan must be very happy. um, oh yeah Dan is well Dan is uh, he looks increasingly stressed every time i go by there because uh, he's really just got students stacked up um, stacked up too so she'll be um, she'll be spending her um, at least her afternoons doing that and then her um, her mornings probably doing some work with international students um but on Central Campus because um, we'll have some people going away on vacation and etcetera so we're um we're trying to kind of even, even the staffing um up a little bit, but North Campus will stay open um all summer just um, just on, uh half-time basis and, instead of a full-time basis. the um i'm in the process of um, finalizing the renewal for the international student health insurance now i haven't um, well it's actually purchasing that signs on the dotted line um, um and we're, we're almost um, at the signing on the dotted line, point uh, so you i- i- nothing is definite until we actually finalize that but um, but (at that) at this point it's clear that um, that the cost of the insurance will not go up it'll stay at the thirty dollars a month for the single students and, we um, we've had pretty good um, experience with the insurance plan which means that um, the students have, the students have not had catastrophic illnesses thank goodness um, so um, we are able to um to actually add to the benefits a little bit and, again not final but some of the things that i think we're going to um, we're going to do uh up until now that insurance hasn't um, hasn't had any provision for um preventive care and, that's not so much of an issue for the students because enrolled students of course can get all of that at Health Service um, but for families it's more of an issue, we're we're going to be able to add a little bit for um for children and be able to cover um, well childcare and um, standard childhood immunizations for children up to age three and then, if we can um which is actually going to be because um of course children at that age have to um have quite a few checkups and so, that's actually going to be i think a help, to the international student families and then, if um you know that works alright and we still, you know have pretty good experience with the plan then, we'll slowly try and add, a few more things. the other things, we're um we're trying to improve are the, um the outpatient mental health coverage and um, since counseling again for people like visiting scholars or nonenrolled students they um, sometimes use that coverage and of course some uh, Counseling and Psychological Services is um, very committed to making sure that students don't have to wait a long period of time in order to be seen, but that means that, they're also doing more you know, brief work with students so if a student needs to be in in counseling for a longer period of time they sometimes need to be referred out and then again they, the mental health coverage is um, is is helpful, um, and then there are um, there are a couple of other um of other things we may, be able to do as well just to um, reduce the um, the amount that the student potentially would have to pay in a, in a serious illness um, and the um, the c- coverage for the medical evacuation and repatriation is also going to um, going to go up unfortunately we had to use that coverage several times um, last year and fortunately um, it um, no student went above the, the cap on that um, but you know it, could happen so, so we're we're kind of um you know, slowly, slowly improving it which is um, which is good i should have the final word on that um, you know probably by the end of this week or early next week and then um, i'll let you know and as usual we will as soon as we get the text of the um, of the brochure for next year we'll put it up on our website as well so that people can access it, um from our website, orientation um, we're still working with the Office of New Student Programs to um, get a final schedule for the international undergraduate orientation they're, mm  right  mhm what's her name? Fumi Ishado, um, but she's um, don't write her name down too fast, um she'll be, she'll be leaving   oh i see so for (our) summer program who can i refer to, for the health   well no i mean, um for the people that would be coming, um... your summer program will be coming at the end of June? June 30th okay mhm, no Fumi will be, will be on her way on out um, by then, but um, well you should just um uh, well wha- what we usually do is uh, is we usually have somebody come to um, to the first meeting of that class and have them  yeah yes  just for a point of clarification. this health insurance program does not include office visits, does it? oh sure it includes office    right uhuh   can i ask, is this M-Care, this health insurance? no no, no no no no  so, i just want to clarify okay well you're going to um, what you're, um, what you're going to do is, is you're going to    uhuh     okay, so hospitalization stuff like (xx) hospitalization um, the need for special referral out for more specialized cuz i was just thinking    okay good thank you okay anything else um?  yeah. Carrie, i talked to Carrie Platt about this just last  oh wow, that's  oh you mean they've all left? no well some some have left but they're_ or or they're in training right  yeah, yeah Carrie's initial complaint was that uh, she had to flip back and forth between a lot of  think it will be oh (xx) so they should be going out probably at least applications for housing from these people should probably go out, (xx) end of May? or  yeah and their apps Amy are you recommending the um, participants that come for the, international graduate student instructor workshop, get this um health insurance? yeah yeah i have my students go well, we we they really should, i mean they're here um, the- they've entered on our student visa and they're here in this country right when do you expect to have your, new brochures printed up, do you think? oh sometime in the mid summer but, for people um, um th- the insurance contract year runs from September one through August thirty-one so your um, um, your I-G-S-Is will actually be falling under the current contract so, you can have a bunch of brochures now, if if you want okay so. even though it runs for that length of time, you have split payments of the premium, right? well from the student's point of view it just runs continuously um, what we do um, is um, is we bill um, we bill the students for every term or part of a term uh, so, and we just, you know so they g- every term they're going to get a, a bill so it's (one twentieth) terms right, mhm probably well they may have gotten them if they've um, if they're in the country into May, they would have had to pay for May, as well which would've been a thirty-dollar charge or if they started in August. so it's thirty dollars for the number of calen- thirty dollars a month, for the number of calendar months that you are in the country. um okay, so if you, if you're starting in August right you'd have thirty dollars for August, and a hundred and twenty dollars. and if it's falling_ if part of it, if part of it fell into the um, the spring-summer term, then they might have been billed, um, that for a summer term, thirty dollars for a summer term bill then a hundred and twenty for the fall term, a hundred and twenty for the winter thirty would cover the entire, uh, summer? no, it's just that one month just that one month yeah, yeah, just from the billing perspective um, what we do is um the person that that sends over those bills, just does the billing once a term um, i mean the- they, they actually are constantly sending things over because there are always corrections but, um, but what they're doing is they're looking at when the um, cuz there're always students saying no no, i'm not really staying that long, i'm staying longer blah blah blah, um but what they're doing is they're looking at how long the student is enrolled within that particular term, and if they're just enrolled for one month within a particular term then they're, then for that term's billing there'll just be that one month. just the one month, okay yeah we did run into a problem with our Hong Kong program mhm right yeah that shouldn't um, that_ that happened so we had to cover their cost    yeah i think so, i think so and yeah i think yours were probably a... (a bunch of them that) we had some, thirty dollar charges (xx) yeah, yeah well all of yeah, um i, i'm knocking on on wood right now but uh, i think we have finally (xx) this, yeah. no i always say that i saw nowhere in my job description that a knowledge of Excel was going to how long ago was that job description written? well. actually i think when i was originally hired they were thinking more of um, setting up for programs because one line is be able to lift fifty pounds   really i'll show it to you oh my gosh i mean how long ago was that? that was in ninety-one yeah, be able to lift, so did they really test whether you_ oh my gosh so don't give me any excuses about not being able to set up the folding tables i guess was the right right right oh well  exactly i've noticed that, a number of you have said, have mentioned um, a lot of office tur- staff turnover and we're experiencing the same thing and i know, at Rackham right now there's like a massive turnover, uh has anybody, uh, have any- anything to share about how to replace our valuable staff with, yeah of course well also y- yeah well Ann Arbor is a, has a very low  although you would you would probably attract if you, if you advertised outside of Michigan, did you? uh, no we just went through the uh, staff  oh if we advertise through, the you mean through the web? and um have you  oh, right. no but our ours, but we're talking more here of secretarial support  no, yeah  i was talking to somebody wh- a nurse uh, who says now they've got a- a lot of nursing jobs open at the hospital    in general i don't, um we just um, we recently fairly recently hired a new, a new receptionist and a person um, in October i got the person who was, who's doing the insurance billing and um, and finding all of these, little problems uh, but um, but in both cases, i mean i think i think we just lucked out i can't really suggest any particular, strategy to, i mean our, our new receptionist had just, moved to town, and we kind of snapped him up before he is, he's really, yes.      oop i'm sorry well that's_ actually (i...) i'm not sure i care. now Naomi's passing notes. right. oh Diane i had a question for you. you you mentioned that the TOEFL,   ah delivered so you wouldn't, you wouldn't download it into your, your own private desktop    as compared to uh, i think it used to be forty or fifty dollars for the paper and pencil test it's a quantum leap  are they doing this in parallel with the uh, older way of doing it? um, they are, for a time um, they they are keeping the paper and pencil test in, uh certain_ the far east primarily it's um, Bangladesh Japan, Taiwan Korea, where actually, most of their tests are given, there, the largest number. um and the reason they're doing that, they said is because um, they, needed they need to prepare more forms, of these this item bank they need to enlarge their item bank for this computer-adaptive test, because th- just this_ sheer volume of people taking the tests there, mean that they couldn't really um, you know guarantee, that you know there might be so much change (of test) people might, become wise to all the item bank, a sh- relatively short period of time, so yeah, yeah. do you have any literature on this, uh this setup   yeah. if you want to stop by my office i can, or i can give you the, TOEFL web_ i have to look it up. or i can  R-H-C-P-T R-H-C-P-T, okay at U-MICH okay thanks okay (sent...) the score reports are probably available much, more quickly as a result of the computerized testing, which is probably  yeah,   they don't, with the G-R-E you don't get your percentage, but you get your raw score, and i'm yeah           but those were the boundaries anyway yeah but um. (well) we're back on the personnel issue if anyone knows someone who would like to be an insurance advisor  it would be part-time, it would be part-time, um, the people that we've had um, in the um, in the past we've sometimes had um, had spouses of students we've had graduate students    yeah well no i would um, and um and i- you know i'm there as a resource too and certainly there'd be a training period um, i want somebody who um, who does uh pay- pay good attention to t- d- de- uh bluh, i'm stuttering here, to detail but um and i- is also, kind of responsible enough to realize you have to be, a little bit careful what you say to students particularly when you're   yeah that would be great, that would be great... but for the support staff issue i've no, the next meeting uh i- is Dearborn i think Dearborn yeah yeah, i'll send out the (xx) i believe so thanks, okay. thank you for the goodies oh you're welcome thank you all for coming well we made a good dent in (xx) it's getting hot isn't it? it's starting to feel like summer it is starting to feel like summer it sure does Kathleen? mhm i need to, get some stuff to her, you can tell her that she's, definitely on my mind, and i have to mail the package to her (xx) okay, i'm sure she is. is Peggy still there? uh sh- Peggy just came back oh wait (xx) okay, she had surgery? no no she was working down in another position temporarily 	1

COL475MX082.json	pleasure uh to welcome Jerry Schneewind here to Michigan again, um, i've been, learning history of ethics from Jerry for, more years than i, wanna count, since first year in graduate school, i think probably the first course you ever, taught Kant at least that that's what you said at the time, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah well s- yeah that was, not meant to be a, temporal RESTRICTED you mean Kant wasn't first? RESTRICTED let's take our divinely decreed canonical break RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i'll just ask it. um... so, uh, we were saying in the break um, you discussed this letter, uh from, from Hume to Hutcheson uh that's, talking about similar aspects of Hutcheson's views and whether, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED pla- ple- it did plague people RESTRICTED well i- m- m- it's e- it's a little different than voluntarism right, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED no but that's the point for for RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED the uh voluntarist position you attributed i think to Law, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and is that because they assume that God not only has power but has, rationality? RESTRICTED i thought it was interesting, how you placed the um, the, Hume section on, um sentiments uh moral sentiments not being derived from reason, um in the context of deism. or, what are these arguments about voluntarism and i was wondering if you could extend that into that, um small passage at the end where Hume's law, figures in, i was wondering specifically whether you, you would say that the, his is ought distinction there might have been a thinly veiled argument against, uh similar to Euthrypo uh -phro argument, uh against the idea that since God wills it it is good. RESTRICTED actually on on this point i mean i, i wonder if, uh the point you're making about, in particular about sort of constitutes- constitutional arguments RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uh, i have a, picture of Hume which may not be the right picture RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED oh no i was saying you weren't RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uhuh i guess if you were a subjectivist about uh moral sense and thought that uh, things we disapproved of were, wrong because we disapproved of them and you thought that we disapproved of them because, God decided to get us to disapprove of them, then then you would, have God uh, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED um, i w- i was just gonna say okay so you're reading him in in denying rationalism. he's uh, he's primarily trying to deny that there's any sort of like like truth that would be binding on both us, and on God RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah i mean i guess what i'm thinking is i mean like, you know Kant's gonna say, you know is gonna, parse categorical as, binding on all beings insofar as they're rational. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah uh i guess i'm not uh very clear, i don't know much about this history anyway but, i'm not very clear about, w- how to construe the rationalists. okay now, suppose somebody, reads uh Calvin or uh Luther and so forth but uh, that he thinks this uh voluntarism is uh, is uh terrible in some way. and it makes God into a tyrant and uh arbitrary and all this kind of stuff okay so that can't be the right story. about uh God and morality. uh so what's an alternative? well he happens to think one alternative is, uh there are some rational necessary truths about morality, you could RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah. well you say there could there could be the rationalists who do- who doesn't say, uh, who doesn't think that the rationality you might say of these, a priori RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah that that that's right. now if you thought that the only alternative to, to voluntarism was r- some kind of rationalism, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it it's gonna be your faith that God cannot be a voluntarist, supporter RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED um i was just curious about the uh rationalist, explanation of revelation RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED w- now they weren't saying the the rationalists we're talking about weren't saying s- revelation is, necessary to salvation would you say? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED uh uh i wonder if you think that uh the voluntarists would be vulnerable to the following kind of argument. uh i mean it it does seem to me that, uh, there is a very strong strand of voluntarism in the scriptural tradition, that they're coming out of. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED every other semester. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED um, so this view, uh that you mentioned that um, in fact, if you haven't heard about the Christian revelation um then you're okay but once you hear it if you reject it then now you're in trouble. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED ah well. RESTRICTED um this is um, um right s- so, so, the way it works if i have it right Hume says look if you want, morality with your, religion you get, sort of uh a voluntarism. only option. right? now... um, can can other aspects of Hume's attack on religion be read as um, sort of two pronged attack here so you got this voluntarism and now you've got ah uh now you've got to rely on things like miracles. and and then on miracles it's, so.

INT175SF003.json	is this working? yeah it's working... um, c- could i take you back to the to the beginning because you're a a mycologist and you use you know a lot more scientific techniques than some systematic botanists was it the sort of... your interest in science that allowed you to choose mycology or was it because you got interested in mycology that, you developed, you know more scientific, techniques chemical tec- or is that a bad question? uh, it's, it's not easy to categorize that way um, as an undergraduate i got interested in lichens mhm  mhm mhm uhuh   mhm uhuh right right   mhm  mhm okay  because you say several times, uh that they're uh important as food sources for small rodents and  i got interested in thi- this, group of, of fungi because they have two important symbioses one is this one with trees for the nutrition, mhm right  right okay that's very right oh oh yeah that's going to come up again a a a bit later um... right up to date now, uh Bob Shaeffer's retired. you're left as the single curator of of fungi. is that gonna affect what you do very much or  uhuh  so i'm star- and because... my mission i guess is better defined with the herbarium rather than an_ as a as- associate curator. mhm  so automatically even whether Bob was still here as a as a curator you, you hafta, you know well  yeah right there's a new hire coming who's sort of w- working on the molecular level  i'm hoping to  oh right.  different, different problem right oh okay... i think what we'll find with him is that he won't have time to (do) curator. mhm. is that, reasonable for a hotshot assistant professor to say you know you can, don't worry about that too much, at this stage? yeah i mean it would strike me as being reasonable it's like yeah yeah that's what basically, how w- how it's treated. yeah... yeah, um, you've got a lot of publications but,  right yeah, you know, on   Aberdeen? David Atkinson Atkinson rather uh i don't consider myself a good writer uhuh, alright. and that's why you you know you know plus it, it requires more time than (i) yeah i just wondered i mean  mhm right. okay. but is that editing or is that, reviewing? i mean is this it's reviewing, yeah. so you get the final product and say you say yes or no, you're not somebody knocks on your door and say, you know, could you read through this and, okay. alright. also i'm in a very esoteric field. uhuh right uhuh... if you you look at the publication record it there s- sort of seems to be quite a clear trend. it seems to me that if when you're working on on systematics, right? uh of of fungi you tend to write on your own, or sometimes with one other person. when you do a lot of the sort of fungal ecology, you seem to join up with you know another person and there's a couple of others like, some, some paper on elevated atmospheric C-O-two and feedback, a kind of a big interdisciplinary thing where you join up with a with a   mhm  uhuh right  mhm  uhuh   uhuh right yeah yeah well, that's right uhuh yeah when i when i look through, it seems to me that the kind of the systematic stuff, over your career seems to go in certain kind of bursts. and now this may be just be because there there there're delays and timelags in publications but there's sort of some stuff in sixty-six sixty-seven there's a couple of papers in eighty-five, there's some papers,   yeah that's right, that's what i was gonna say. there's a (if) there's a big project that's uh, taking your time away somewhat and i have  mhm   yeah. you know i do some sort of uh, quite serious birdwatching, and the ornithologists you know tend to be uh kind of lumpers or splitters i mean they wanna divide species or (xx) but, it seemed to me if i looked at for example your two n- papers in uh, nineteen eighty-five in one case you're setting up a new genus on the other case you're saying these six species are actually all one. so you don't have any predisposition to_ i mean cuz ornithologists seem to have a predisposition is to go one way or the other it all depends on the evidence well, the group that i work in is so badly known, uhuh uhuh mhm   mhm mhm right yeah right now th- the guys down the corridor who do deal with vascular plants and th- they develop their keys and and and so on. these are sort of usable, in the field right? because, while in your case you're often dealing with microns rather than millimeters and you hafta bring 'em back and put 'em  i can identify things t- to genus in the field uhuh right mhm right right  yeah yeah right... right what is Kelly and Judd? color names? it's a standard. just a color chart? a stamp collector's chart? there are various competing color charts. alright. um, going back to your, Destuntzia paper, remember that one? yeah okay Destuntzia himself in honor of professor Daniel E Stu- Stuntz or  he was the mycologist at the University of Montana, who my major professor, Jack Tyler uhuh mhm okay uhuh uhuh (well okay) so what's a Stuntz foray? that is a, gathering of mycologists and students from various institutions uh, at a what's it called oh Boy Scout camp  uhuh right. that sounds good. is Harkness a hero of yours? um one or two bits in this paper about Harkness eight_ eighteen ninety-nine and, suggesting you know that maybe he got it right and later people were perhaps quite not got it right i mean well i've really never thought of him as a hero i di- well perhaps hero is a sort of jokey term but i mean a well, i thought it was amazing that he did what he did yeah right uhuh  yeah Harknessiae. (xx...) and the Latin names that you choose?  right. i don't like color, terms for species names, (crescia) rubens and stuff that   uhuh... yeah, he's an amateur that's what i mhm mhm, hm', alright. okay. where is East East  it's in Kent. okay, i ought to know that. i've now moved on to the uh, you know the Soil Biotron right was that your term ? Biotron was the, the name that's in the literature for similar facilities is Rhizotron. right, that that's an older name right? right and we chose Biotron, because we felt it reflected, the interaction the biology of below ground rather than just the focus on roots... the one that's up at the biological station and the one at East Ma- Malling, these're the two main ones? no there there're a bunch uhuh now is there, this is all sort of  i should give you a paper okay right mhm mhm oh okay John Tanner wrote a paper, uhuh oh okay. you have a copy of that or   one of the papers that you have that's one of the co- coauthored papers this is the New Dawn paper? do you know where this metaphor of the New Dawn came from was that you or some or one of the others or? gee i don't really know. it d- doesn't matter. just wondered whether  when you're the second author of a paper that the_ this means that... you're not the primary writer right but you co-author it or you  right right. but when you say that the first author writes the paper yeah that's what they do but, second and third authors get to comment on it and discuss it and modify it and argue about it   right  right. for a person who says that he doesn't think he's a very good writer, in fact looking at the record there's lots of stuff you've written of your own and there's quite a lot of co-authored stuff where you obviously were the primary writer. right? yeah if i'm first author yeah so... y- perhaps you feel that this is a, a general comment of your field or you  no i'm not i'm below average. i think i write like a German. mhm    oh well i'll i'll remember that, you wait till you see my writing.  it's more than a list of species yeah. it's not a re- just a regional inventory you wanna know, not only you know where they are and how many they are but but why and how they got there. right. um, does that mean that... you're more depende- i mean if if you were going to write, a Hypogeous  i'm i am writing it yeah i mean how many genera are there and how many species and how long is it going to take you and how much, is known and? well i'm guessing that there's, i i could count (but) i probably have thirty-five or forty genera and probably a hundred species mhm right, and how many of them have you tackled in some, preliminary way ? most of them. most of them. (that's) they're sitting right there right. but, but then if you look at at that that article, that Materials (for) there's actually for you a very long introduction. right mechanisms mechanisms... so you know your account, your final account is gonna, hafta deal with all these forest islands and how they  the way i envision the book it will have chapters on uh, what are the hypogeous fungi? right mhm right right s- so i would be right in thinking  right. i mean it would be my guess that... taking that kind of approach, makes you a little bit more dependent on sort of general advances in biology and ecology than say Bill in the Flora where he can, well you there're two reasons that i selected the Great Basin,  right mhm  it just hadn't been collected. mhm yeah mhm   okay alright... i think i'm getting pretty well to um towards the end uh... s- some years ago quite some years ago now i came to talk to you and borrow your your reprint requests and you were telling me at that time that you often did, often ordered something like three hundred copies of uh offprints especially in the, ecology kind of area right  you'll see a big difference in the way they're cited. uhuh. well i didn't... would you like to tell me about that because uh, i mean cuz i didn't look at the actual papers i just looked  oh no i know that, that's become very clear yeah, they don't cite papers no they're all hidden away in the notes. well they're yeah they're hidden away in the, in the species descriptions. yes that's right, yeah. quite strange actually. yeah it is because it makes us look bad. yeah you never you never look as though yeah on the ecology stuff. yeah right.  yeah. although i notice that there are some citations for the sort of the Soil Biotron series of papers you you hoping that's gonna take off in some other kinda way or? uh, i basically consider myself done on the si- Soil Biotron. is this as a result of having this major project out in the field  it's not a lack of interest it's a lack of time. yeah yeah they wanted other people to do root research in there? no they felt that it w- didn't fit the mission of the herbarium. oh okay. oh that director not the director of the biological station. no this director alright, yeah, no but well but you could see i mean i'm an outsider but i don't know the field  well the other thing about, some of that stuff is it's gotten away from, having a direct feedback into the, my interests in ecology and biology of the   right.  you used to get all these reprint requests they've all disappeared because of email and the rest of it? most people xerox stuff now i get  but just just the Chinese or whatever else? yeah and especially now that i'm not publishing in mycorrhizae. it's ahah you cope with page charges and all those stuff and all those  yeah... i've had, the Great Basin project's is in its second three year funding from the National Science Foundation so , and they they're the ones that have told me not to go on a for a third, grant because they want to see a, book. it'll be a book? if i get it done yeah yeah okay well that's all i have to ask you, for the moment. okay, good. 	1
LEL305JU092.json	and that last question th- i know i told the T-A to, be really easy on the on the terrains question. you know that very last one. i have a question  oh that's a small just one point off.  oh okay. what? is this, is that a mistake? thirty-two points? yeah. like a mistype doesn't it. probably meant three, so it was one of the ones i didn't know and i was like, uh'oh. i didn't catch that. are the tests graded yet? they're graded but i haven't checked over with 'em yet. uh, i d- i wanna do that before i hand 'em back. and are they curved? are you gonna curve? oh yeah. well, i never know what people mean when they say curved you know. adjusted to the rest of the class? yeah, it's a_ yes. that's true. but i- it's not to the extent that i say okay, Gaussian distribution tells me that the- there's there's a, thirty, thirty-two percent, one standard deviation, above and below the means. curves always should push up grades. they should never bring 'em down. i beg your pardon? curves should always push up grades (and help those who are on the edge) that's right. (good) are we having a quiz today? yeah. actually. the last one was multiple choice too, but it was, twelve, multiple choices.  well this is only three. you got a better shot at this one. is it based on the reading or the notes? the reading. you did do the reading? right? (i didn't want to)  it counts against you if everybody else gets it right. yeah, well. if everybody else is right i mean, the letter grades are determined before i add in the points so it doesn't_ it's not a competitive, sort of thing. the tests are competitive. but, but not the actual points. it needs a better plot. pardon? it needs a better plot. it needs a better plot. it needs a better plot yeah. well it's too it was too, this way and that, right? well they were that's, one of the reasons i wanna go over it. is there were a couple of key points, made that i wanna emphasize. uh for instance. now we it focused primarily_ it told you there was a lot of geochemistry going on. but it really didn't, go into great detail there. they just said it's it's cool stuff. and it's building these big, polymetallic sulfide chimneys, that are... if it was cheap to get 'em,  if you can do fifty miles you can do the rest of it, pretty much. you what? if you did a fifty mile, stretch you can do the rest of the four thousand. well he he said that was a very special area. that he could predict, that this was gonna be an active area just by, how it looked. you know it was, it was slowing up, it was uh higher than stuff around it. and there weren't any real central valleys in it it was just one big, warp, in the ridge. and so he predicted that this was gonna be an active area. so. this is_ being able to predict in science is a, is, one of the great things. being able_ that means you semi understand it. and, understanding is the ultimate goal. now from the biology point of view, they said several times in there, the fact that this same this whole community, first of all it was completely decimated, by this eruption of lava. they didn't know that that had happened but when they got there, the first time, it was decimated. wi- i i don't think they used this phrase but it was called the, the tube worm barbecue. i mean everything was where did it come from also? that's why it's surprising. where the hell did it come from? i mean these things are, except for the fish, which are following the, the uh, tube worms the tube worms don't, sorta hike up and march off you know. they're stuck there they're they're what we call benthic, organisms. they're screwed into the bottom. they're attached, to the rock. so how, the surprising thing, is how, did they get there? i mean... i mean this_ we're leaping way ahead in the course here because, oceanography's all tied up and it's hard to teach anything in a sequential order without jumping back and forth occasionally. and here we've leapt into the biology part of the course. but, it's a primary question. yes. could it happen (in a series disaster don't they_ the) only thing i can think of is kinda, maybe how plants have seeds but i don't know if that's not a bad idea. she's talking about seeds well, i mean we talk about the dan- dandelion for instance right? i mean we knew how the dandelion reproduces. affects our lawn and even they've got it, what they call an analogy in the, in the film. dandelion puts out seeds that, are picked up by, the wind, and blow to your neighbor's lawn. that's how it works. and so, your suggestion i take it is that the, these organisms must do something similar. the logical_ anything it i- i- unlike dandelions, where, they reproduce by, putting out these, seed floaters, uh but if you've ever, done the battle with dandelions you know that it's also, uh they have roots that will just, if you don't get 'em out will just, regenerate, no matter what. now tube worms don't have that advantage. they don't have any roots. you, you wipe those guys out and they're gone unless they re- in e- in essence reseed. and so that, is really the, the working hypothesis that there is some s- sort of way of, reinfecting, this area. and if you think about it this is a, this is a interesting process here. here we are in the di- deep ocean, with this long linear feature, where there are, hydrothermal springs spaced out, at some distance apart. sort of like little what was the temperature inside that? the smoker or whatever. the- they said it was three hundred fifty degrees centigrade. why doesn't that boil? i mean why doesn't it boil? yeah. yeah is that it or? were you joking about the six-part thing? i'm sorry? were you serious about the six-part thing (or not)? well i mean there's, three choices. that's what i meant. but at first you said we had a six-part multiple choices. no three-part i meant to_ just, three choices. i thought it had six different questions. no no no this is just one question. three choices. okay pass 'em over. yep. have i got everyone's? one more over there. (i'll just) run around... okay that's everybody's the answer is... A. hydrogenous. some of these uh, manganese nodules and such accumulate at uh, you know a millimeter per thousand years it's very very slow. we'll go over that in lecture. yes. yeah would that give you a measure of the wind, direction and the strength over time? direction and what? the the, velocity or? yeah. the size will give you an idea, of how vigorous the wind was. faster the wind the bigger the size. right away that tells you something about past climates. how how much, activity the wind had. now what would the abundance tell you? yes. like if a continent_ how close was that spot to the continent, as the as it progressed because, because, when the continent was closer to that particular part of the, the sea, larger grains could get there because it was a shorter distance and then as, it moved away smaller grains could collect, mhm it's all, very very logical, and um, but not quite right. n- no points off. silicate? pardon? silica or silicate? yeah s- it's got silica in it. you know the element silica silicious, there are a lot of organisms that that sh- that live in the ocean, they live in lakes too for that matter but, that actually precipitate, S-I-O-two, sili- silica dioxide, as a shell. sometimes it's called opaline silica, because it doesn't have a real crystal structure. it's like glass. like window glass. it's no- window glass is not a crystal, it's S-I-O-two, that has cooled rapidly from a melt, of sand and a few other little chemicals, and created this perfectly clear pane, almost pure S-I-O-two, and organisms build their sh- shells, out of much the same material. calcareous. what does that, you know what the chemistry of that is? anyone who yes sir. calcium. calcium. primary, positive side of the, of the equation. it's calcium carbonate that is C-A, C-O-three. calcium carbonate and that's what you always see when you see a clam shell. or a, a mollusk of any type. what you see when you see coral reefs. there're a lot a lot of organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate. and there are a lot of organisms that are planktonic that is single cell floaters that just, live out in the upper layers of the ocean all over the world, and produce their little teeny, one millimeter and less sized shells, out of calcium carbonate. now if you look, at this distribution you'll see, there's a lot of calcium carbonate in the Atlantic. there's a little bit of red ca- clay. red clay is usually defined, where there's not much calcium carbonate and there's not much, bioge- biogenic silica, in the sediment, that's all that's left. so, calcium carbonate all over here, all over there, all over the South Pacific but not much in the North Pacific. we'll come back to this. mostly red clay there. now here th- look where the silicious oozes are. there's a bit up here, in the far North Pacific, and it dominates, the Antarctic region. could you say the question again? huh? what's the question again? how when we ha- when we had an ice age, twenty thousand years ago how mu- and we took water out of the oceans and put it onto land to form these big ice sheets, how much of that removal of water, from the ocean onto the ice sheets will lower sea level? sev- seventy meters? Dave? a hundred and twenty meters? spot on. a hundred and twenty meters. right down to the shelf edge. remember? that was a_ that's where we brought it up. why is the shelf edge at, a hundred and thirty meters? well, it might have something to do with the fact that we lowered sea levels, down to a hundred and twenty meters, thirty, uh twenty to a thirty thousand years ago. so let's, let's look at the model, of what happens there. now the this is t- this is a cartoon but it's, pretty accurate, where you view, here's the edge of the continent here in these little blocks, you can think of this continent initially rifting apart with sea floor spreading, starting to subside as it cools, and here the rivers are starting to flow into it, and of course, they start dropping their sediment pretty fast but it does flow out with turbidites and stuff, and it starts building up this pile like this. and this pile, looks like what we see now. here's here's the shelf here's the s- shelf edge there's the slope, and it just builds up and out, as the, edge of the continent gradually cools and subsides. you with me...? up here, here's the beach somewhere it's stirring up the sediment and moving it off a little bit, down the slope. and then we drop sea level, with an ice age... now this is what i was talking about, suddenly the rivers, that were, originally dumping their stuff up here somewhere, are winding their way across this old shelf, and dumping, their load, right out on this steeper slope. and so what happens, is it starts to build out, another bit of shelf here. the part in the dark shading... sea level rises again this floods back, and you get another, area of buildup slowly out to the edge. so if you had repeated sea level, rises and falls which we have over the last few million years, then you'd see this whole thing repeated again and again and again. and you can see a whole, series of, big progradations big, building out, then small packages and then big ones over the top and then another small one and so on, all the way out until, off the east coast of the U-S where this has been going on for, a hundred and forty million years as we calculated, in our exam, the width here, today, is, a hundred miles or so... huge, broad shelf. (xx) sediments (something like that) bottom feeders (xx) the- they're nonselective, eaters. it's like my son. anything that comes by 'em, are these, like when i was reading today it was saying like something to that extent but wouldn't it also be kinda like, they get a lot of these particles, like that they ate other things or something? like it wouldn't be it wouldn't necessarily be a filter feeder but what if another fish ate another fish,  can i ask a just quick question about that? sure. 	1
MTG400MX008.json	do we need to fill in both forms? yeah just just_ if you just run okay all the way down unless you really object. wow thank you Chas that's really nice. ah you're a sweet gal why not. gonna miss you kiddo thank you, i'll miss you guys too but you know what the best thing is i'll see you all in about three weeks. that's a good  not me you're gonna be out in California  aah, you're kidding. no i'm really  are you going  you're going  so you're just gonna  this is stupid. what's that? well it's for you. i think we're all here, um, the MICASE people are here. and let me introduce the director of the English Language Institute, uh John Swales.   who's, one of the brainchild if not the brainchild behind this. and who's been involved in actually teaching a lot of our, foreign students, English and written language. yes, i teach through your course and just a follow-up from last week's, paper before, Betty gets going. remember i talked about... a mutation in, a mismatch repair gene, P-M-S-two. and that if it was_ if the mouse_ for the knockout, there was no mutation. and Sam made the comment at the end of of one of many that wouldn't it be nice to do this in a regular immune response. so the latest abstracts that just came out from FASEB, has an article has a abstract in it from Matt Hartmann's lab. and they did immunize the mouse, mhm oh really?  mhm mhm sele- a lot of selection a lot of different kinds of selection it had an impact on, um. (xx) mhm i know Heidi? am i up? okay you can cer- you can certainly start. so, we have been trying to determine, (xx) if you remember, a lot of my work is f- focused on determining whether hypersensitive site two, in the gamma one locus is really important. okay, and i had showed you a lot of (xx) data earlier on, where we found uh (N-F-)kappa-B binding sites and stat-six binding sites etcetera etcetera. so this is the seventeen-K-B gamma one locus, it has the I-region, uh site two is located here in between the small switch region and the large switch region, and then it has the constant region. so, Pete when he was in the lab made a transgene that contained... the I-region, uh, contained this the promoter of the I-region the small bit of switch through site two, and then he put on a uh foreign splice site. and they showed that those t- uh transgenes when injected into mice, were properly regulated. it suggested to us that, maybe site two was required for regulation of germ line transcripts. so a second transcript or a second, uh transgene was created, this one has the I, region it has the small switch region, and then site two is eliminated from this transgene, but they included in uh, one of the exons from the gamma one constant region, C-H-three okay, and what we've been trying to do is, determine if this transgene is correctly regulated. and Pete studied three mice, he studied thirty-two fifty-one thirty-two sixty-two and thirty-three eighty-three, you can see their copy number here and only one of them, thirty-three eighty-three is properly regulated. and the other two were so low copy number and they just couldn't, couldn't determine it so we created five more lines with this transgene, those are listed here and i only have data today from two of them, the others will be coming out later in the week. the way, we have several ways that we analyze these transgenes for expression, um, first of all we have been looking at their endogenous locus just to make sure, that, uh we see up regulation of endogenous gamma one gene, when treated with L-P-S plus I-L-four over L-P-S alone, and to look at the endogenous locus we use a primer that's in the I-region, twelve sixty-four, and then we use a primer that's in the gamma one constant region. and we analyzed that with uh primer twelve sixty-three and that's shown here. or that probe is there. we then to look for spliced transcript products. we have two metho- well three, we either use, primer twelve sixty-four which is in the I exon, and primer eighty-four nineteen which we generated, which is a primer that spans this splice site so it's only gonna, detect properly spliced transcripts so it starts in the C-H-three and it ends, on the other side of the splice which is, uh, just this side of the switch region. okay? and we detect that with twelve sixty-three probe. another way that we've used to detect this is we'll use this primer set twelve sixty-four, and thirty-seven ninety-six which is actually in C-H-three. and then we will either probe that with twelve sixty-three, which in that case, you would it would not have to be absolutely correctly spliced to see it mhm but i mean can't you tell by the size?  no? 'm'm okay not really you're running these on agarous jells right? yeah what's the size betw- what's the size of the um, the transgene, so between, eighty-four nineteen or thirty-seven ninety-six in, the I-region? um it's like, forty or fifty base pairs max. you can't tell it when you're running on agarous and blot it, you can't tell the difference. um why is eighty-four nineteen, picking up pro- correctly spliced? because that primer was made through the splice site. so, if it's spliced it would be negative? so if it's spliced says it's positive. isn't the splice acceptor on the on the beginning of C-H-three? yes and that this pri- this primer spans that. no, it its, it spans, the splicing goes like this. i i couldn't draw this, that way but the splice    um, alright. so, when we look at thirty-three eighty-three, using, this_ Pete did this work using twelve sixty-four oh yeah  so so for thirty-three eighty-three, if i use these primers, and i use the twelve sixty-three A probe you get right regulation right regulation yeah if i use the splice region  i don't so wha- what's the difference? wait a minute you s- exactly. the only difference is this twelve sixty-three A, this splicing event doesn't have to occur, exactly correctly, mhm so you have a couple of possibilities. one is, in (it's) endogenous and you're getting this screwy splicing all the way down to C-H-three. do you have a control f- that rules that out? i don't think that's alright no wait a minute, doesn't matter whether you have splice or not you're gonna get the product, by eighty-four nineteen. if you, coming from the outside primer. i think that's why it confused. no it's not splicing, you see the eigh- that eighty-four nineteen primer is, half C-H-three and roughly a half I exon   no eighty-four nineteen eigh- okay so you're using the outside primer? right outside primers twelve sixty-four and thirty-seven ninety-six right mm correct. if we use twelve sixty-three A, we see proper regulation, if we use eighty-four nineteen, there's no regulation we see expression in L-P-S as well as L-P-S plus I-L-four. hence the confusion hence the confusion. this is just one of the oh uh let me, let's fi- let's figure out the possibilities here first bec- either i think either way you should've kept the product. okay. so... let's see maybe you could just do it right here Heidi just put eighty-four nineteen on one line and drop twelve sixty-three down to the next line then put the results over to the right of there. alright so this for thirty-three eighty-three, is L-P-S positive, L-P-S plus I-L-four (xx) for thirty-three eighty-three. this is L-P-S, negative, L-P-S plus I-L-four positive okay i guess what's what's confusing is so, if you if you do P-C-R from twelve sixty-four with the uh thirty-seven ninety-six mhm     right, so eighty-four nineteen spans, here to here right so, so either that's ri- s- that's why the splicing doesn't matter. you're gonna get eighty-four nineteen at least  right correct. regardless of what you get, whether, you have, the splicing is weird, you shou- should still have half of this, labeled all (ago)  right. right but that's not the issue, the    but if you use twelve sixty-three... you do get proper regulation. right and actually... you can ask the question with the first pair. is there any difference in the intensity of L-P-S plus I-L? i did a, dilution analysis, oh what happened with A? if you use the uh eighty-four nineteen as a primer? uh, sorry? in A? in A? (xx) in A for the primer set is that twelve sixty-four and eighty-four nineteen i've never done it oh you  no if you use the twelve sixty-three as a probe do you see proper regulation? using the prior pair twelve sixty-three and  yeah A um what do you see? we see... i think that's on a blot right now to be completely honest  okay so if you look, down here in this area, can everybody see that? yeah okay. so, this is thirty-three eighty-three, the- these three lanes one two and three are L-P-S, one two and three are L-P-S plus I-L-four, this is dilution, same concentration of C-D-N-A pretty much to start, from I by H-P-R-T analysis, three lambdas, three quarters lambdas three sixteenth lambdas you can see that they both even out at about, i mean, L-P-S plus I-L-four might have a little bit more what's the dilution series, under sorry? three-fold dilution, four-fold? uh four-fold dilutions. so at most there might be a two-fold difference? maybe yeah and that could be accounted for like i said by I looking at H-P-R-T, you know you just, kinda guess, so, to me that's pretty_ it's there. and it's it's pretty close.  with L-P-S? yeah yeah, i don't know, is it it it's oh wait i think i lied. maybe not. i have done. what you just maybe okay... if you do the twelve sixty-three i've only done this once the second one is on blot now, if you use twelve sixty-four and thirty-seven ninety-six as your primers mhm no that's yeah with the  right A condition (i have) too many jells here. but no i think that one's on_ you wanted A that one's on film now. do you know if the product in the, when probed with eighty-four nineteen is the right size? uh i mean it cou- within forty base pairs? it looks like it. really? and that's the best i can tell you is that it looks like it. there's gotta be some kind of (an arc there) but you don't pick it up by, i guess from the nontransgenic do you? oh yeah sorry. this is nontransgenic out here L-P-S L-P-S plus I-L-four, you don't okay it's a transgene (xx) of some kind yes have you amped with eighty-four nineteen at all? with thirty-three eighty-three? anything, well yes it'd have to be that one. right. or or, thirty well no yeah thir- anything. yeah absolutely. so it it functions okay as a primer? yeah. i'll show you that data in a minute i thought maybe it was sitting down someplace, you know i know okay, i'm gonna go on to the next line. because i don't, i think you need to see it all and then, maybe we can talk about it. um, okay. but when you do the P-C-R they are coming from the same R-N-A prep? in other words the  hm so so we're looking at one two three at least     nice really nice so now if you take this is the oh-three mouse?  oh i see why (it's gonna be completely) looks nice with a different set of primers? with, right, with those so th- i had i- i don't have thirty-three eighty-three data to show you but, with the same probe, so the probes are being consistent, for different primers right on, dif- on different mice, but there's still consistency. do you with the eighty-four nineteen? um, twelve sixty-four thirty okay. if i take this is the best mouse, we have, right now. if i take, this set and i do twelve sixty-four on thirty-seven ninety-six with the eighty-four nineteen, uhuh  L-P-S plus I-L-four, four-fold increasing so here,   so, and i'll reprobe this blot with twelve sixty-three but i just, i just got this stuff off so, um. so forty-five-oh-three looks great, it's beautiful. it does everything we expect it  now you can say that but it still doesn't, we c- we c- that's not, an answer to the problem if we look at f- (looks like) something else is coming   can't see it... is it from L-P-S? okay. so  or maybe you got (I-L probe ) that isn't there an awful lot (of) L-P-S? compared to the other mouse? yeah. okay? if line forty-f- yeah but (it's just doesn't look like an I-L-four probe) mhm so it's gonna be like fifty-one and sixty-two? yeah and its high copy number. i mean w- we always thought fifty-one and sixty-two were because they were one copy, but now we've got one that are are they head to tail do you know that? i don't, i think they i think they are but  tell you that for sure cuz if they're head- maybe you've got a competition head to tail here and that's what's what's... preventing, you need some more of the cop- internal copies from, expressing properly, or expressing at all or it's, completely an insertion site   which pr- for below which probe did you use, your body was blocking so i didn't eighty-four nineteen or twelve  okay that's what i was trying to  but anyway, it's not it's not responding, in either... s- with either set up the primer's not being (real-) okay, so it's at least that's internally consistent (with the other) setup of mice. so that is where we stand we've got three more lines these two, we'll have data on by Monday, this one has been just a hell breeder and so it ugh yeah but, you have three lines that are essentially, fifty-one sixty-two and oh-seven are essentially nonresponders, so then   yeah and but, we can we can say that that those, possibly those three lines, are non- nonresponding. they're missing_ either it's an insertion side effect which is, boy that's, the way to see (what if) (xx) see this again with the higher copy numbers. well these, these two are both one copy  okay but,  yeah so if it could be it's a critical element, but th- on the other hand, with two of the lines eighty-three and oh-three, you at least have, proper regulation. uh screw the results with one of the primers and probe but you know, let's  okay two out of, eight. well, we don't we don't know about those last three yet, but so then you hafta figure out what you make of that i know i mean it looks like it's throwing a s- it's throwing a strong dependency on where the hell it is mhm... position independence and, yeah site two is critical. maybe  should those two mice (be) one copy their, the expression level is too low, that's why you can't  he used the by P-C-R? he did it by P-C-R he used, but_ then the only method Kirk ever used was this one right here okay and you have to use P-C-R (by the) obviously, if you take out that switch region on any of our transgenes then, you (use) only the P-C-R to look at it. now the other thing i should bring up, is that, before i was in the lab a long time before i was in the lab, th- the lab made a bunch of promoter transgenes, fused to, four different reporter constructs three different reporter constructs, cat luciferase and uh three how much of promoter how mu- the whole_ as far as i know the whole promoter um        there was like a minus fourteen something or other and minus  no no   oh okay. um, they yeah, but they they did the whole thing that's been reported to be, required, for transcription. um, and with three differ- attached to three different reporter constructs, none that's critical so you have data for five of 'em. let's just ignore the ones that have  okay and so uh, if you're counting thirty-three eighty-three? yeah. wh- which has the one screwy result,  so that's, that's sixty-six percent two out of the three are, actually being properly regulated. (xx) right possible mhm... that's correct except if you wanted site two to be, well no yeah well, it's low so it it could be important well i thought the low we had_ Wes had decided was due to the sw- the uh, lack of the switch region yeah lack of switch  right  mhm well another thing is with these we can't look at recombination right so those, tha- that transgene had the same length of the promoter as you just said, which didn't work in (this transcription.) so why didn't you guys use the same length of promoter which   no no, the, i- we we looked at, whether just the promoter alone could cause, properly regulated, right mm then, okay i, think there's other, don't know that for sure but i'm pretty sure there's other, constructs which work perfectly well and pro- properly regulated high level expression for example they had the switch region and, they had the same amount of promoter, so i i don't think that this is the_ this_ the length of promoter that we've got here  yeah okay so remind us of the site two what the site two knockout, looks like, as far as, you mean the one  uh, has it been studied (for) combination, (do you know)  yeah i think part of the switch region's gone i believe that's true  intact C-region so we can look at  and it has a num- it has a number of base pairs of the switch region including (octomers,) i think. yeah yeah mhm but it is smaller hm hm so, that's all i have to say now John you make a good point. that is that... it does, at least in two of the con- two of the, transgene arrangements, it does have these, essential elements, for proper regulation, albeit at a low level yeah and again wh- that doesn't mean site two's not important for mhm right   and for this part B? yeah yeah... that's really odd yeah. i st- i probe it i strip it i reprobe it. and i see it and well and you've seen it before so it's, with different C-D-N-A 's? with different, for thirty-three eighty-three this is the second time i've seen this. let's see if i have anything else in here that i can show you are  mm it's C- all C-D-N-A from the same R-N-A we've only killed one mouse for each of these experiments so (then) is it possible maybe the L-P-S alone is not L-P-S alone L-P-S with I-L-four? the endogenous doesn't suggest that i've done endogenous   oh yeah that's right  that is really weird so those... is it possible that the eighty-four nineteen somehow, no it doesn't make sense either never mind. and i, i don't have the data, this is being repeated, but i can tell you that when we used twelve sixty-four and eighty-four nineteen primers and twelve sixty-three A probe, mhm  that's what it's_ for that line, that's what it's looking like if you've got eighty-four nineteen involved at all we're seeing it in both yeah... crossed a bridge with a troll underneath it and, you thought you'd escaped him, and you didn't... these probes are um, end labeled with, (alios) right?  yeah and are the intensities equivalent? basically between um, those two probes, when you probe the same P-C-R reaction? um, my recollection's yes i don't think i have that data here. but my recollection is yes. just a thought yeah... no i don't have that here with me eighty-four nineteen would not become endogenous though, would it? the endogenous should splice between the I-region and C-H-one. shouldn't splice with C-H-three. no reason it would pick it up if they put a little bit of it on the (five) prime end of that (polygote,) or, well (three prime end of the ) actually... hybridize it with the I-region and, i guess the uh the sequence of eighty-three (eighty-four) nineteen is not gonna be in the uh C-H-one. we went through significant pains yeah, that is true i bet  yeah, that was, definitely something we, we're very careful  how about you guys, anything? we don't have any. before you destroyed the cake what did it say i i missed that whole it said ha- oh i'm sorry. it said happy prospecting Heidi. ah you go to g-  California you'll be you uh, prospect. (xx)  so she gonna treat us well when we go over there  see? she better yeah i'm gonna be living at uh Kirk's parents' house when you guys come where_ they already live there in California? they live in Saratoga, which is, you know, twenty minutes from Stanford, so, we're gonna just stay with them until we find a place. they have two extra rooms it's gonna be expensive over there. yeah, it is so you have to have a job well, that's the general plan is that really? so there's  and she said that that the company that she's working at now is hiring and, so mm i think it's  ho ho yeah. but you gotta pay living expenses and it's a bit higher. my sister lives out there.  it's a lot higher. hey why don't you do this, because, we have to decide whether or not we're really gonna how much more we're gonna pursue this, this... in other words you guys have no suggestions we tried a whole bunch i know (short of) brain cells  yup  oh but you know y- the cont- the controls with endogenous works see, wasn't this really a problem, potential problem in case you had a splice? that you you couldn't distinguish the uh, endogenous from the, transgene  yeah right right but but but the endogenous you showed us isn't pr- isn't, y- is not pro- it's not positive for that thirty s- not now, at one point it was oh okay oh okay so okay yeah, these last few experiments i've been doing i- that nontransgenics have come up positive. negative. previous to that before we made eighty-four nineteen   well one of them is the  hm? one of them is the mouse, you can't do anything about that. one of the transgene and and insertions you can't do anything about that, or the transgene. but i'm making new uh, for each of these lines today i'm making, setting up new cultures so we'll have, two mice, from each of the lines to look at,  gosh this cake is heavy. with (the) many   like, ugh you didn't have to eat the rose. you could have just scooped it   plenty of sugar and fat in it... oh... yeah i forgot to ask for a fat free cake uhuh yeah right right i just wasn't sure you're_ that you were gonna be here next Friday. i had this feeling  its my my choice would be now yeah, (that's what i_) we're we're t- we get the truck Saturday morning, and are hoping to leave Sunday afternoon. and so, my choice would be that i have pretty much everything wrapped up in here by Wednesday or so so i can be packing, but yeah   ask for John to take over yeah John'll be thrilled (xx) he's already i can see it that'll start gathering dust quickly yeah not like you don't have enough of problems of your own to  the what?  and this green frosting is good yeah it's almost as good as the pink though i think if you're gonna eat you have to eat the real stuff, oh yeah   yeah, exactly sort of like saying Denver and Superbowl champions in the same sentence okay why don't you just do this okay so the current  ha ha ha shh but three H is lower though, i mean all three of them. right? wh- wh- what, yeah why  yeah. and for this  why don't you put the number, of clones that had more than say uh, one or two mutations. okay, let's say more than two more than two mutations. so this, if it_ more than underneath each one of those columns okay, yes we got two clones, there's two out of eight. and, here we got one. one? yeah for the_ i thought there were fi- three there is one. the problem is we got one with five mutations here. what were the other ones? this one two or more, sorry, i'm sorry. two or more okay now we got two... yeah, this here we got two sequences with three mutation each. then, do the other (ones too...) we we still haven't done the control yet. with this, ex- uh, (can't think of it,) what is it? five it's the N-P-R any mutation may be relevant cuz the P-C-R errors are really are much lower but (here) and the one  yeah, this guy has five mutations in one clone yea- in one clone. ooh but the one, it has not yet been sequenced for, three prima bit, and the two that have mutations does not have any mutation upstream it hasn't been sequenced yet we couldn't read the  okay   and then so the question is, you know he's, doing this but then how much how far do we really wanna go with this because now you're gonna talk about, since we can't, immunize and get, um... a V-H and a V-L that we know something about. these mice don't respond unless we back-cross them on appropriate... strains of mice, which i'm not sure is worth all that kind of work. so but i mean still, you know it's_ so the uh, number of clones may be, similar between, more plus plus or minus minus but overall, frequency's gonna be, less   in the end we may see, there are two or three (xx) okay...? between these two, in the end. so, i'm not sure whether that data is convincing. we have to treat it statistically and i suspect with (N) eight and fifteen clones that won't be the case, we won't be able to, prove that. yeah we, we can do more clones of this, we have a lot of this we can do this  yeah we can possibly do more (negations,) get more clones. it might be better to do a different mouse though. do two additional mice. or at least uh, another w- uh knockout mouse... then you'd have it, you know, you're really repeating the experiment. mhm... yeah we, yeah we can (start) another mouse. but at least at th- at the present time it certainly does not eliminate mutations so the MAR only has an effect, five prime of it? i mean if that if that is what the hypothesis is is that the MAR is only gonna affect, five prime of where don't know that. there's a... paper that's been submitted by Milstein that he references in the paper, that he published, that that, indicates he's that he's studied this in transgene mice. which is problematic because, if you move the MAR say five prime, mhm uhuh, yeah uhuh mhm that's a little bit you obviously expected a greater difference than what you're seeing here. yeah Bill Garrard says the MAR is important he's he's studied the MAR for i don't know, fifteen or so years, and he's got, like i said last time we talked about this he's got a MAR that was- gave us a MAR knockout and they had looked extensively, for all kinds of effects on B cell B cell development B ce- the expression of of different genes and found nothing. so... it's_ whatever it is, it's apparently pretty solid. or else he's not asking the right question. so... we have generated, a hybridoma that i'm gonna send him, which has um... a known, V-kappa that he can study, compared to a control animal for uh transcription rates so he'll  we got  you're cooking something. my god, you guys need to, explain (what you got instead of cooking alone ) new okay okay thanks for the cake Lathe yes 	1
SGR175MU126.json	go over, like, the exam, like, other information that you guys wanna know you know things like  most time like i don't understand like the questions on the, on the practice  okay. so i probably_ it probably would be more helpful to like, go over main concepts and like lecture notes and things like that you   definitely  um i didn't have a lot of questions on the ex- uh the practice exam except for the short answer.    and just, whatever,   i didn't finish the short answer yet. you  you just  okay. and how was the multiple choice for everybody? it's   yeah it was   it wasn't  yeah i guessed  you guessed  yeah    okay so why don't we do this? why don't we go over the lecture notes and make sure that we covered everything and  okay okay that, alright okay? alright so we started with i remember like the D-N-A um, are we go- aren't we gonna be be in the, non-cellular world,   yeah okay (xx) i remember we_ us two went over it right yeah i think a lot of the stuff's kind of just, mostly what he said in class. except for, i don't really understand like just looking at the first section? yeah (where are) my questions? what do, you guys have any questions on that first lecture? yeah uh, i tried to match up like um, you know the all the different kinds of viruses viroids plasmids uh trans-    right right   converting but, transposons D-N-A virus and the plasmids are all involved in, the_ using D-N-A and going, somewhat  okay okay right but it it goes on to make proteins as well right it does. and transposons are sort of mysterious or what? transposons yeah i didn't really understand how it moves around the genome   the segments of D-N-A that move from one location to another in the genome. discovered in nineteen forties but not accepted until later. yeah i forget what  i remember when we were talking about there_ remember how we were talking about there're different um phases of like virus tacking if it's um, if it's goes into the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle, right he didn't really talk about that in class though did he?    right he never talks about   oh   but isn't lytic and lysogenic just whether, it dies or not? whether the cell's destroyed after right. because, in in one condition in one case like, the cell that's gets infected, will explode and like, whatever. right? but like, in another case it could be two or three cells that, after several replications that it does that. so what does that mean for the transposons? what like the thing is that like the transposons it s- it says like it jumps from like, from parts of the genome to other parts of the      right   so the, so the viral genes haven't been         yeah mhm  you mean this'll     so, why do they say it's like a defective virus? that it can't get into a particle without like a protein? it guess i don't understand that part of it then. i don't  you don't? yeah  he just said it he didn't or- didn't write it on the board. it's a defective what? virus, it can't get it into a particle without a protein. can't get it into a particle what particle? i don't know i just wrote it down.  mhm oh so maybe it needs, you're saying that the transposon needs a protein to enter a cell? (really) it doesn't      so wha-  so it doesn't have      see tha- see that right above that i have it's part of the D-N-A is replicated along with the D-N-A so i don't really understand how it's like a part of its D-N-A is replicated along with the       seems to me more like of a genetic defect doesn't it? yeah mhm   it can't,   okay what        it doesn't. that's what she's saying is that like long long time ago right? some virus was created. right? and, long long time ago this virus infected a cell. okay? and, somehow maybe it didn't have the correct D-N-A. right? it didn't have the part of the D-N-A that coded for the protein coat. okay right right. no i know i get that so it doesn't have a protein coat but you're saying that it's already in the cell, so, why does it need a   it's not  it's just something that goes into the cell and it's using it's polymerases to make more of it and then it leaves. it's just like using the cell to produce more of  right  but i also think that even though you didn't talk about the lytic and lysogenic cycles that, sometimes it can still insert into the the D-N-A but i don't   mhm  yeah. right?   right yes. so then if this were to like, burst out that'd be,  (xx) (how does a) transposon move from one location to the another? just moving around (xx) oh just moving around that like, s- that's that's your genome that's (xx) mm it (ori-) it evolved originally from a, a virus (xx) what they're saying is that over time (xx) (just in the genome) (xx...) so what does it do? (i don't know just kind of it all organizes) (xx) it's just part of your genome. mm i think i'm gonna look it up in the book (xx) (xx) i remember learning about it... (xx) i remember (xx) (it's gonna be a problem) on the exam (xx) but it could get knocked     and then right          so why would they hav- have even thought it w- came from a virus if it's just like part of the D-N-A   cuz it just says that all he wrote was on these notes were segments of D-N-A that move from one location to another. right  and i- you know the other thing too is that like, how can they name a virus rather than like,     so i understand like i guess i don't   i- i think it does cuz use that  it doesn't_ i don't_ like, maybe it would help to know like what kind of like diseases that it causes     oh this (is looking like kinda different) (xx) so that's the movement that's  oh from plasmids to genome to    genome's in the like that's the_ it's an example from bacteria. genome's like your chromosomes the plasmids are just like  more than one (xx) yeah that's stupid though. it's like just  it seems like they   oh yeah   mhm yeah,    yeah  yeah it just seems        maybe. yeah i don't know did yo- did you guys talk about it in discussion? was it like  (xx) yeah so just   okay. so okay when you said like stuff moves from, plasmids to chromos- what did you say about? stuff is like moving from plasmids to that it can take like, if you_ in the book it says like it it  pretty much the main idea is  okay it gets_ it makes a target site and it     right okay   finger_ i remember there was like fingerprinting, yeah       yeah okay so  southern blotting. oh that's when you put the two like mother father  of,  did you write    yes. it's more_    okay, this is what i remember from fingerprinting but i think you guys should listen to me to make sure   right  (can i have that?) okay (xx)  oh yeah         yeah so you think that,  yeah i think that (xx) charge goes from like the negative to positive side. i think that's how       right   right    yours is a different one. of,   right and yours wouldn't    so then um i think those are just like more like, if there's an insertion or deletion it's going to be shorter or longer you can detect it when when you do P-C-R, you're gonna get like replications of uh the chromosomes, so say you have like an insertion in yours that i don't have yours are going to be longer than mine, and that would be detected in P-C-R. or yours would be shorter if you had a deletion. i think it just does (like)      right but i'm saying that l- you produce 'em in there, and it says detected by P-C-R, that's what he said in class i think didn't he? or what what did you put down   that's just kind of what i   so maybe what she's saying is that like yeah you have detected by P-C-R caused by insertions or deletions. okay so pretty much what she's saying is that like you don't p- okay you put your um, D-N-A into, P-C-R to get replicated se- several times  mm. okay. right does that help? yeah okay so you make several copies of the genome. let's say that Diana has like insertion of like nine and_ nine like, amino acids or something like that in hers. mhm   right okay okay yeah there's just gonna be two, we're gonna run our whole thing. yeah you don't cut it up you don't do anything with it      right cuz our D-N-A is gonna be different length because it might have deletions or something and i might have insertions.   right yeah you don't    okay. so P-C-R detects it, what cuz it just because well because, if you didn't_ because you don't do anything else to it other than P-C-R. you're just replicating your D-N-A over and over over again.    (so then,) this o- this one is just like, where you're like, defining, the differences (in within the) type?   right  right right right    okay     to right. yup it's kinda yeah i thought that was kinda weird i was like detected by P-C-R? yeah but i just kind of blew it off and said it would be okay. but that's just like a step in tr- doing it really.      uh i think you might. you might...? yeah cuz either way you're     right  it's just strange that he'd like point it out like as this  like aren't you_ don't you have to use gel electrophoresis for, S-S-L-Ps too?  i didn't think you did but, i may be, i don't know i feel like just he kind of didn't make a big deal out  yeah you guys have a review session though today right? yeah you could ask that question i guess. yeah um, for the, experiment, i don't know this is kinda like, i guess a lecture behind this one but why is it on the plates, you have that like antibiotic resistance or something you know when you like spreading around like i don't understand that part of it. okay. um some like ampicillin resistant gene    i get that (sort of) go ahead. because the_ you only wanna like_ you're only examining the bacteria that like, might have the, insertion of the restriction (i mean,) or  fragment   mhm right      mhm    oh okay but it'll still be amp      right    right right okay okay.  ampicillin resistant am- like the, the fact that your seeing anything means that it's ampici- it_ you have your plasmids. yeah  right yeah  yeah  and cuz the white had the lacZ gene broken,  so your white      when you say plasmid like when you're looking at the plas- does that mean that like, those colonies that are colored whatever are they those, cells? what are they? they're like colonies of plasmids?   the little little cells  the the it's it   yeah  but like the   yeah okay. cuz part of them like gets transcripted and translated or whatever to make the blue? okay. yeah. like what she was saying was okay. well let's use this example again. cuz plasmids are just circular D-N-A. yeah i think so i think so (xx) i don't know whatever. okay so you have this thing right? you have this, plasmid, okay? okay. and then you have this plasmid. right? so like step one was to get this this recombinant plasmid. right? and this recombinant plasmid, inserts into the lac- whate-  normally makes   right     yeah  right right  okay... next lecture...     okay you know how they use like retroviruses to, cuz like to get, um prokaryotic bacteria to replicate, or to translate, eukaryotic D-N-A? mhm    yeah   oh yeah    so like i don't get like    how it's useful? well just like i guess i don't    mhm right       yeah    you can put_ now you can insert that into bacteria and have pr- bacteria, produce that insulin that you need. okay okay yeah, i think so. but why are you putting into bacteria to begin with? just to replicate it? to, well okay um, like, number one like when you like_ gene therapy. reason why gene therapy doesn't work. right? you like insert some D-N-A into your cells, you don't even know like just like this case right here, you don't know if your cell's gonna take up w- take up like, the D-N-A     oh, so the bacteria just does it  okay       okay okay does that make sense? yeah    right because in order you wanted to use retroviruses because okay remember you have, different types of um, infection of of viruses like D-N-A virus, R-N-A virus, like things like that. right   right but in our body couldn't we just put it in our cells? yeah couldn't you just, get that little piece of D-N-A and insert it into your genome? yeah  i don't think that like... i don't think that that's the necessarily like the correct way to think of it because sometimes, your D-N-A doesn't, like, your D-N-A sometimes doesn't get put directly into your genome, it may be something that's just floating out that's like, it h- i think it also has to do with context with the question.  yeah       i almost  introns (xx) no no no i mean like the virus i'm sorry mhm reverse  yeah, their own polymerase right? because why do they need their own polymerase? because there's no R-N-A polymerase like in a normal cell when they infect it. right to duplicate itself right? so it has to carry something  right.     no cuz you ne- we never do R-N-A replication in your cells, you just do D-N-A replication. and then you do transcription translation we don't do R-N-A    mhm, cuz they're f- much faster. i think that's what he said, in lecture, when he was talking about_ that was like the day of the exam. okay, and also    mhm correct? yeah okay but what about the protein, coat? just goes away doesn't it? doesn't_ wh- i know there's a difference between D-N-A um, viruses and R-N-A viruses that they n- have to also bring in their own like,  i thought R-N-A viruses just like they only have to undergo translation to make their protein coat, mhm     so R-N-A viruses are just more ef- efficient? is that right cuz they just go in and they're already R-N-A so they don't have   so what was the thing about the retrovirus- viruses (xx) okay the    right mhm R-N-A mhm okay i don't have my old notes in, in my notebook. yeah i don't h- don't you?   when you're doing transcription is there R-N-A polymerase in transcription? i think so in order to_ yeah        well you never i thought you said there is no R-N-A polymerase in the cell. yeah that's what i was_ now now that you say it now   i don't um it has special R-N-A polymerases is one thing you said that's all. so it's like a special thing    right,  right and so therefore wait wait  exactly.  the polymerase it brings with it the that she circled is special because it         okay okay so now we got that thing down. yeah okay, but_ we still have the retrovirus thing there's,     this is um viral D-N-A and then here's a retrovirus, viral R-N-A. it's actually_ you're gonna have, this is and then that D-N-A goes in here to make more R-N-A? right, i i think this is the reason why we're here.  look in chapter  uhuh  to ask what he asked, in that thing, in your exam. because i don't think he was expecting you to know more than you should've. does that make sense? no   okay okay  just that our retroviruses were used as gene therapy? yeah, yeah okay. but do you get what like i don't understa- like i just don't     uhuh yes right right mhm  yeah i think that    yeah      right okay so  hm i was    okay then also cuz he like mentioned how s- how it like it... the H-I-V virus  it's a re- it's a retrovirus yeah they_ so it yeah it's a retrovirus cuz they say in human gene therapy you use a defective retrovirus. right, what they mean by retro- defective retrovirus is that, the D-N-A or the R-N-A that it carries with it, isn't, harmful to your body it's actually helpful to     okay   uhuh yeah i don't_ the example of H-I-V all i wrote was that it, doesn't kill the cell it just uses it to reproduce and weakens your cells. and more of it weakens your cells   no he didn't like get into all that detail  okay and i th- i don't wan- i don't wanna tell you  and whenever_ w- he said it's a vector you_ is a vector just anything that like you kinda like ins-     it's just something that like can introduce  okay i wish i could call my boyfriend. because he did, did you guys have to do presentations in bio, 'm'm oh,  no no?   really? i'm not sure   i think we should    okay okay, so then gene regulation, is your next one? yeah  uh lecture twenty-four. a little ways into it. sorry oh. okay okay okay. go. in   i was like what does that mean? um, is a gene that is expressed all the time in all the cells is what i have. where are we? genes, needed for translation oh i see constitutive means it's not something that's always expressed and variable it's just expressed sometimes. yeah.      constitu-  is all   um, also in the antisense thing, is that basically just  right right you're g- you're jumping back to gene mutation but yeah. yeah it says that i-  that's okay. i was just looking at this section. cuz it says um... it stops M-R-N-A production, but isn't that wrong? it doesn't really stop production it just inhibits, translation.    it think it just disrupts its function   so like inhibit that ge- whatever that M-R-N-A was gonna go and   okay      for a third leg (xx) whenever they talk about that i always think of like you know like in, the Simpsons where like that fish has  yeah okay alright. so let's, start out with um (xx) prokaryotes and, use operons and you've got re- a repressible operon or an inducible o- operon, right? okay so this is where you're talking about the lac operon and, oh   yeah uhuh it's page it's the end of chapter eighteen i think. yeah,  yeah maybe that's right. i think. so do you think we need to just foc- focus on like, the terms he says in lectures cuz there's like a lot of stuff in the book  yeah so  okay so why don't you tell me tell me what he has in your notes? and and, exac- like read verbatim what he has in your notes and then well first he has like operator and repressor and operons for prokaryotic, that's pretty much all he talks about is just the difference between those and he gives two examples one of the, trip operon w- it's on the next page he gives the two examples of the uh, eight- figure eighteen-point-nineteen, and then figure eighteen-point-twenty. eighteen-point-twenty? eighteen-point-nineteen eighteen-point-twenty   what page is that? he went over those two things three thirty-seven, three thirty-nine and that's really what he talked about with prokaryotes. it's just those two, different things. okay    oh that's a good question cuz i- like in this ques- i remember the question on the exam like, i knew the answer but i didn't, like their listed possibilities of,    it says  yeah some of the answers didn't make sense    okay it will always be bound unless, the um,     it's already bound.  yeah   what?   the beta (galactosidase) yeah the permease this thing, right? right  no if lactose is present you need that to break down the lactose. right. okay  mhm so the   and galactose? so if you have a_ if the glucose is present then it somehow, inhibits well the thing is that glucose can break down the lactose, so when the lactose is around it's like i need someone to break me down so it makes this and this stuff breaks down the lactose, and then it   right it just makes stuff to break down  oh okay so, then like another possibility was there would be an increase in the amount, well two of 'em there'd be an increase or decrease in the amount of lac repressor protein but when,  yeah i didn't know like when it, yeah   it's always gonna be there. that so it's never going to go  i don't th- i think that_ okay the way that it has it in this book, is that this thing it goes through or it's the lacI that produces that, repressor protein, mhm nope right it's always gonna be  right right,okay that's what_ i mean th- obviously_ it's    right       yeah like question  what's a    the_ or it's, either called the inducer depending on what it does. right  yeah i didn't   right  it induces the lac operat- lac operon to be transcripted right? mhm   okay okay so, you're saying that glucose is a corepressor? no wait what'd you just say is a corepressor?    mhm mhm   i get it i understand  okay  okay  right   what about that? i was just saying it goes into, eukaryotic after that.   just, pretranscriptional level, transcriptional level, all the different_ he went through all the different levels. okay so what's in the  go ahead like how in detail is he? cuz like in the, in the, prokaryotes there's just like, operons, right? right     mhm okay. i think that like, um pretty much the thing is that there, there are regulations everywhere in eukaryotic cells and in some cases like some um, regulation will occur at this level and some will occur at this level and some will occur at that level and all of it is a sort of a regulation. do you know what i mean? so like   okay. on that note i have a question about one of the regulations he talked about. okay um, at the transcriptional level he talked about, um this, and i kinda un- i un- i think i understand that but then he said that the_ because there are no operons and the genes are spread around, pathways need to be on at the same time, so the same segment in front of all those pathways needs to be on or something, it's like the last thing he said on the transcriptional level.   um say say it again. i guess i don't what do you  i don't know if they were talking about, or maybe they're talking about_ this is the way i i i kinda think (over) that, is that in like eukaryotic cells like, there's a lotta things that can affect just a production of protein, or like things like that like you m- several genes may code for like your hair color, right  mhm    okay let's  okay y- in the summertime you tan your hair gets lighter.  okay it's, yeah it's like um, this activator activates one thing for an operon like in in prokaryotes, mhm   but one    i think so okay um what's the purpose of enhancers? hmm i get what they are i just don't   i think it just, they just    i think    so, i- does he just_ like for the transcription level you should just know that, different from prokaryotes eukaryotes have transcriptional factors? transcriptional factors? that's something,  that's the only thing that's different? yes           you_ yeah i remember. you need like transcription of like, you'll learn all of this in biochem when you take it like there's like transcriptional factor like A B G D E F and like, they all bind at different times and blah blah blah blah blah like, real little annoying stuff.  i know. i'm like  yeah      yeah  yeah  right  enhancers aren't t- are those transcription factors? are there just_ they need transcription, cuz they need activators     they help bind transcription factors? yeah i think to the polymerase region it helps binding. okay and the transcription fac- that i- things transcription factors have to bind to enhancer. mhm enhancers help the transcription factor to bind to_ or so activators are transcription factors that  yeah right right  yeah okay. okay anything else in that? i think i was okay with that. (xx) um, for the post-translational level, mhm      after translation. after translation what's after translation you get a protein right? right right right  sometimes they have to be cleaved to work right they need to like oh like modified after.      yeah like it needs to g- go to the   right    will we just have to do the same thing for translational translational level? like it's,    you mean transcriptional? or p-  before transcription like  in the D-N-A itself right? right    okay. right. okay. so like those are pre-translational right? right  what we were  um splicing yeah splicing   right  you don't know need to know_ okay well whatever. like things like that that happen to the messenger R-N-A in order for it to  right  and then, once it's in the cytoplasm, now this R-N-A has to be turned into protein right? so now we have transcriptional or translational,       and th- the other thing is too is like to know what um each thing means like how how does it regulate? or like what does that what does like, D-N-A packing mean?  yeah and at the transati- uh translational level um, uh it just has to do with the difference in um translation initi- initiation is that right? or is there  okay alright wait  it's just like that, it's just like the um transcription, initiation complex there's also a translation and initiation complex  yeah okay so there are two okay, then we talked about gene development and reg- regulation. yeah, and it's it's kinda just common sense. yeah he was just kinda like going, kinda slowly through that   yeah he was just kind of like why are ce- multi-cellular organisms different? why does cuz they express different dream_   right, okay right that's that       the cytoplasmic determinants. oh yeah okay that's a good question. the cytoplasmic de- okay the maternal effect genes are those the cytoplasmic determinants or are those the genes that make the cytoplasmic determinants? i don't know, um okay    genes that are expressed by the mother, but they're carried by, everyone or something oh they're genes that like are already in the, egg before it's fertilized. that's right and they, okay i think, that they     they they transcribe the M-R-N-A, what was that?   cuz there was a que-      it's what? it's_ that would be maternal inheritance or whatever     i don't    yeah. yeah they make they     (fou-  it just, allows cells to,    is that true? no i put question mark i, i didn't quite hear what he said in class.  i i was     um, help me out where do you wanna like after gene cascade he said something like he was talking about the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the zygote, oh yeah i'm wondering, if it i don't know that's probably wrong i was just curious like what i was supposed to be writing. here here's  what happens like_ okay i guess my general question is okay there's gonna be two cells one has a lotta cytoplasmic determinants one has fewer what does it what does that mean? what happens to those two cells because     i think that just like th- i-    so that starts the gene cascade to like yeah  oh          because right. that was in the short answer wasn't it?        wait w- say that   alright so in the- in the- these flies, um it gets the bicoid gene from_ that's the maternal effect gene, right   it's a gene that makes an a- there's a there's a picture.           right right? right okay so these, um gene can be transcribed (xx) i bet you could see it from this figure. translated in another set? it's tran- i- he said in yeah        no you know what i don't_ i think i- i- he showed us this figure though and this figure says that.  this figure says okay so you have this developing egg, okay, um, first know that maternal effect genes don't they o- do they only control like the polarity of the egg, or do they do other things too?   i don't know for right? isn't that_ is that right? yeah, cuz they can also be called   yeah, yeah,   no that's okay. um... okay so,     okay     right     is that a cytoplasmic determinant?    right  oh it's just little M-R-N-As stuck down on one end of that thing and that  yeah and    right so what are cy- are cytoplasmic determinants specifically M-R-N-A? i think they're just things that cause, the cell to be different in different regions i don't think it defines it does it? oh. they're messenger R-N-A proteins and other substances in organelles. messenger     i don't like this short answer question.     really?    an exa- and example      which one?   provide an example what's the example? the example was like in prokaryotes the operons encode more than one pro- polypeptide, when the polymerase comes across it. that's right. that's right. what? um in prokaryotes the operons when they go along, the M-R-N-A, they make  no i think it d- makes more than one in eukaryotes, because of that whole like thing about the operons and the repressors and stuff that made all those different like made the, remember that picture he showed where it made the different, chemicals coming of off it? the different enzymes? remember that in the lactose picture he showed the different isn't question B and D the same things? B and D? yeah a single gene can produce, encode more than one polypeptide. a single mature M-R-N-A can encode more than one polypeptide, oh a mature M-R-N-A. right it's a little different. so what was the question in this one? or    wait how can    see here it's making these different polypeptides, this picture i'm talking about. where? in this picture it makes like, B-galactosidase and it makes permease and it makes  because it's prokaryotic.   right   what are you talking about? i'm sorry. like i don't understand how after translation, mhm  cuz, it's not, it's prokaryotic it's like,  you have to be careful when you say it's the same particular protein because your protein could be different than his but it still functions the same way. but like, do you see what i'm saying  mhm right   right  yeah,   so is that the only time when a single mature M-R-N-A can encode more than one polypeptide? i don't think it can happen in eukaryotes  it can't happen in eukaryotes.  sweet.  yeah let's, sub- just population genetics and all that right? yeah that's not too intimidating it's just a matter of being precise about terms i think. yep.  what page is it on? page uh, four-twenty-eight, in the book. i got that right here, i just forgot to look at it. hmm, (xx) that's okay (xx) Hardy-Weinberg  that's right this is where he comes into play. okay, this is really really_ i don't think this you guys have problems with this stuff do you? i- i have a question, but i gotta find it first. okay. you just need to pretty much uh,   actually,   no mine's like way in there it's on the last like the last lecture so, oh second to the last lecture. mine might be too. is it allopatric       right right uhuh  because we could never,    allopatric is like different different countries allopatric different places,        yeah yeah oh. okay that's why i didn't understand the difference like what's the difference    which one? which? sympatric speciation. oh it's not in this book but i remember it. is it on like page like, four-eighty-two? or, oh yeah autopolyploidy versus allo i don't get that either. i don't get any of that. i didn't understand it when he talked about it in lecture even. it's not in there is it? no okay. i think that has to do with speciation doesn't it? it says figure twenty-four-point-ten. to explain that    it's not as common because you're still you're s-  it's alright i don't i don't understand how it makes a reproductive barrier i know it's something about like haploids not being able, get it on with triploids or polypepti- poly- yeah poly-  what are polyploids? um,        okay  they can't. the donkey's infertile. oh. okay so autopolyploidy you, you'll f- that will be found in nonfertile species like oh  what did i say auto? you said  they would be not fertile? is that true?   well, they can't, reproduce have chromosomes from two species. it says it's more likely for asexual,  think of the donkey i always think of the donkey. yeah wait autopo- polyploidy's from  what does that mean? oh      hm wait i just don't understand it. i don't understand the reproductive barrier. it that just that, different species can't mate with one another? yeah, because i- yeah it's just that they can't like, what is a donkey (anyways?) they can't s- p- like,     mate they make a mule. donkey plus horse okay, cuz you never see like a herd of mules because that would   yeah   oh okay so the mule when it says that it's more likely if asexual reproduction is possible does that mean that if a mule can reproduce asexually then you'll have more allopolyploidy? cuz if it could reproduce asexually    yeah you don't, yeah when you do that there's no like, mixing of the s- the you have don't don't have any variation. you don't have   but i thought allopolyploidy's when you get two species to make  you're n- talking about the next generation  but i thought they are_ they're not fertile. that's the whole point,    right   mhm and then and then, in that way     well okay pretty          so sympatric speciation is just,  so then that's a, that's a post-zygote or that's a pre-zygote pre-zygote you don't have have a zygote right? so but like in allopatric it's cuz of like geography it's cuz of, cuz like      like even if  okay so what is that picture? oh     that was the allopatric speciations (were)     how_ where that divergence happens   wait what?   how new species arise so say right now we can all breed with each other and then something must happen to cause a reproductive barrier,   yeah it could also be like but can't people with Down_ Down's Syndrome is polyploid right? they can't mate with each other and produce viable offspring?  i never heard of that as an example but   yeah that's_ he put that up   he said we don't have to worry about this bottom part but   right. that's, allo, polyploidy. allopatric? oh allopolyploidy? yeah. oh  mhm (xx)  mhm mhm      mhm so all these just replicated but they didn't split up they all    right because this species can mate with like  right,  two of these? okay  right   okay    okay okay so that's your exam- that's an example of allopolyploidy. so then how would autopolyploidy work? wouldn't that just give you the same species? this is autopolyploidy. right that's what i'm saying.  no this is allo. okay this is i- in in auto if they're both from the same species wouldn't you just get more of the same species?  yeah oh, something happens     so uh figure twenty-four-ten.   a reproductive error i- it could be a reproductive bar- or it could be like a mutation, or an error that occurs during reproduction, that forms a new species. okay isn't that isn't that what you were saying is that like, somehow in the same place you form a new species  yeah right    yeah. but like,  unless you're asexual. it'd probably be rare unless it's asexual. that's    yeah    yeah that just happens. and from that mutation then you form a new species. just cuz mut- okay. because like i- and think of this as being like um, right okay. i think i have one more question. um, okay, the S-L-C's gonna close, um, i don't  do other people have questions? or i kinda wanna go over the exam.    okay. i think we should just move to a different place then okay. 	1
COL999MX040.json	i wanna welcome all of you intrepids who have managed to get up and and out today. i expect we'll have people joining us, throughout the morning. um, but i think we'll get started now. um, i want to introduce myself my name is Jane Hassinger and i am the, director of the Interdisciplinary Program in Feminist Practice. uh one of the, sponsors of this program today. um, it gives me a great deal of pride, a lot of pleasure, to see this event occur. and uh, i see it in many ways as, one of the, uh flowerings, of efforts, of a lot of people over a lot of time to create a community of scholars and practitioners um at the University of Michigan who_ whose feminism and whose commitments to social justice, um continue to, uh enhance and invigorate their work. n- uh just let me tell you a word or two about, the Interdisciplinary Program in Feminist Practice this project was, initiated in nineteen s- ninety-two, um with the intent of, uh helping faculty and graduate students become acquainted with the, significance of gender race and other aspects of social identities to their practices. and to their professional work. today's conference we- represents the work of graduate students, from multiple programs and departments, um with whom the Interdisciplinary Program has worked over the years. who have made a commitment to practice that holds to the principles of social justice and feminist values. as we will see today, these works, uh ask us to reassess the foundations of our work. the basic principles on which we do our work. both theoretical and practical. in order for us to illuminate the biases and the strategies that disempower in our practices. as well as allowing us to extend our gaze into the into the corners and beyond the borders of the problems that we address. rather than letting the borders, of our disciplines or our professions define and focus our efforts. these presentations will excite us about the promise of feminist multiculturally-competent practice. out in the professional workplace. they will also accent the essential values of praxis or the dynamic, interplay of engaging in action, reflection, theorizing and then back to action again, in collaboration with others. where reciprocity and mutuality are accented, and where, multiple sources of expertise and learning, are recognized, and respected. i know that today will invigorate us and draw us closer. today in our work_ our creative work and play. i'm so happy that you're here to help us celebrate these important works. i wanna pass the um podium now to, my colleagues Amy Zann and Kim Price. um well first of all we would like to start off by thanking a few people and organizations that helped uh make this conference possible um first of all we would like to thank the organizations for spon- who sponsored this c- um conference. um which are the Interdisciplinary Program in Feminist Practice, the Institute for Research in Women and Gender, the Women's Studies Program, the Horace Rackham School of Graduate Studies and the Office of Academic and Multicultural Affairs. there are also several individuals that we'd like to thank, uh first Jane Hassinger director of the Interdisciplinary Program in Feminist Practice, uh secondly and especially Nancy Quay, who we were going to ask to stand but she's already standing, i've been running around. also of the Interdisciplinary Program in Feminist Practice um, Nancy was really the glue that held this project together, and without her extraordinary organiza- uh we'd also like to thank the speakers h- for submitting such great papers and for presenting great papers and um we would like to um announce that the papers that are being presented here at this conference will be published by the Institute for Research on Women and Gender so Gender so if you're interested you should contact them to get copies um um of the papers actually gonna be published as part of their working papers series. and also we'd like to remind the speakers to turn in your papers and um your consent forms to Nancy Quay, um by the end of the day. just a few words about the planning committee um who we'd also like to thank. um we've been working on this project since January and it has been a long and and wonderful process, um, this conference was organized by graduate students from a variety of disciplines uh including political science, psychology, public health, the Romance languages, social work, and women's studies. um you'll notice that there are two of us up here and um that represents that this really is a group effort and um, we've done this together. um, i should mention also the committee's put together an evaluation, um there are multiple parts to it but this white sheet you got is the overall evaluation for the entire conference, uh once you complete this at the end of the day there's a little green table out in the hallway if you can leave it on? um, also this blue sheet is for any of you that wanna get involved in next year's conference uh to be part of the planning committee to, speak um, if you want to be involved just fill this out and also leave it on that green table. um, you've also received a copy of the program, it has the abstracts for all the talks in it, um and a full schedule... that's, okay okay um and we'd just sort of like to end by kind of talking about the um inspiration for this conference um, basically the inspiration for this conference was to uh recognize the importance of um feminist theory on um the professions and to explore the links between theory and practice um, we kinda wanted to honor um feminists at work, um students at work and (guess) responsible um practitioners whether they're in teaching or in research um in the practice disciplines or in the professions such as um business and law. it's also our hope that this conference inspires more creative feminist scholarship, more dialogue between feminists from different disciplines, and more connections um for women in this area. um last night's talk really inspired a lot of of of feeling and thought in me and a lot of discussions i think that are yet to be had, um and we hope that a support network of women from various disciplines develops as a result of this conference both last night's talk and today's presentations, um we encourage you to get together during lunch in order to meet and and begin some of these dialogues, and we hope you enjoy the conference. thank you for coming. we could  if that's okay with you... actually that works a lot better. (that does) (xx) i think_ my name is is Jean Moran and, um i organized this panel to, um examine ways in which feminism is applied in the physical sciences. and i think it's very exciting and very appropriate that the physical sciences and engineering are included in a conference on feminist practice. my interest in um, this area has really derived from my desire to integrate my feminism with my scientific work. and this really began for me as an undergraduate student, m- in an engineering primarily an engineering college, and i i studied nuclear engineering at that time and i kept my, feminist interest very separate from the work that i was doing. so um i was active in things such as sexual harassment sexual discrimination, and later uh domestic violence, but i did not necessarily integrate that with what i was i was studying in school, and in the questions i was asking in my research... over um the course of my time here at the University of Michigan as a graduate student, i i d- my field of study is medical physics which i do through the environmental (of) industrial, environmental and industrial health, in the School of Public Health. but i do my research in radiation oncology which is a clinical department which students aren't really a part of. um their primary goal is is tr- treating patients and training residents. when i first came to the university i participated in, um one of the seminars for the Interdisciplinary Program for Feminist Practice. and um Jane was part of that, initial um, experience where i found that, a lot of the women in other fields at that point_ ar- i didn't identify with what they were saying strongly and and they really didn't understand what my experiences were. so i would get comments in class about things such as you know wow you guys are really in the Dark Ages. and that's because the fields in which i, i practice is primarily male. um this year at the annual meeting of uh the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, there was a panel on women in the A-A-P-M which, is great progress, but um, you know there are eighteen percent women in this field. and so it's a struggle. um so after that initial experience, i wanted to actually talk to other women in the sciences. and because i was in a clinical department i did not have that experience of interacting with peers on a daily basis in my work. so at at that point i talked to Cinda-Sue Davis, at C-E-W and we formed a discussion group for women in the sciences and engineering. we read many different feminist critiques of science, and really found that as a group we felt these critiques came from women who were not scientists and who did not necessarily understand the science we were doing. and we struggled we really struggled to see how we could apply that feminism these articles into what we were actually doing. and um the group was compi- comprised of people from many different disciplines including mathematics, um, chemistry um biochemistry uh different forms of engineering, geology, and as a group we struggled through this process of self-identity really. and found that, many of us had to stop and talk about well what did we mean by feminism and did we wanna be identified as feminists? and i i think that's something that we'll see if we get into a little bit with the panel this morning. so that's really how how we got to this point. great. well i'd like to thank Jean first of all for inviting me to be on this panel uh it's been quite an experience trying to gather my thoughts and and put them down for this presentation and it it's really made me think about my history and my evolution as a feminist and, when Jean and i were talking about this Jean said i'd like you try and to define what feminism means to you, and the more i thought about it the more i realized that it meant something different at almost every stage of my life and that it's still evolving i feel. i'm probably the oldest member of this panel and my growing up period sort of mirrored the growing up period of the Women's Movement or at least the current Women's Movement i know that the movement's been going on for, hundreds of years probably as well you can you can see it in the eighteen hundreds, um also. but when i grew up in the fifties, in Grand Rapids Michigan which is a very conservative, Dutch-based Christian-reform population on the western part of the state, women didn't work. they stayed at home at least the women i knew didn't work. and in fact i remember um, a elementary school teacher in my school who did return to work after the birth of a child and and what discussion that generated among the other parents um of my peer group. i was an only-child of older parents and my mother interestingly was very supportive of this woman, going back to work and she said she really didn't see what the problem was in fact it seemed ideal to her because when the child got into school the mother would be working and and the schedules would match very nicely. and in fact when i look back at influences of my own life it was really my mother who was continually telling me things and one of the things she told me was that you should never ever expect to have somebody financially support you. in your life you had to plan your life so that you would always be financially independent. now my father was almost twenty years older than my mother so i'm sure that she had in her mind at some point in her life she would again have to support me and indeed that was the case because my father died when i was in high school. (but) i think that was quite remarkable, for a woman of the nineteen fifties to be telling her daughter that you you had to have a career. and if it was_ if you did find a partner and you could share resources that was really nice but don't count on it cuz that may or may not happen. also when i, started showing an interest in science every time i would express an interest in a particular career she would always urge me to look higher than that. uh at one point i said, gee i think i would like to be a nurse and she s- she sort of laughed and said well you've never been able to take an order in your entire life you better be a doctor. mhm mhm okay, thank you Cinda. um, Joyce Yen is going to speak next, um she is currently a graduate student in the industrial and operations engineering department, she received her undergraduate degree in mathematics, and she's currently director of the graduate uh chapter of the Society of Women Engineers. thanks Jean. um as Cinda was talking i was like oh my gosh i have to talk about that, it's catching  thanks Joyce sure okay our final speaker is Mary Brake. uh Mary studied, physics as an undergraduate at um M-S-U, and then uh continued on into graduate school, but then switched to engineering so that she could study plasma physics. she received her PhD in mechanical engineering in nineteen eighty-three from M-S-U, and, she works on plasmas, now um ionized gla- gases, that are used in manufacturing of microelectronics. (and) she also performs research on microwave produced plasmas, and she's an Associate Professor of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Science. okay thank you. um before i start i have to uh make a couple of comments in in I-O-E um actually they have a good record, of having a fair number of women undergraduates, mhm yes thanks Mary. okay we have about uh fifteen minutes for some questions and discussion... would anyone like to start? one of the things i noticed in a lot of your comments is uh, the amount of work that exists in the crevices, um that has to do with building community building relationships, being supportive of one another extending oneself, and that work not only is unrecognized but often works uh to your detriment you mentioned that Mary. uh, does that, does that get better as numbers increase? did that that problem of invisible work, that um some of us might regard as some of our feminist work you know making those linkages and and all. but i think we find in organizations that it fa- it's work that falls to women in any case. mhm that's true. well the the uh situation i was talking about was not all that long ago mhm that's great ah no   mhm mhm mhm and i might add to that um, when i was, complaining and really mad at everybody, i went to talk to Jim Duderstadt who was Dean when i was hired and, he basically hired me, and this is after uh he had stepped down uh as President and this wasn't too long ago and um, he said uh, Michigan is a conservative place and he said but you know what Mary, most most engineering schools at least most other universities, uh, that are you know the same tier as Michigan, are the same way. it's like ooh this is not good to hear, but that's what he told me and as someone who's been President and, uh, seen a lot of other universities yeah i think uh, our our graduate group um, were were highly valued in the college because of the, the services mhm yes yes, mhm mhm they don't graduate five these numbers are high, right right so and and only if you take all of those people, and then uh and then those who are willing to, actively participate then you get enough of a critical mass to do something, but um and grad s- SWE has grown i don't know if you realize this mhm right right yeah it started in ninety-four, ninety-four i think or something like that? um   um Joyce so what what is the mission of grad SWE? um yeah we do have a mission and the mission is um, it's basically to foster support and um, interdisciplinary connections for women both w- for all students but in particular women to to help sustain the women's experience, and then to provide, opportunities where there can be, this cross- cross-discipline exchange, whether it's academic or social, um okay so it's both i was struck by your comments that most of the, application of feminist work is actually, not so much in your research and in the science but in the administration of the departments and in your relationships, and i'm in, medicine and i find that, you know the science itself is socially constructed the_ so the science reflects all of the, the social problems yet science sees itself as objective and a closer mirror of the truth, than humanities and, in humanities and social science people can take the practice principles mhm that that's a very good question. that's the ultimate question,  right right  mhm yeah a- actually i would like to to make a comment, if that's okay. um, actually i found a quote that Cinda had had sent to our, our Women in Science and Engineering group, when um, we were first, starting, and, and this really focuses a lot um on_ i_ because i do believe there is a feminist science and that, um in our discussions we, we don't_ we didn't believe as a group that, okay a feminist science meant that, you didn't actually have to do science that you could say oh well i i feel like you know the atoms, interact in this way and therefore that's the way it is and when i was in graduate school it was actually referred to as the trinity. mm yeah   i think uh in my in my f- in industrial and operations engineering a lot of is um production manufactured base which is in my view very boring but, um, some of the some of the things like last_ a couple weeks ago we had a seminar on a woman, um who is, uh in one of the California schools and she is doing her work which is mathematical modelling of H-I-V policies um like uh, educational policies uh you know should you do more, more um, like just, really general informational work on uh how H-I-V is spread or should you do high impact work and like ho- how to quantify those and and make uh policy decisions in um uh on that sort of work um also there's um, movements w- uh included in my department is also um sort of, um organizational behavior work organizational behavior and um there's, there's movements in in that field about um, as opposed to, a hierarchical, work organizational structure and moving to a more um, horizontal, uh work organizational structure which i think is also, very much attributed to women's ways of work and women's ways of organizing, so Kristy i have a question regarding like the label of feminist um, as a student in the nuclear engineering department and working in the same clinical department as Jean, i really welcome the opportunity to go to like, women-based science and engineering forums and conferences, and stuff like that, and normally i get a lot of support from both my male friends and my female friends of going to like, a conference on you know women in science and engineering and stuff like that but when i said i was going to a feminism in the workplace everyone was like, a what? you know it was like you know they_ immediately i think they got this picture of all of us you know with like, big signs you know like women rule  what's    mhm can you can you give us the title of the book? Women in Science. oh also um, yesterday w- we were talking in Kay Hagan's um, keynote address, she um, made light of the fact by by presenting ten factoids that um, of what feminism is presented as by the media, and part of that is to to keep, new women away i think mhm what what do we need to do to change the future, um so that as the next generation comes forward, our girls from age ten to sixteen can be encouraged, um without all of this scary exclusion around technophobia and things like that, what do we need to do to get the n- the next kids ready, um so that they can become scientists without the barriers? um one of the things that um, i talked about briefly, which is what_ one of the things that i'm working on in the college, is um, is giving people, scientists now, graduate students now who are going to be out, in the work force either in a- in research positions or in academic positions having children of their own, i- i- giving them formal training on, on creating collaborative environments giving them formal training about communication skills and how i- how it's okay to to do all these, sort of, softer skills in their heads which are not hard science but which actually are very relevant to the work that they do, and and the ways that they present themselves and the ways that they interact particularly with women who, um, who would_ who might be more sensitive to, to the types of um, aggressiveness_ aggressive behaviors that they might_ that they're currently learning from their their their current mentors or the current environment that they've grown up in, and to teach them that, to teach them that, n- another way to do science is in a much more collaborative, environment where you encourage lots of new ideas and where, where everyone is welcome and, where you do encourage more women to participate and, and that sort of stuff so it's i mean it's a long ways away though like these are people who, who maybe for the first time they're hearing that you can ask a question in, such a way where y- your ego is safe and the presenter's ego is saved you know this might be the first time that they've heard that idea and so so um, i think it's, it's a slow but important um concept to work on. (but) i think it's a very complicated issue, mhm mhm wow i wonder too if we need to um, change to some extent work to change to some extent how, um, we think work is done. wh- when  mhm that's right that's right mhm mhm mhm mhm the history of science has always been that you have to be first. you have to make   but as Cinda said it's it's it's very complicated even with male students uh we have, um high school students come visit us in engineering and uh i remember talking to, uh different students and one in particular uh wanted to be in nuclear engineering and said but my parents don't think there's any jobs in it they really don't want me to go into that, so there's a lot of parental, uh education that needs to go on i know uh for a long time i w- i worked with the, undergraduate Society of Women Engineers, and i was amazed at how many of them had fathers who were engineers and were alumni of the University of Michigan so it was okay for them, um so there's_ needs to be parental education, and having just studied secondary ed i can tell you science teachers uh, need some education. uh when i did my student teaching with, um, a physics teacher who was very good, but he had some strange ideas about things despite the fact he had a daughter who was in junior high at the time, when we went to study torque he said oh boy i'll bring in my torque wrenches, the only thing i can think of using a torque wrench for is to put in spark plugs but i'm not real sure about that and i said, nobody does tune ups anymore it's too complicated don't bring it in, and he said well i try and do girl stuff i i talk_ i tried to talk about pressure cookers yeah i'm reading this book on women mathematicians and um, every single person in this book, they talk about the mentors that they had and the people who allowed them to study science and, the people who who's mother or father or who's father was a chemist or who's father was_ who's mother you know didn't work but like, encouraged the woman to go on and ask more questions and uh every single one of them, succeeded because they had somebody who was mentoring them mhm mhm okay well it's time to um take a brief break and then move on to the next session, so i'd like to thank everyone for attending and, thank Mary Joyce and Cinda 	1
STP355SU010.json	five slots here for each group, you put their names and their topics uh on the top there, you don't have to put your name on this one, okay? uh and what all i want you to do is kinda go along a continuum okay? where you think it is excellent so i don't need an absolute. i'd also like a comment or two underneath it you know clear not clear you know, shoulda tightened up their experiment or something like that okay? underneath there. um, so you have the first little box for each group is presentation, okay? so that means, just the presentation now okay? did they do a good job, keep you awake? that kinda thing, mhm um i didn't_ we didn't, bring the video recorder so   oh, but did you ask them? yeah yeah oh consent forms, all right there. okay okay. okay? should we say our names first? should we say our names first so they can put 'em on the sheet? oh, sure okay, so you guys can put our names on the sheet my name's Lindsay i'm Mir-Soo, M I R S O O i'm Kelly okay i'm sorry one other thing when you're almost thirty minutes i'm gonna tell you okay? you finish okay don't just, stop at that point but you know you have to wrap it up okay? um well thank you for being present for our presentation and um, um our project is about, is a combination of cross-sectional, studies and pragmatics, and well through this class we all know that there are, excuse me, there are many kinds of speech acts such as uh requests, complaints di- disagreements apologies corrections and refusals. and what we're gonna do today is about refusals. and uh just to let you know what kin- what kind of studies there have, been, um, till, now, um, i think, there hasn't been a lot of studies on refusals which is, i don't know why but maybe it's because it's such a complex area, but anyway, i found two studies that are, quite related to what we're going to do today and one of them is, by Beebe Takahashi and Uliss-Weltz, and it was done in nineteen ninety, and uh, they compared Japanese and American refusal strategies, in order to present evidence of pragmatic transfer in Japanese E-S-L learners' refusals. and the result was that, they had, evidence of transfer in both Japanese and American (xx) okay sorry about that, okay they found evidence of transfer, and um, what they found was that both Japanese and Americans favored the strategy of using, an ex- an excuse and showed a tendency to begin the refusal with refusal (adjuncts) such as positive opinion. and uh the second one is, the second study is by, (Tree,) i think he's Chinese and um, he did a study on English refusal strategies in business situations, and, it was based on mainland Chinese and Taiwanese E-S-L learners, and native speakers of American English. and, s- the results were similar to the former study by um Beebe Takahashi and Uliss-Weltz and excuse was the most frequently employed strategy by all three groups and um all three groups preferred specific excuses, but both Chinese groups were more familiar_ family oriented oriented when making excuses, so um, that's uh, studies that been done on refusals. for the hypothesis we took as a starting point the Beebe study which was actually mentioned in our book, and, uh, it's on page one f- one eighty-five but i'll just read what, his bottom line was. he was studying um, as she said semantic formulas, for examples excuses expressions of regret apologies, we've redefined those terms a little bit and in a few minutes we'll show you what terms we came up with. his conclusion though was that, the range of formulas that are available, is the same, for all speakers, the difference is that the order of the formulas is different, between non-native speakers and native speakers. so we, we didn't really, we weren't very convinced about that so we decided to test, a different hypothesis. which is that in our our situation which was refusing an invitation, um the range of formulas that are actually available to non-native speakers is much more limited than the range of formulas available, to native speakers. with a consequence, that non-native speakers will frequently respond inappropriately, in status governed interactions. when we discuss the test you'll see that we were controlling for status in the two tests that we used... um i'm gonna tell you a little bit about the population that we studied, um, we had ten native speakers which they were all undergraduate students here at the University of Michigan, and then we had seven non-native speakers, two of which were Korean, two of which were Spanish, Spanish and three of which were Chinese, and um among them, they had all been in the U-S between three months and a year approximately, and it was a mixture of graduate and undergraduate students, and they were all um between the ages of twenty and thirty, and we also had a mixture of males and females. put the front light out, okay? this one? yeah put it_ bring the machine, back this way... now that's as good as it's gonna get unless you can (bring it back) okay um well this is uh put out the other light, let's just okay what we did was um, send out emails well that one comes out i mean maybe if we mhm... well i'll just move it as i read it... so um here are the actual email responses we got and we picked out some of the good examples that represented each of the categories, and for acceptance, um this, person says i would definitely go if, even if i didn't want to, various reasons, uh blah blah blah  there's a mix so all you're doing here is picking out  the most clear-cut, yeah (to)  can i just clarify something? sure go ahead sure. um i just wanted to clarify that, s- sorry, when we began, we didn't anticipate all of these categories, we didn't anticipate acceptance, uh the email was worded it didn't say that they had to refuse it just said you don't want to go. so we did have some people accept, for varying reasons, uh we didn't anticipate avoidance, which later surprised us because it's a pretty common tactic, this ch- i never got your email, sort of thing, and we had expected to see some straight refusals from non-native speakers thinking that limited l- language or pragmatic knowledge might lead them to be more blunt. but we didn't have that result so (there) were two things we got that we, didn't expect and one thing we expected that we didn't. okay, now we're gonna talk about the results a little bit of what we, ended up seeing... so, was it was it clearer up there? can we  make it smaller but... (it's gonna need to be higher) RESTRICTED why? RESTRICTED  great okay yeah_ oh, well they're locked, but i'll bring the linguistics one okay? let's see how do i do this? i don't think so can i ask a  sure yeah one thing i'd like to clarify that actually i didn't even think of is they don't add up to a hundred percent i don't_ is that what  um a lot of the speakers, and you can see from this, used um, more than one type oh uhuh okay great. anything else? are you finished or are you? no. oh okay you can leave that on actually oh okay,  oh, sure and it was a non-native speaker (we're assuming?) it was a non-native speaker. yeah oh but the thing is i mean she's Korean and i don't think even if i i mean even if she was responding to a Korean professor and, friend she w- i wouldn't use a re- excuse, like this i mean it's really embarrassing to tell anybody that i have diarrhea, and, well i was trying to get hold of her and ask why she had such a (xx) response but i couldn't s- but i couldn't contact her so, i don't know it just remains a mystery it is good though, it's great to sorta you know pick up on something like that do you know her is she a joker? yeah and the thing is she, does have diarrhea very often so she had it planned for next week already... this poor woman okay. well um if we were to do this experiment again had a couple things that we would change. um the first thing that we would make different is the um the letter format itself. we we had some problems with that um, we tried to make it clear that we wanted them to respond, as if they were responding to a professor, and not tell us how they would respond but a lot of people did that. if i were to respond to this i would tell them this, instead of just saying, i can't make it or, whatnot. um so we thought one thing that we would change is we would make it a specific date and time and say that, you don't wanna go or you can't make it we would say, dear so and so, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, this time this day, sincerely, your friend or your professor, instead of saying please respond if you had received it. so that's one thing we woulda changed, and then the other thing we would've changed is we would've ended up sending the scenario to both, um, (or) both scenarios to everyone, um, the reason that we did that as Mir-Soo said in the first place, was um, we were afraid that people would um, see what we were doing. they would see oh here's a professor here's a classmate, i'm supposed to do a different response here instead of controlling for that variable, but we ended up, uh uh two people i believe, um responded that they would say the same thing, to the professor and a classmate they said this is what i would say either way, and no one seemed to catch on to what we were doing so we we might as well send both scenarios to everyone, and have more data. sure did you get native speakers, saying that they would respond the same way? yeah was one native and  one native and one non-native, which is actually yeah very surprising, but the person who, said that she would say the same thing to both actually um, she was the one that lied right?  yeah um she she said that she would wait she would say she would go up until the last day, and then she would email and say some plans came up RESTRICTED  did you look at all at um, the amount of time they had spent in the States, and what kind of responses they used? yeah um, that was_ in the population everyone had been here about three months to a year, so they were all basically in the beginning of learning pragmatics no one was, extremely advanced, so that was basically controlled for. do you think that the, appropriacy or inappropriacy of responses or (basically just) how they the candidates responded, do you think that was due to, a lack of pragmatic knowledge or do you think it was more maybe due to a lack of, uh language knowledge (like uh) they wanted let's say they wanted to make a, justification but they didn't have all the vocab down, so they went with, (uh) what they could say, with vocab they did have. well we talked about that a little bit didn't we and i think we decided that it didn't constrain  okay how do you think your results would've changed if, this was a spoken situation? spoken situation it's interesting because a lot of the research that was done has actually been on speaking, and they focus um that's where the bulge theory comes that there is a lot more negotiation between, people that um don't know each other very well, that's it um, so if the status is not as unclear it takes several conversational turns before you get anywhere, so partially because of the scope of the study we chose to do it as a written, thing so we we wouldn't have all that variation... i mean uh do you think would've been more limited in their responses to non-native speakers if they would've had a spoken situation, where they had to come up with it quicker? that would be interesting to see my reaction would be yeah, i think that's a very good point, although it is still interesting, even in that, modality that you used you got a real limited, uh scope of the kind of answer or more limited not real limited but, um, you know you might get more limitation you know in that but it is an interesting question. and even at that issue of, sending something someone else in the E-L-I just did a a task where she wanted the students to write down what they would say, it just it's so difficult for all of us not just non-native speakers but, you know to get into that mode and really just do it that way it's it's a very difficult task. that's initially one reason why we chose email, because we that it was a naturalistic situation you really might get an invitation you really might respond through writing, but i think as as Lindsay mentioned, uh, we we_ perhaps should directly just given em the letter. okay i think, very nice uh, can we have some more evaluation sheets around? we seem to be, out of them. a little hard for me to believe that. i know usually it's (overmade things) extra evaluation forms. our names are here you can, Portia Leah and Marta, and um... um the use of closures by native speakers, and non-native speakers, and, we're trying to say how th- how are they alike or different. um our project design, um, basically we collected data on the pragmatic element of closures, the end of conversations, and the task, was to complete the questionnaire that you have in front of you, and we were wondering_ well, we wanted you, complete in maybe three minutes, try to go through it and see what would you what would you answer, some of the questions and before you start. from Professor Johnson this side, do the third and fourth question first, and you guys can do it in the order that it was given. okay so we have eight native speakers and eight RESTRICTED yeah, jus- RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED (xx) RESTRICTED you have one three two but you have A B C D RESTRICTED yeah we mixed them up because, then you will have, two lines three lines four lines and we thought they may, kind of, be given out the answers if you put it that way RESTRICTED except those (non-native) speakers RESTRICTED cuz no one picked A right? (native speakers) oh i did RESTRICTED okay for questions three and four we tried to set up a context that um, both native speakers and non-native speakers'd be familiar with for question three we talked about, meeting with a professor for office hours and for question four it was about saying, goodbye when um a friend is leaving at the airport, and um for question three, we tried tried to find some, generalizations about, um, some of the, ways that, native speakers and non-native speakers close, um for non-native speakers it was a lot more common for them, to avoid the closing like, um, the professor would say, well if it'll just take a few minutes then we can do it now, so then they never even had to say goodbye, or deal with that at all, um, see you seems to be pretty universal, pretty universal, native speakers and non-native speakers alike used that one a lot, see you see you later see you tomorrow, but only the native speakers used see you tomorrow, um, they were more specific about time in general like, three of the, native speakers um said i'll see you at one o'clock, set a specific time for the meeting, um thank you and okay were basically only used by native speakers i'm not sure why non-native speakers weren't, as familiar with those expressions. um... for question four... our hypothesis would be, to expect the dialogue of the form four and that it would be produced more often by the native speakers than by the non-native speakers, and we definitely found that to be true... um, this chart right here, um you can see that the non- er the native speakers, used form four fifty percent of the time which made sense because this was with the close friend who's leaving at the airport and you'd expect it, to be a longer dialogue where they're, talking and saying goodbye, for a longer period of time, although native speakers did in a couple cases use the shorter forms, um, but those were a lot more common with the non-native speakers, uh we don't know if it's just because, um, it doesn't seem like a cultural thing it seems like in most cultures you would have a long goodbye with a close friend, so we figured it was just, more simple for them to have a shorter closing when they were writing that. um, and a couple other things we found were, appear that, the native speakers used a lot more, nonverbal, when they were writing it down they would use exclamation marks or underlining for emphasis, or um they would allude to physical contact like in parentheses it would say, they hugged they waved they kissed goodbye, and um, the non-native speakers those would be, expected of concentrated on the verbal, probably that's as much as you know, they could handle they didn't want to go into, further nonverbal things. um, this was something interesting we found, was that um, in a couple cases the non-native speakers and in one case the native speaker, instead of writing a dialogue format as we had asked in the instructions, they wrote it in narrative format like only one person spoke it was just a couple lines of one person speaking, um, but this only happened in cases, where, they answered the open ended before the multiple choice, um, when the multiple choice occurred first, they would always use dialogue because it's like they had an example beforehand, when they read the multiple choice it's like here's some examples of dialogues, and they kind of followed that when they um, wrote the mul- er the open ended question. RESTRICTED yeah open RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and that takes us to the conclusions, which, we reached two one for the no- native speakers and one for non-native speakers. for native speakers we said that in general, they used closures appropriate with the context of the situation, and uh, with non-native speakers, and, we kinda base our, conclusions more on the open ended questions than on the, multiple choice questions just because the results were not, that different, and we thought that by writing it, it took them a little bit, longer to come up with a form, so, by th- by the writing part we concluded that in general non-native s- uh speakers, did not use the appropriate pragmatic form in the open ended questions, especially those that completed the, multiple choice open ended questionnaire. (are there?) no. multiple choice.  (kind of dull) RESTRICTED thank you see you, okay RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED okay i'm gonna talk about how our project could be improved, um in the instructions... it said in this part you will write a dialogue for each of the scenarios, and as i said before, some people did not write dialogues they just wrote a small kind of narrative form, so maybe, it_ phrasing it differently, like saying, um please, do this instead of you will do this, just  okay in terms of the format of the questions we thought we could provide more informational context. the reason for that is we had one Russian subject who was a visiting professor, who was a little bit upset with the way we, phrased this for him_ he didn't answer almost all the questions, he kept writing that we didn't have enough informational context, um, for example on question two the multiple choice he says  which we thought we did but maybe it wasn't specific  RESTRICTED well taken and, we thought maybe we could (task) we could alternate open ended and multiple choice questions, or to do surveys which is all open ended on one and all multiple choice on the other, because it did affect it when we, did it one way or the other. some people didn't write in dialogue form if they hadn't seen it an example of it first so, maybe we'd take that into consideration the next time and the other one we had that, i just noticed is not there is uh using three different levels of proficiency, because um in the, article that we read um it says that even very proficient second language learners still, have problems with pragmatic concepts so we would like to, see how they are really different any questions? RESTRICTED did you take sex into account with your, results? RESTRICTED this, because intuitively i i i've no basis for this but i think that women probably draw things out more RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i was just thinking another thing you might look at is, if there_ if they choose short answers all across the board it might h- have something to do with personality RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED and i did the, um, non-native speakers surveys, but um, and, it was after a class, and they were really into it and they, they wanted, all of them to finish so i could say what was the purpose of it, they_ you know they were not in a hurry to finish it and actually the, because when when they saw the the, surveys, we were concerned that the Russian, student didn't write anything but he was the last one to turn it in so it was not even lack of interest, he was, really into it, so RESTRICTED did you find any difference with the, um, modality as far as, whether they were talking face to face or the telephone cuz i know there's some cultures you don't say goodbye on the telephone. like Russians wou- don't say goodbye on the telephone but yet they'll stand there for four hours and say goodbye at the train station RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED but i i think that sort of what, people are feeling what Magdalene was talking about and related to Philip and (xx) and i'm trying to think did we ever talk about doing a telephone, i mean rather the longitudinal thing some some pragmatics really, it doesn't seem that it it takes on a paper pencil. now the other one because we do do invitations, on a um, email at times there's some reality to that situation, but closure that the kind of closure you're looking for is i think very difficult to come by on a printed page RESTRICTED 	1
SEM495SU111.json	(what) the language of different disciplines is, and it's actually i think a very interesting project. uh, and so, they needed some political scientists to join in, they (had been) taping in various other kinds of, courses. and you may actually even run into this in some of your other courses as well. okay let's see, today, um, well before we even start with today, we have briefings next week, we're all set i hope, i mean, i understand you're still working away. someone who was it who was going to take (care of you?) no, (xx) i think (xx) i think it was Chandra. Chandra? Marker.  okay, but she's not here today. so you need to be sure, okay mhm okay i have to tell the class about it. ah. okay.    yeah okay (as long as you) feel comfortable (xx) okay so let's take a little break here for a minute. for the three groups, uh, the group that you're involved with is, is, gonna be set because you're making the reservations. yeah like i mean i and i have a laptop, so you're gonna use your own laptop yeah i have my own laptop so, like cuz you can also get one if, other people need  'em you can get one, on loan too. right but how 'bout the other people in your right okay, but you're gonna coordinate your group. yeah, i g- i mean yeah   but yeah i mean, whatever other people wanna do. okay, and you are which group? the, um Congress and higher  we are, okay.  i don't, know. i th- i think we're we're probably not going to use it. mhm okay, so you just need to work out okay that's fine then. right. uh, who's in the practice, group? we are. um, we've talked about using it and i, have a laptop so that's fine. you have a laptop. yeah, but i would need to go,   it's   yeah like yeah okay   it's actually, really good practice when you're making an oral presentation before a group to do a dry run. mhm.   courts, right. and, what about we haven't really discussed it yet. okay so you need to make a decision, okay   uh coming back to, the comments on your papers, which i will hand out at the end of the, class. um, i think that it is really important for any graduate, any university graduate and certainly any university graduate in the University of Michigan, to have good writing skills. i think, that, um, one improves one's writing skills all through life. you know it's not something where, a person takes a test and you know you can write, above some threshold and then sometime you stop. uh i, i always get people to read my drafts, and they always, uh make improvements, in in the drafts.   um, (excuse me) my main, the main thing i focused on, i'm trying to remember what  the the main drawback that i, believe (with) the distance learning is the uh, that you, lose out on the experience of going away to school. and it's not going away to school, the me- (maturation) process which occurs from, sitting in classrooms even if you're a commuting student. um, by having, you know the professor, in front of the room saying this is due on Tuesday or whatever the it's it, forces you to uh, it it makes it more concrete, as opposed to if you see it online it could see, it could seem almost uh, secondary it could seem what if i run a video? say, your paper is due on Tuesday. (if) you're in the classroom setting still with other students, it's uh, there's still the f- the academia feeling, and uh, it's a different feeling. mhm  mhm  who else wrote about last week? (there was) at least another, one or two. last week's readings, aw, c'mon (who else?) everybody else in here? somebody must be missing because i think i had uh i wrote this week. you wrote this week? hm, okay, (xx) another one well then let's start. so let's switch off over to this week then since you are obviously such budget, fanatics. no i okay um, well, to understand the limitations, and to become more, critical in your own thinking about, uh conclusions that people draw simply from numbers without understanding, necessarily underlying processes. so, some of you, uh, went that extra mile and brought in, other information, beyond the budget, or the c- or the uh uh course guide, to try to, nail things down a little more. some of you, uh limited yourself well some of you looked at the budget but looked at it in multiple ways, kind of, testing out your ideas. uh, and some of you, uh just looked at the budget, and some of you hardly looked at the budget at all. see i think i did mine on the wrong article i did i ch- i confused my twenty-first and twenty-eighth reading and did mine on Duderstadt's article. you were the person who wrote about last week i knew yeah okay alright no Duderstadt yup i think if i could interrupt you for a second   and even within the context of race and ethnicity i mentioned the uh, the affirmative action lawsuits against the admission policies of L-S-and-A and then the law school, and how the ramification would not only be felt by Michigan but also by uh other campuses within the Big Ten, and but in particular i think it was the ninth circuit, district where we're part of all i think all of the Big Ten schools are a part of, and how, whatever decision_ let's say it was a it was a negative decision against, uh the the, the uh the university how it may alter it may, uh, make, universities less likely to pursue, admission policies that have target ethnic minorities or racial minorities or even those who are underrepresented or, disadvantaged. so um, however it comes out it  right  now why, actually it it's called C-I-C, and it includes all the Big Ten plus Chicago, and we get together, you know to talk about this event. why would a suit, directed at undergraduate admissions, and the law school, have an impact on, PhD production? which is, the number, that um, has been cited here.    yeah. what do you think? don't you need to you have to do undergrad before you do PhD. yeah, absolutely there's a, uh you know that's right, fewer people and what what else might happen? why are these things like_ you didn't actually link it right there'll be uh a skew in, in the type of information that is produced and in the type of research perhaps that is uh, that they partake in. why would that be? well if you, if there's a decrease in minorities for instance, in the undergraduate and then therefore there's a decrease in minorities then in the PhD program, there's less, research just by the the the trends, that have been taken. uh more people tend to do research that is pertinent to themselves, and so  by the way i think it's true. but, what, why, that's something_ that is what we would call, an empirical question. you know you could go out and find out, you could you could go out and find out what people study and it is_ a- and the reason i ask you this by the way is that it's, this is an assumption that people make that can be deeply offensive to peop- to, the people mhm mhm mhm oh well i took a class, uh last semester, um, African American intellectual thought and the majority of the class was based on, um, i guess, well, i guess the majority of the class was, was focused on whether or not, uh African Americans in higher ed should focus their, self but um, but not whether they do  mhm right right. mhm well maybe not w- i mean  they determine (xx) (concerning) interest. yeah um, maybe because they would consider it a more hostile environment? right right maybe, so maybe they wouldn't come to a place that lost a suit on that issue. what else? yeah? it may th- it may even deter a student from even d- like, pursuing a undergraduate degree in whatever it is that you that you want to study (what points at you,) uh decide to enroll in a PhD program. so, let's say you want to do a PhD in political science well, if you don't, i don't know, if there's a lawsuit against not so much a lawsuit but, it may deter you from actually pursuing the undergrad degree in, in that political science before you can get to the PhD level so right this is the same point you got fewer undergraduates so you got fewer people who are prepared to go into the PhD program. possibly um law schools would be, more apprehensive about taking the affirmative action route that they usually do in undergrad and actually start, refusing more minorities. law school yes we've got a suit against the law school if they lose they're gonna have to change the way they do, business. but what about, PhD programs in L-S-and-A or, graduate PhD programs in engineering or, business  it will chill out, basically what yeah yeah okay uh, the next one i i kinda, oh i think we'll stop  that would be, um, myself, i guess, to start. um, as far as the budget assignment goes before i say anything else i will say that this was like the most confusing thing i have ever done i believe. well it's not just his house but, yeah.      one i didn't i don't know. you didn't tell  it is it's a  two hundred thousand i believe nah it's not even two hundred thousand. where's that at again? it is on page, two. it's on page ten of the budget. yeah. okay. okay page two-sixty-five in the coursepack. (okay) (oh) i'm sorry. yeah it's actually_ ten gives you the total. but then when you look you have to go past all the schools and colleges right? yeah wait hold on. and you keep going (and we search) office of    right? what does transfers (mean.) that's another question. what?   oh okay,  oh they do the   now why  why is that like the only thing listed for office of the president is like, well right  right. yeah.   (damn)   okay, it's starting to make sense now.   okay. now in the very  (what did) i write? that was the next one. but the  thirty million. thirty million? no provost and vice-president for academic affairs about seventy million right? alright, now, my question on that one, is that there are all of these offices, right.  okay (what's this thing?) ah yeah. mhm right now is that, currently E Royster Harper? no.  Nancy Cantor, mhm then it's it's guaranteed okay okay. okay? so then, cuz they have one listed, like it says, that this is the academic support units and lists all these, and then it goes_ do you know what i mean? like it says this and it  and then yup. well no no, it's not listed under one. this is a note, okay okay  are athletic scholarships separate? athletic yes. okay i was just curious. so... i- somebody knows but i don't know what the real number is. well maybe nobody knows actually, um, chances are nobody knows what the real number is to tell you the truth. because, the endowments keep changing. right.   so okay  and then is that all the offices as well? yeah all those offices so Royster Harper is within, she's  she's within there. she is the interim, uh, vice president for student affairs. student affairs to      okay. oh we gotta go back to that  okay. she is the vice president for student affairs, (do you)  and that line has, nine million. and then do you see, right below that is the executive vice president chief financial   yes it is yeah  ambulance  okay now question. in these, budgets, yeah yes, uh huh  s- so  it, it should be included in that  and is that of the one million number? in that one million  (xx) like with with his, um, with his budget, does that include like does he get one base salary or does he get a salary because he's the president and then something in addition because he's a professor? no, gets a salary because he's the president but he does get, (housing) car yeah i i like the house.         question about the salaries um, i know in the past in a, lot of universities the highest paid professors are actually medical school provexors professors? yeah Gill Omens um,  yes, now the thing that you need  he's the head of neurosurgery or something?    mhm yeah (but) he's a, med school professor. um, the salaries that are reported in the newspaper do those include outside, yeah  they are correct for what they are. now what they are, (oh my god) the base hm right oh  except for Bo Schembechler yeah except for Bo Schembechler. he's the  no, no they don't?   i was getting upset. she was getting really upset. well the athletic department, what i said about that was um, there is a lot of money spent on athletics but the athletics make that money back. right. that's outside  right by the way, it's a perfectly reasonable question, it's just that you know you do need to get things in, right  right. you always have to  right i was thinking that, the special interest groups, yeah yeah now they actually, uh, they're working oh yeah, i'll give (xx) yes. plumbing? so that's um, kind of like uh, earlier this week there was an article in the Daily, about the university moving Michigamua, right   well yeah yes yeah, things like that  where'd Bollinger get the money to give to the athletic department?  okay i okay no yeah cuz it like it,  right i was just wondering does any of the money that comes in through athletics go, anywhere else besides athletics? yes it_ well it supports intramural sports, okay    right  cuz i think it would be very interesting to look at, like what th- what athletics brings to um- brings to the university how much it contributes to the academic environment, right     (i was gonna) say that i think that, a lot of schools, especially in the Big Ten and big, athletic schools use their athletic departments, to promote recruitment, in terms of, um getting students, not just athletes, to come to their school. like during the Michigan Illinois football game, Illinois ran a commercial for, their school, and, the first shot was of the football team, next couple shots of the football team, next shot the basketball team, then they showed um graduation, and then they showed another shot of the football team and they said, (right) right... some of us get a little agitated  yeah well, but i mean that's like, but i mean that's like the main, draw of a university for some people. right  you know, that's some of it but have you ever gone up to somebody i've almost stopped doing this who has a Michigan sweatshirt on and said go blue and they look at you like you're from mhm mhm go blue  back home in uh California we, joke my parents are both alums so we, we joke about real Michigan shirts and, fake ones and the real ones are kind of like this where it's just blue with the yellow Michigan, and you can pick out who actually went to Michigan yeah    but that's everywhere though.  yeah  yeah, but  no  yeah and i- i you know i think Dave, i- when he talked about this after making this argument, and sh- and, putting in some evidence goes on to say yeah um, well i thought it was interesting i was looking at the summary, um and the discrepancies between, the different colleges and, their different populations, and how does that correlate to what kind of funding they're getting? and, i looked_ i just compared L-S-and-A to, one other school_ i mean you can compare it to all of them and i think that would be interesting if you had more time but, um i compared it to the music school just cuz that was easiest um, cuz i'm familiar with both. um, and i compared, their um, their instruction budgets as well as their scholarship budgets. and i found, great discrepancies between um, let me get my paper cuz, i don't have the numbers. the number of students that they have in those colleges and the amount of money that they're getting. for example um, the school of music last year enrolled nine hundred and sixty five students that's undergrad and grad. um, which was um, one eighteenth the number of students the seventeen thousand three hundred and seventy students in L-S-and-A. um, but the money they received was not proportionate to, the number of students um, in each school. um, even more um, interesting was the amount of scholarship money they were getting. the average, i mean if you break it down just by, the generic number of students, in the schools um and then mu- number the amount of scholarship money they're getting in the general budget. um it breaks down to the average school of music student would get, um just over three thousand dollars, whereas the average L-S-and-A student would get, three hundred and sixty-four dollars.  mhm mhm this was, this is an example, i don't want to embarrass Vanessa but of a very short paper that, was really, good. well written and well argued. uh lemme just uh, uh, uh, comment on a couple of things about the politics, of what's going on here... my predecessor as dean was, Peter Steiner. you never heard of him, he was gone long before you came. uh the, dean of the music school who just stepped down is, Paul Boiler. and, now he's stepped down and what's the new person's name is, (xx)     exactly but if you're talking, some people wanna talk dollars. other people wanna talk, dollars per student... or dollars, per something, okay? um, so you really do i think have to talk dollars per student. now when i say that i say that because, i'm a member of L-S-and-A. (me) yes, so this relates to what you you were arguing uhuh then there's there's also the other pressure, like you know i guess administratively, of the fact that in-state students bring in, i mean out-of-state students bring in more tuition dollars. a mhm it is,  not the courts er, oh it was, the legislat- er you know the courts can't do this,  oh i guess so, so i guess we cho- like, we  they can't write a law so it's like i guess we chose to but,  no, there's the we got pressure    eight percent eight percent  something like that. it's something ridiculous (xx) why does Michigan do this? one, because for many years, the quality of the students, applying from out-of-state was higher. and we could get a better student body if we allowed if we admitted more. now, it's almost indistinguishable. so that's not, why we, would do it necessarily now but for years, i- there really was a gap. and there might be a little gap now sometimes but you don't when you're looking at the, the last few in-state versus the last few out-of-state yeah? would diversity play into it too? you know what i'm saying cuz like,    oh  the total percentage is what is important. alright.    right  well i think they care about engineering does Michigan reserve a certain amount of seats for in-state students in, like medical school and law school? cuz i was reading in a bunch of other schools especially (as it pertained) to law school that like a school like Virginia, reserves seventy-five percent of its seats for in-state students.  mhm mhm where does most of the in-state money_ you know the the i mean the, the state money go? does it go more towards an obviously undergraduate then than graduate? you know what i'm saying because there's they give a like lump sum don't they? so, right well, you saw the size of that general fund budget right? that's where the state money goes. and there's like nine hundred ninety-eight million (or something in there?)   (xx) mm. and you see the state, the state, let's see, the state appropriations is about three hundred and forty million. the student fees there was a year, i don't remember when it was like within the last five or six or, seven years when, student tuition and fees passed state appropriations it used to not be as big, believe it or not. but now you can see the student tuition of these four hundred and eighty million, is substantially  cuz it just seems like, cuz the graduate schools there's not as much of a discrepancy with in-state and out-of-state tuition as there is, like, at among undergraduates right  yeah that general fund, money, where is the total general fund? here is the total general fund nine hundred and twenty-eight million right. and you know that about three hundred and, some comes from the state, four hundred and, substantial some comes from student tuition because you know when you add those together yo- you're almost there, mhm right right right why would like the business school, cost more than, L-S-and-A? like, is it   yeah   yeah (then) why is kinesiology paying so much? why is what? kinesiology. paying so much? well their tuition is like,    right   i know they're athle- athletic scholarships there but i don't honestly know, why (compute)   are they keeping tuition high in order to uh, reserve spots for, scholarship athletes who can afford it cuz they're getting scholarships? i don't know maybe figure this out for us. i d- i don't know. do an addendum for you.  right  that's what i kind of did my paper on. i did mine on, kines department and uh, i mean i figured it out, uh, i don't know if i did this right but i figured out per student but i did it, through uh instructional, mhm   and i said L-S-and-A is uh,     mhm oh yeah i just (wanna) um, raise the argument that i mean, i'm in-state so obviously well i'm biased and whatever but, i mean i think that out-of-state tuition is too expensive but i think what a lot of people forget too is, a lot of the programs a lot of the facilities that are here, that um, like people in-state won't be using. like a lot of like, the cultural programs and like the stuff like, they'll have, just like i don't know like groups, for people that are from out of state and different countries and stuff and that people from in-state are not going to really be using those things,  why?  not, yeah well i mean do you think that there are majors, that in-state students are not interested in? or uh, when you talk about programs. in some ways yeah that too but, i mean um, i don't really know if that's true. i i i don't really know you know if you, say looked at, um... you know if you if you want to focus on culture there are places you might look to focus on culture. so the b- well i guess what i'm asking is the budget doesn't even go towards those things though so it then my argument is totally whatever because, if those programs are not, the the funding isn't going for it then, it doesn't matter anyways. well you'd ha- you'd have to get into more budget detail. yeah   yeah i'm not saying classes even, i'm s- like it had nothing to do with  in in a way but i mean it's so it's so ridiculous like how much is, more out-of-state because, it's like i wonder how, they can justify it without breaking it down into detail,  well isn't it   right  so there's, i pay money too right exactly     well, it's (somewhat) off the subject now, oh  right  well  yes  i think it is a very interesting hypothesis now here here was an example of a paper that really laid out, uh a hypothesis. which was that, the curriculum, of a public school... would reflect to some degree, the population of the state. which do- does relate a little bit to the point you were making. and that to the extent that the populations differ, if you look at, if you were to choose, states that have very different, kinds of population, that you would expect to see, some reflection of that in, the courses or majors that were offered, and that that, in a sense is a response, to, the realities and desires of the state. it is a way in which the university does reflect. and i have no idea how that works. i was really surprised that i could show that,  Georgia. Georgia. so, Georgia had a much larger African American population than either of the other two, Washington had a much larger Asian American population, than, either of the other two. and, and yes, you did find, some differences that reflected those  (yeah) which, which is, i think very interesting and it's the kind of thing that is suggestive, but you'd really want them to look at a wider range of states, as as you suggested, and you'd wanna, kinda test this a little more finely. and there's other kind of casual evidence to suggest that this is the case, um if you look at New Mexico for example, uh i went to a meeting there recently and of course they have a much higher Native American population and there is, a lot of emphasis on Native American, uh, culture, and language there. and if you look at U-C-L-A, and you see how Latino Latino Latino studies are broken up into, sub groups, uh uh that are much more finely defined, out there that reflect, to some extent the nature of the Latino population, in the L-A area. there was a hand over there. yeah, uh was there um, like similar in Michigan, too?  this is a question you know there was a an issue_ we teach thirty-three languages i think in L-S-and-A. a lotta languages, thirty-two yeah so did i get it wrong? is it still, a major or not? (cuz)    suspended not completely (wiped.) now you uh it's easier to suspend than to eliminate first of all. yeah no that makes sense because like when i looked at the old bulletin i had um, the only, professor it had down there was Ralph Williams and i know that he's like, predominantly English so. right. but he, he was actually the director of the program for a number of years and of course anything Ralph teaches has huge enrollments. cuz Ralph was great  cuz he's     	1
SGR999SU146.json	oh, okay. yeah seven's good. okay alright.    yo- you wanna put our forms all together, (in this) i hope that music from the coffee shop doesn't, well they're pretty powerful microphones i suppose. w- should we go up and like testing     well i mean it's not exciting personal news it's just  tell us. okay well i f- well i first i talked to Frank Erikson and i got the uh extension. good   well i need to talk to um, C-K my boss my... i'm just laughing at you.  to see if she'll be around this summer and if she's not then, i don't know whether i can ask Frank is he gonna be around? well he said he's gonna be in Germany in May but    well i don't_ i mean he asks me he asked me again last week if he was my advisor for my I-C-P. oh dear mhm yeah mkay cuz like could y- could you email it to her or something? i was thinking about that. i'm_ the thing i'm most worried about is that i want a letter of recommendation from her and i feel like she's gonna be like, you know she didn't really turn in a very good paper for me last semester and now she's not even doing this one i only kn- i know she's only taking a couple classes like  i don't think so i think that like she might feel that you're going like out of your way to do this special project  yeah   um i, i thought that yeah like i thought that Mabelle my advisor was gonna she was gonna read my paper and write my  oh  mkay   uhuh mhm, (xx)   yeah        yeah yeah        are do you think that your um, like your research packet is gonna be like useful to these businesses too? like you might want to give them a copy of  yeah. um, i think that when they went around and did the interviews o- the one of the questions was like would you be interested in seeing our results? or something  oh yeah   so that's good. useful. yeah. so that's good that my project has a lot_ i mean it's just definitely being done now   yeah before you just had like these little forms and you were like circling things and, i know, i know or chewing gum. but you were s-    yeah you're      how much would you get paid?   oh, yeah ten dollars an hour is a nice um should i should put in like all  yeah  with h- oh it's so random. like today i just filled it in on the bus. li- from the last five weeks. yeah exactly like that's how it is with C-K and like it's hard not to just kinda like skimp a little cuz like,   yeah well i  yeah yeah   yeah and you got a little break like you weren't actually working you were just  yeah although th- that was definitely worse than working you know cuz i'm sitting in there going like oh my god i hate this place and, yeah i have um yeah i always use like, i translate how many  Emily        so they_ your people don't give you money for when you make copies? they don't well she_ if i said something to her_ she's just so scatter- she's just      right yeah also um like the lady at the Center for Chinese Studies is where i actually get paid from um she was like oh you should use our, copiers and she'll have like a code you know it's like all the money that you'll you know come but, like i'm not gonna take journal i can't even take out journals from the library  yeah  i have this uh funny st- i don't know if i told you this but_ well m- i don't know which if i told either of you this   i think it's true though because i                  yeah like even when you go and watch the librarians do it they'll like type in these random codes onto like classic    mhm   yeah yeah it's just so that they can keep their jobs. cuz  what would they do besides like get paper for the printers  perfect. perfect. your life is just coming together.   you want coat?  it's why is it_ why  oh i want some pop. look under cap,   okay okay is it okay      i_ no but i mean like do you mind if sh- did you mind? i don't care cuz   um, okay so i'm a little stressed out about it now because i only have like a couple weeks to work on it and i haven't contacted C-K like i should've like contacted her, like two or three weeks ago and been like hey i'm at a point_ cuz i'm not like i haven't really done work on it the last couple weeks, mhm so now you it's like you're going there and you h- don't have enough work to show for the amount of time is that what you mean? well i have the same amount of work i did about two weeks ago and it was just like if i had gone then it wouldn't have been so bad cuz you know i'd just done all this stuff. but now it's like an extra two weeks for me to   i mean what what has wh- does anything factor into, to it that they're first generation versus like second generation? or is that really not seem to be like    i think so, and i don't know whether it's more because she's more established here or whether cuz she has an economics degree from U-of  yeah mhm  taking notes? yeah, um so i guess what i had_ am planning on doing is you know coming up with a set of questions like i can't, i like i can- i feel a little_ like it's such a social anxiety thing to like go and like ask people to like talk to you or like take their picture  what if you had like a_ i don't know if this is helpful at all    yeah it doesn't really, alleviate any of the social anxiety  mhm mhm  mhm mhm yeah, well didn't Carol say some stuff about being able to hook you up with someone from Dinersty? or what did  yeah yeah yeah he worked there     yeah mhm. i can see why that would be nerve-racking. right. so i'm trying to finish up like i only have like a chapter left in, um this buis- this book and then like there's one chapter in this one that's about my topic and_ like i've read five books,  and they were_ they're all pretty u- they were all pretty useful? yeah they were pretty good um,  that's like a class.   maybe we should say Kelly enters no, i'm back from the bathroom.  is this is this uh, you made this list of questions? i made those a long time ago. oh okay oh okay  uhuh  i think i'd_ like ideally i'd wanna have, like, four to six businesses, mhm     they're all kind of you wanna do nonrestaurants? no i wanna do mostly  Asian bakeries yeah i think that's good because even if you can- even if some of the information's like, restauranteering specific at least i mean, you've, g- gained some insight into that specific thing. mhm   you_ yeah it would be like a confounding factor if you had other businesses probably  i think this paper sounds really interesting.  i just feel like i'm i mean, i is it the time that's,  twenty-one sounds like, the incomplete would be really, good for you.  yeah and i i um emailed Frank and i asked him if you had to be enrolled in at the same time if you're gonna take an incomplete. and he says you don't have to be enrolled so,   yeah  yeah i'm sure they um a lot of people end up doing that      well he was funny about it cuz    yeah    yeah yeah yeah just thirty pages, pssh  oh okay well i wanted to talk about today actually. mkay      well you made i- made the decision to s- maybe you weren't gonna have C-K as your advisor anymore. hey hello   don't be alarmed. this is oh, this is Jeremy this is Kelly   hi Jeremy. hi (i'm) Jeremy what are      we just like to listen to       oh that's exciting. hope you guys have good  yeah yup, (don't use that.) yup, thanks for that bit of advice. well you've read f- five books. i  yeah i think you're okay. i have yeah i- it was al- it was you know pretty humiliating to talk to   um well i don't you know it's hard to tell but, she's pretty like, straight like, like a wall yeah    mhm        like that's a substantial amount of people. yeah mhm they should do it like they do in the L-S-A. yeah kinda guide you through it. and then the I-C people people can do it with you guy_ you know?    have to have results.   mhm but he doesn't even know that he's your other  he even wrote it down in my file and he's like yeah i just wanna make sure this was, true or whatever. i'm like you ask me every time you even wrote it down. yeah maybe  i was concerned about that. are you did you talk to Warren    yeah i know he should have,   yeah   well you might be able to do like an independent one this summer. oh yeah you could do independent one. see i don't wanna take any credits, you know cuz i have four-oh-two to take, and the G-R-E to study for and work and research     i don't even know if she's gonna be around. i wouldn't want to do that i don't think. if i was, gonna do it i would, i would make him, let me do only a two credit one and i would take like the English writing, creative writing or  ew i would wanna take something that doesn't involve writing papers. but i have so many extra credits   maybe um also maybe if you you know you, if you can't get out of it like maybe you can make your writing your paper the thing cuz it's like a a you're writing something you know.    you could find old papers you have i could take this tape recording. this is a spoken word. it's kind of the hip hop dance thing that's funny. um so can i continue? or     yeah m- Mabelle kinda made me feel dumb. but i think it's just because she like is working with other people in the Linguistics Department that are doing their thes- their theses, or    that's a really  you're  that's a really good idea.         yeah she doesn't if she gets panicky maybe she'll do it for you. i know, i kn- if she realizes i can't take care of myself. it is it's embarrassing. that sounds like a really great     yeah yeah he will. i like practical. so i have to get this other book  who knows, what you could be like the, bilingual consulting firm.  for Frank? and you have to do it before the kids get out let out of school and no one's at the school anymore. yeah  yeah by your birthday it's done. yeah, done two months to your birthday. you can do it. so i can tell you i can talk about what i did with the kids yesterday. okay  six-thirty. oh we we're doing  yeah we're doing good. um,  well it's a different girl now it's a different person  oh,   she's real- she would_ she'd be down for it. i bet they laugh a lot.  oh oh that sucks. yeah and he like, i don't know it just caused a problem. so it's just a regular public school in Detroit right? yeah where is it in Detroit? it's um, you know Fort,    it's a it's on a street i- do you know like Lafayette and Florida are parallel to each other  okay yeah that's i think that's exactly my area i think i   hmm that's interesting.   small world it is. i drove around the area w- it's neat cuz it's like Mexican st- like everything_ oh, Spanish Hispanic stuff all over the place. let's see. okay so here's Fort... oh no it's right outside of my area. cuz my, Fort is there and that's Lafayette and my area is like all of this in here. oh okay wh-  where's Waterman? i think Waterman's in my a- area but it, not  i'm Fort_ between Fort and, where's Laf- where'd Lafayette go? here, here is, Lafayette. and Waterman yeah and your area's on the other side of  uhuh  how how is that considered southwestern Detroit is there is it southwestern?      i get it. yep. so should we do a plan of what we want to get done for this next week? i think i need to  um i don't have anything more to say. kay i think i have our itinerary, here. let's see if we got our stuff accomplished from six months ago. oh God where is it? got a expandable file. yeah you like that? you girls and your expandable, files. i don't_ does anyone have a new piece of paper? i don't think th- so who's coming to sewing circle tonight?  oh yeah i am doing the study on the sewing circle Erica. oh  really? yeah but i don't have it  yeah they like ask all these specific questions on the um, that I-R-B form i had to fill out, and they're like what are you gonna do with the data when you are done with it? and i was like well it'll probably go into a folder and it'll probably eventually make it to my parents' basement and then maybe it'll be thrown away when my mom decide_ okay so Kelly's goals were... you taught th- your kid but you were gonna make the rest of the flashcards and you were gonna email Mabelle an email for more words. right, didn't do that. whatever. i did that. and i was_ i don't know what i was gonna do. circle more, it's done do m- put more circles on forms. what did i do that was (circling) you just got all these forms out and you were just doo doo doo doo doo, circle something yeah that was serious business. i'm gonna get my thesis published and when you g- what what were you doing though with those forms if you had no point to your thesis paper? i  i think you're talking about the interview   yeah i was trying to figure out what i should do for my thesis. cuz this is the information i have you know. oh okay but i don't remember circling things.  oh well you know i wrote so- s- down here some, you went like this possible questions. so are you excited about that Cosi opening up? oh oh    well why does Juzi- Julie like it if it's so bad. it's a chai- it's a big chain it's just like Starbucks. it looks exactly like that same kind of like plush  oh uhuh hmm  well may- i'm sure that's what they're intending to do for it here i mean basically it's set up a lot like Starbucks but not as study-oriented. will they serve alcohol at night? at    it was, th- one of the worst three days of my life  i was like i'm gonna write down a list of people to remind myself that i don't enjoy hanging out with them and like why, because i forget. did you get to meet all his like relatives and friends and  mhm     oh  oh what's wrong with him? i mean he's just so obnoxious such a jerk.  it's really nice. yeah that's a woman's hat isn't it? i think so. it's  it could be but yeah it's  i didn't see your name on there. i told you last Tuesday. i know. why is      i know but i like i'm writing  i'm sorry you'll have a great time together. yeah i remember you did tell me and i was like if we all we're all gonna bond and not care about you. yeah you me and Katy? we're gonna solidify our relationships for after school. yeah    we've got business c-       yeah i was in Danny's group. yeah i don't, that's weird i didn't know that.      yeah and i feel like they really didn't intend for them to have any purpose after being up so they weren't really like super   mhm what are we gonna do at the dinner? just eat,   well put me down on the map.    mm that'll  uhuh uhuh  what a- what are you ta- i have no idea what you're  you didn't tell me about those you said they were for the the arts. yeah, they're called the Robbie awards  so Katy's getting one?  why is she getting one?  maybe she's not. i don't remember if her name was on there or not. well did you put her at our  must've been Darcy. i don't know why she's getting one. i would imagine all those teachers turn around and hate her. well i know that what's her name does. who? like what's her name? um, she's the one she had for like Greek. oh Cindy  well she'd be getting it from well she's g- she's getting it from her advisor who  yeah he loves her?        yeah i'm surprised that she's the favorite. i don't know if it's true i i thought i heard it from you but  i think, i think people when they initially meet Katy really like her    yeah that's true she's a weird candidate for something like      she was stressing about what format to put it in and like well like i mean sh- yeah i would s- i would be like okay this is your senior project like yeah was she supposed to do that just pumulate accumulate poems that she had already     yeah i di- i thought she was more of just a fiction writer or, creative writing. yeah oh i always thought she was just poetry. well what was that book she's been writing for a while,   what happened to that book is she still writing it? she finish it? i don't  um,  i yeah i haven't read many things of hers that i like but maybe that's tainted b- i,     well i thought also that it was like um, like she made all these like she has a good vocabulary and like lots of these random words put together but they didn't really always form like an image to me or something like that i'm like i'm like oh you have a good vocabulary but like what are you saying?     i feel like her poetry really exemplifies the way she is where she_ i- or in terms of like like like where she really wants to impress you and         no you know she wasn't she would like to let us know that. i wanted to ask you if you'd be willing to go in on a scheme with me  why won't she she keeps putting it back up there, she puts my stuff  let's let's can we can is it cuz she bathes every night and puts it up there? or is she i think it's cuz she's clumsy and she doesn't like the idea of like knocking over stuff. cuz when i lived at Walnut Street, it was a similar situation where but she would never actually move it cuz she was you know too scared of us or whatever you know she wasn't as like, forward about things but she'd be like oh guys i have an idea for the bathroom to make it neater like why don't we all get our own little, like caddies and put our stuff in it and then she like did it for her as an example and none of us did it and then like well she's tolerated it for the whole year and then when she cleaned the bathroom  well i'm i'm sure it irritated her when she cleaned the bathroom.   okay  i mean when sh- no i don't care.   and i think maybe we should put her stuff there  yeah   oh okay  i have like three things on the,  okay okay i think those, um caddies are kind of not very hygienic because you don't_ like they get all grimy in the bottom  i mean i, would   i thought it was because_ cuz sometimes when she takes a bath she takes     yeah it has happened since she,  yeah, what a great housemate she is. i'm sure she um, is telling Bill and saying like i'm the only who even cleans around the house. (xx) that yeah that freaks me out  it's so bizarre. it's so, bizarre. she l- she interprets things so, yeah um, and i know you're gonna yell at me but i read her mood gauge or whatever    i bet she's so rude to everybody   she's on and off with it.      mhm mkay yeah. kay what are your goals? by Tuesday right  did you finish your other book? no, no way. you need to learn how to um, speed read. (xx) nope i haven't ever been able to do it my whole life. is that good? yeah. um my goal is to get in contact with C-K and hopefully meet with her, and to finish my reading cuz there's not much left. i'm gonna circle more stuff on the interview, no. have you_ you've been reading books? um right i gotta see him. i can't tell  oh he i'm sure he's, an artist?   he's this jerk from my class that's a real asshole.   yeah i'm sure it's like slam or uh   he's incredible. drawing. so i'm gonna finish the reading i'm gonna read the rough draft that she gave me, and i'm going to um, create or i'm gonna try_ i_ see i'm gonna have a lot of trouble like from the rough draft deciding what i think like i should produce or whatever, but i'm gonna try to conceptualize what i should produce and then, email it to her so that she can like, critique it or whatever  so um, do we get_ don't we get free pizza or   coupons  mhm money     maybe we should get it after this if she gives a coupon. you just want her to give us like twenty dollars. i don't want a p- i don't really want pizza though. oh  it'd be fun  (yeah it's kinda) so cuz i- and email Dewer. um i hope they think we're funnyish. i think  yeah we're, we're really s- and we were i think we were pretty tame,    so we had a really good speaker today in our class. for what class. for Frank's class,  who was it? Liz Anderson. who_ weren't you talking about, her     um equality it's what all the article's about like, she was talking about like her idea of what equality should mean versus like a what a lot of people we've read have said,     wha- Nick_ yeah and this guy well Nick Feuer from a radio station, he um, your boyfriend oh yeah yeah he like he came to class like i swear       proposal  that's what Peter does too.   i know. he um,  he's not very smart. he doesn't_ yeah he didn't lis-  wait a minute he works for E-S-I. um we like him he has things on tape. i know. let's make a list of the three ugliest boys we knew. i wonder if, we saw that li- if it would be funny to look at that list now. we threw it out though didn't we cuz it was i'm sure we did   yeah your my my   see i feel like i mean i like i actually like the class a lot   mhm  yeah hmm there was such yeah s- intimidating just to be talking about like  yeah, cuz they're not     i have such difficulty in any of my classes taking away like, a a fundamental idea or like, oh yeah well doesn't it upset hmm i think that college like, i mean it's hard to remember all the things that you learned or whatever um i think it's more of a like a confidence booster, like you have a college degree. mhm   i doubt that. see like i mean, like maybe i don't know um i mean i think that you know a lot more about ac- like Detroit than i do and like things going on there and like,   well like the class with Frank Erikson the inequality class the class i'm taking now of the, um political economy of black America that's totally supposed to be like that like,   maybe in the years that you are not learning like when you're not going to school anymore you'll start thinking        yeah, i feel like you should read the Liz Anderson article.  mhm   i always agree with everything but i feel like that it's not like, you know like this as opposed to some other author like they're opposites like it's just like they're adding on to bigger and  well with Frank's class i mean he would have us_ we'd stop and then we would have to like critique it in like a five- to ten-page paper, and i was like i can't critique it. i think it's all right.    i mean i feel like um, but like the opposite if you do have too strong of an opinion one way then you'll always be able to critique other ones you know like it's kinda like you have to, k- like find a balance. yeah  yeah like i told him i wanted him to read some of our stuff from the class cuz i was like i think it'll like, maybe like change your mind a little bit about Marxism but,  well Cohen did but like his was just mostly like i grew up in this like you know militant like communist upbringing and like  i think that all of these a- authors are in agreement that Marxism is, implausible. yeah, see i don't i don't know like i didn't think the Cohen one was like very much at all, cuz he didn't even talked about like, Hegel and dialectic and stuff, but i saw the girl but i think she left. it's seven. see that wasn't hard at all. no nope, we're good chit-chatters. we'll do it for two more hours. we have to do it for  she's looking over here but, she saw me look at her. oh well. wait we a-  i mean when we do sewing circle. oh   no like the mall, the mall's open till nine. oh,  so you're gonna go to the mall now? i, well no well when is  what_ that's next Thursday? yeah. 	1
LES175SU025.json	or i believe i'm (uh) participating in the experiment, you may also find yourself in in collateral damage so to speak, so i'd like to introduce Bret and Janine, who just want to, fill you in and tell you about the form you've been handed out. Bret and or Janine. well while you're filling those in you should know that uh, picking, myself as an example has doomed this to failure because, we uh had to buy a motor from Cedarville Marine up in the eastern upper peninsula this year, and uh i talked to Julie there who's in charge of sales and so on, and she was you know we everything went through and then Michelle and the rest of the crew who've been working up there went through and she said oh, um, your Mr Smith talks funny. and Michelle says yes yes yes yes she's she he he's from England she says well you'd think if he was from England he could speak English without an accent. so if any of you have any questions, um, you can talk to one of us, either after the class or  i'll give you a couple of minutes because uh i, like you to listen to me as well so_ have you started taping? oh what do you know. drink coffee drink coffee... stay in bed stay in bed getting out of here get out of here dress warmer dress warmer. what about on a hot day what do you do on a hot day? (get) naked i'm sorry i missed that one uh take your clothes off i don't know, less  take a shower cold shower is that before or after getting naked? in terms of what? what do you when you_ w- on these sheets, which are describing the habitat, what do you write in there? temperature  temperature weather, all sorts of things. what do you write about the behavior of the fish? where they are yeah but not so much in other words, wh- when you're feeling uncomfortable and it's hot, it's the first thing you think is, oh, it's ninety degrees, time to get naked. or, it's uh, you know fifty degrees, oh, time to time to stay in bed, so that your decisions are based on a measured thermometer temperature? no. so we have an interesting dichotomy here, in that as part of science, we measure, the heck out of everything in order to describe the habitat. yet, we know from ourselves, that, organisms don't respond to those things we measure, but rather some, effect of what they measure on the physical condition, and the comfort in the examples eight i gave you those kinds of things. now, we measure, a whole variety of variables, really only for one reason, as a standard for communication with other people. so that if i tell you that the temperature is forty degrees, you because of your superior knowledge of fishes, that's gonna tell you something about, the kinds of fish you might find and those sorts of things, so it's a standard for comparison, but it's not the way that an animal sees and responds to the environment, itself nor the way we ourselves see, and respond, to the environment. so we have a dichotomy in terms of, the way we measure the environment, a product of human technology, versus the way we actually respond to the environment. and um, if you think of human technology and all the devices you can use to describe the technology, there are potentially millions. we've rarely focused on things such as temperature but we could've taken, disso- dissolved oxygen meters out except i can tell you from experience most of the water around here is pretty saturated that we look at, um, we could've measured P-C-Bs and goodness knows what other various poisons that are kicking around, we might have measured we could've measured a host of things to physically describe the environment, but we haven't. you should be grateful. um... there's a technological view though, but the other view is to try and think of the environment the way the animal sees it, and to try and think about, an animal's eye view of the environment, and this is what Fred Fry tried to advocate. he said, how do animals respond to the environment. not what can we measure about the environment, but how do animals respond to the environment. and this led to, the what uh fish biologists call,    twenty-five? say twenty-five so the ultimate lethal la- lethal level for something we can measure, for a trout might be twenty-five C. um, what sort of temperatures might be important if uh the thing's just sort of not feeling too great, maybe down here at twenty-four twenty-two say, they can remain at twenty-two though that's pushing it a bit, well trout can still move into this zone, because in this zone they will resist death, and therefore export a zone of, resistance, they can resist death for a while even though if they stay there they could die. this is quite important because say in a lake such as Douglas Lake that stratifies and you have a thermocline, we have warm water above and cool water below. now the water above might be well what's the temperature at the surface of Dougla- Douglas Lake just at the moment? twenty-four twenty-four? oh darn there goes that example. what was the temperature at Kleiber dam? was it twenty-seven? something like that? okay, um, but in the bottom of Kleiber dam, the temperature was probably pretty low, probably down maybe as low as fifteen sixteen, so there's nothing to stop a trout, coming up into this twenty-seven degree water, for just long enough to snatch off some im- poor innocent, unsuspecting minnow. so, fish in lakes such as these, such as the cold water fish, may come inshore, to the, warm water, potentially lethal water, say to feed. those, perch we caught in the gill net, i'm sorry to remind you of that, they had come from the cooler waters, moving onshore, to feed. now Clay and John are picking up some of these mosh- movements of the fishes in the- in their project to see just how much they are, and the larger fish typically are down in the cooler waters and they move in upshore and, you are finding probably not today in view of the weather, but certainly on the first run you found the inshore offshore movements of some of those fish. and what they're doing is, in spite of the fact that the surface temperatures if they stayed there, would be lethal, they can still go in there for a while, to exploit the resources and then run off, run back home to the, the cool water. so, in this uh, lethal, in terms of lethal factors, there is an ultimate lethal level, for anything we can measure, that will eventually have a, well biological response, a sort of behavioral response, in that the animals will die, okay? but, it always takes time to die, and fish can exploit the resistance zone, between the completely sublethal level of a factor, and the ultimately lethal level, they can go in there for a while come out and so on. so in the boat-well, while we're getting the engine going in spite of the fact that the smoke becomes blue with fumes and bad language, we can still tolerate that carbon monoxide, for a short period of time, if, we're stupid enough to but we can still tolerate it for a while right? how many of you have seen The Full Monty? not many of you have seen The Full Monty yeah, you know that guy was able to be pulled out of the car where he was trying to commit suicide, um because it does take a while and thereby it saved his life. um and if you haven't seen The Full Monty have you seen The Full Monty you should see The Full Monty, um, in your spare time. okay, so these are lethal factors. one thing to mention about lethal factors, is that they, uh it's a very common method, used in monitoring the environment. and it's used in, bioassays. there are many forms of bioassays, but a very common form, is this lethal bioassay, where they will spo- expose organisms such as fish, to a wide range of say, temperatures P-C-B levels and so on, and construct a curve to try and find the relationship between, dose, and death, um, drug companies do this kind of thing although they are trying to find the relationship between dea- uh dose and life of course those kinds of things, but the bioassay is a very standard method for pollution control and these kinds of things. it's a very easy technique to use because, it's very easy to tell when a fish is belly up and therefore dead. but, i hope you realize, that as a technique for monitoring the environment, it's really temperature?     X axis is wha-  so Fry made that prediction before the (xx) Fry did indeed. and uh some guy wanted to pad his publication record you've all heard of padding publication records, spent years doing this experiment and publishing one fish's preferred temperature and then another and then another and then another, until he was the laughing stock. he had a huge long publication thing, absolute laughing stock, a warning for those who believe in um, the least publishable unit. okay, these are, controlling factors. they control the rate of metabolism, by the fundamental effect on the state of activation of matter, and the way in which biochemical reactions take place. it doesn't matter, what you necessarily measure, this is a common, biological response, for a suite of factors that technology can measure and we can call, temperature and pressure. but the principle in terms of animal responses, occurs in a- i- in terms of biochemical reactions, the fundamental, biochemical reactions that underlie metabolism. now it's all very well, having a metabolic capability, that is set by, these, controlling factors. but you can only realize that potential, if there is nothing in the way. you can only realize that potential if there is nothing in the way. for example you have tremendous potential up here, to learn all sorts of things. however, if you have to eat in the cafeteria for eight solid weeks, then you're likely to go crazy and you won't realize the full potential, right? you have to get out of camp occasionally, um, that's a, a somewhat arcane limiting factor but but it illustrates the point. other, in terms of the um re- responses to the environment, any factor in the environment, that prevents an organism from realizing its metabolic, capability, that is defined as, a limiting, factor. now, continuing with our metabolic framework, let's think of say metabolism C-six-H-twelve-O-six equals six C-O-two plus six H-two-O plus energy, okay this is what we're doing this is the overall equation for the metabolism of carbohydrates with oxygen, oh we've missed out the oxygen. the overall, metabolism of carbohy- by by burning it with oxygen. what happens if there's not enough oxygen? they're not gonna have enough energy gonna slow the rate of metabolism isn't it? in other words, the uh things like temperature and pressure, controlling factors will determine, the potential rate for this reaction. but, if oxygen is limiting, you won't realize the potential. if carbon d- if uh carbon dioxide, is not removed, then you know from the laws of mass action that you'll slow this reaction, and the potential won't be realized. if we were looking at the metabolism of an amino acid, if, the nitrogen, was not being removed fast enough, then that would limit the reaction. limiting factors then typically, interfere with, the supply of metabolites, and or, the removal of waste products. so factors that limit metabolism, that prevent the metabolism from realizing the potential, set by the controlling factors, those factors preventing that potential being realized, are considered, limiting factors. they limit the potential from being realized and they are typically the metabolites the substrates or the products of metabolism, that have to be supplied at adequate rates, or have to be removed at adequate rates. Jenny did you have a question? yeah i just_ you said that the supply of metabolites and okay i repeated it. okay. um, i think this is pretty obvious and it doesn't matter what we measure. okay? anything, that interrupts metabolism in this way has the same metabolic consequence for the organism, and that is, it limits the metabolism. it doesn't matter whether it's high levels of say zinc in the environment which damages the gills, it doesn't matter if it's low oxygen, it doesn't matter if it's high carbon dioxide, it doesn't matter if it's an accumulation of waste products, it just simply doesn't matter, the metabolic response of the animal is identical, in all of those situations, and if you know that something is a limiting factor, you know what it's going to do. and if you measure something new or you could, you know what suites of chemicals do, you know what the animal response is you don't have to study every single individual, jot and tittle and so on in the environment, because, you can often deduce the category of responses it's likely to be and therefore, know what the animal is going to do. or, let us think what happens with a a limiting factor because, we get s- some interesting kinds of results here. let's look at metabolism again, and we'll look at uh we'll look at uh the controlling factor as a function of temperature, and here's the active metabolic rate and here's the standard metabolic rate. a limiting factor, something that interrupts metabolism, is likely to have its greatest effect, when the energy demand is highest. for example, if you're just going for a walk, in the middle of Ann Arbor where the carbon monoxide levels are substantially higher than up here, you know that's fine. but if on, you know Saturday night when the traffic's crawling down Main Street, and you're sitting having your coffee oh no so you're saying that, the need to use a regulatory system, increases your standard metabolism? um, typically a change in the environment from the preferred environment, can be thought of as an addition to standard metabolism. it increases the energy required just to keep body and soul together. a_ for you, in winter, with inadequate s- s- central heating, you will, make up for the inadequate central heating, as so often happens in campus housing i understand, uh will be maki- make up for that, by increasing your metabolism, if it really gets cold you'll start shivering, but you'll still crank up your metabolism a little. on the other hand in um uh, in in the summer, when you'll be sweating like a pig all the energy will be required for that, um, if you don't have air conditioning. and these can be seen as an increase in the minimum energy the standard metabolic rate, in order to keep body and soul together. um, stresses of all sorts will do the same thing. all the chemical stresses uh uh and so on, that are in the environment will tend to do the same, kinds of things. the, response of the organism to this category is always the same. the consequences are entirely predictable, in terms of energy supply, and therefore in terms of the range of habitats where the animal may be able to live, and indeed in terms of the, preferred habitats for the animal the bottom the bottom? in the plume or the open lake. the bottom's so close to the surface in Lake Erie. okay well you haven't experienced this then but fishermen say you catch the biggest fish, by thermal plumes power plants are good for us, they provide big fish, um, this is a case where, um a lot of the predators, will accumulate near these productive areas, to feed, um and they have been attracted, they've been redirected in space by in this case the thermal environment, in such a way that they can increase their energy uh, consumption. so these are factors that direct animals in space. they can also, you can also, see, um that animals are directed in time... February this year. it was still grey in Ann Arbor wasn't it. how did you feel in April when the sun came out...? good? great? terrific? you know they say when spring comes a young man's fancy turns now why is that? things are happening in time. um, the environment is variable, but there are certain clues in the environment. things like photoperiod, temperature period, are major factors. they corollate with major events in the environment and many of them, happen to do with good times to reproduce and those kinds of things, and tend to be associated with sex, but there's also getting ready for winter. when winter comes, fish, um go and hide those kinds of places. so, factors in the environment can also influence the way fishes respond in time, particularly seasonally, for reproduction, for parental care, for migration, and those kinds of things. these again involve energy expenditures. um, i'm told that uh, sex requires a lot of energy perhaps you could advise me sometime, there was good coffee 	1
ADV700JU047.json	alright Sue now it's like uh i dropped like Chem one-twenty-five. this year? this   mhm ri- oh but you dropped chem    okay mhm right. i mhm  you can do a double major or did you know that you can concentrate in mathematical economics? what do you mean by that? no i mean,   is it like a very i mean substantial degree i mean organization- i mean i think, mhm    yes. how many? well as an L-S-and-A student even if you don't major in L-S_ in in organizational studies you may take up to twelve credits,   uhuh   mhm  um, it depends on what you want your double major to be  so you know you want_ if you wanted to econ- economics, and organizational studies you could certainly do that and organizational studies? i could do both?   i have thirty-one plus like uh i think since i'm dropping this uh eleven (i have) forty-two, right now. okay so you are going to need, seventy-eight more credits to go. to get an organizational studies and economics? no to get an L-S-and-A degree   you wouldn't be a double-degree cuz both of those majors are in L-S-and-A, okay  right a hundred and twenty, same amount  alright and organizational studies is pretty much um quite diverse subjects right? i mean yes it's very interdisciplinary um one thing that you should be aware of with organizational studies is that, you can't double-count courses, so for example if you're majoring in economics and organizational studies you could not double-count your economics credits,  well you'd have to take a different class.  i know yeah mhm seventy,    yeah um i don't have the flyer here you can get the flyer right outside of our office, uhuh how many credits are thirty credits thirty credits? you have to_ and t- four of the thirty credits needs to be statistics, mhm (also) but you just told me that you can't double-count them right but you_ right well she_ i think you just_ you can just_ you have the stats but then you have take like four credits of a different class  what other kind of courses are required for   no it depends on how you wanna organize it. okay   is it a three-hundred-level course or a  um if it w- it's probably one-sixty? i i think so one-sixty. it would be_ count as a prerequisite it would make you_ for all of your concentrations for economics uhuh   nope  okay mhm  that is how that works   yeah it does  mhm for what for statistics? for statistics if i wanna well let's look at the prereqs for statistics not very many people major in statistics i don't know those by heart.  yeah it's interesting that that would be the case. let me just, economics you you need Math one-fifteen which i know you have uhuh yeah  no mhm oh the old one?      thirty credits   one course is similar between the both right? econ and right well you can use the eco- the Statistics four-twenty-five and four-twenty-six here statistics you could take Statistics four-twenty-six, ka-chew which is... mhm that also overlaps? mhm thirty no well that's just_ it's a it's a pretty basic class. but you would need to take mathematics through Linear Algebra, so are you in Calc Three now or    so that's_ you're in good shape for that if you like that. so you need to take two more semesters of mathematics, and then you'd just basically need to make sure you'd_ then then you're ready to take thirty credits of stats. and they tell you the courses, you need to have both four-twenty-five and four-twenty-six which is Probability, four-oh-two, which is just Intro to Statistics and four-thirteen which i have no idea what it is General Linear Models you're thinking about models and applications there, and then you get to sort of specialize i don't know_ i i know one thing i have to do major in economics but i,  right. and i     in organizational studies? yeah if it's about business history, yes. business history? so that's_ organizational studies is sort of, linked around the theme of social organizations. so all the courses have names such as Law and Social Organization. and besides um, this and my twenty-four credits i can still take like up to twel- how many credits do i have?  you_ yeah i think you have nine credits of_ oh yeah eight credits  or i could take more also if i want right?   you got it. and you know if if you're in a situation where you're taking so many courses outside of  L-S-and-A for example if you, said i don't care if i don't get into engineering i'm going to continue to take mechanical engineering courses, uhuh     correct   mhm it can you_ we have credit equivalency books you can look it up, if N-Y-U offers an analogous course you can take some economics courses outside of U-of-M, sure. no i mean courses that are specific for the concentration  if if you can find a course which comes in uhuh uhuh,  right and you also can't_ and you have to be careful like most departments will say you can take up to so many credits outside of our department, a- la- li- let's see if econ says that.  must be taken on Ann Arbor campus other than that i mean is anything else i   okay  right one course two course not a biggie. you know six courses yes a biggie. and what about for organizational studies then? well same difference. you know again you can't take most of the concentration outside of U-of-M but you  well it depends on your interests, um one of my students is majoring in economics and philosophy, you know if you like, philosophy that would work well, economics and political science economics and history, economics and American culture economics and English, economics and comparative literature is my most ambitious student he's got two languages and economics, mhm maybe i will try like next semester i could start off taking four-oh-one, mhm  yeah no i'll_ maybe i'll take Psych one-eleven? so maybe Psych four-oh- you know Econ four-oh-one, and Intro Psych, um if you're thinking of org studies you know, uh maybe two of the prerequisite kinds of classes to think about that, um are you thinking seriously about statistics? i don't know   prerequisite kind of Psych one-eleven four-oh-one what else? do you need any humanities? i'm not sure how many i have in humanities. how many_ have you had any philosophy religion? i've had like um no... i've had like uh first-year humanities seminar okay i mean that's a possibility to take another humanities if you're thinking about maybe majoring in statistics, you might wanna go on and take Calc Three. i don't know film and video studies also count as the humanities or social  film and video studies? humanities. i've got one more of that.  i mean just doing economics give me so much like freedom to do whatever i want for  i could finish my concentration like by end of next year i think? by_ if i   i was thinking about, i wanted to do accounting also   hm, accounting is again_ both four-oh-one and Accounting two-seventy-one take up a lot of time, but if those are areas of interest, people do it,  so um, yeah i_ so that_ i mean that would be a possibility and that would count as one of your, that would count as another non-L-S-and-A class. if that's something that you want... i want i wanted to show you math just_ oh it's open to math just so you know math i couldn't just like, i went through the concentration and it seemed like uh you wouldn't want to major in something like   well you have to t- you'd have to take_ it's the same prerequisites that you would need for statistics. two-one-five two-one-six yep you need two more classes... do you  um, a  um i'm not sure.  i guess i could go   ri- well i think that's true of almost anything you know it's good to learn,   yep mhm okay well you actually don't need to do it anymore, even even if you major in economics you don't need to do anymore so the question is, do you like it? would it make you happy to go on? they're happy if you go on i'm happy if you go on are you happy if you go on? what if i, take a history course? how how tough are history courses? two-hundred-level history courses? well history courses, are gonna be, a different kind of skill right? so if you're gonna do statistics like if you're gonna take Statistics four-twenty-six and Economics four-oh-one and Accounting two-seventy-five you're gonna have tons and tons and tons of problem sets,  uhuh   uhuh yep nope and that's the nice thing with the bu- you know you can always look it up, you know so and history doesn't tend to have a lot of prerequisite courses. y- you can pretty much you know there's some mhm i think (it's here)  well it's like anything else if you it's gonna be like political science. reading and writing right reading and writing. it's not gonna be like um, the prebusiness courses or the or the pre-engineering courses cuz they're not trying to weed anybody out. i mean,  oh yeah.  yes.      in natural science? mhm yes anything else? chemistry and um i guess that's it. then the answer is no. how many credits do i need? you need seven credits of natural science so you'd need four more credits. ehhh- Engineering one-oh-one? it's it's not an L-S-and-A class Computer Science one-eighty-three? mathematics and symbolic analysis, um (taken) something in natural science i i think you might need to take another natural science. i keep that up for, some time later maybe. yeah. pretty sure i've done one more course did you take physics? no.  nope nope i hate biology  astronomy i was interested in maybe i'll take that some time you could even take that,  don't you think that will be too much of course load four-oh-one Psych one-eleven, uh astronomy and uh history? it's like a little bit, very spread out i mean, um i think it's it's good to have something a little different it's up to you, i mean only if it feels comfortable to you, but again it's a different way of, of looking you could get an astronomy lab, it would be your only lab course you can go look at the stars it could be,  (it's) probably more like astrophysics and not just looking   you know just something i think that you should just for your fourth course it should just be something that you think is interesting, either something  why don't you take another film and video course then?  you could even do a dual concentration with economics and film and video studies yeah, but it's like, i i don't know if it will like be a good major film and video double major? and uh hmm what do you mean by a good major? good major is, Sue like get me a_ i don't know go back home it's like mhm  mhm right mhm well, i mean economics is a pretty broad-based        mhm y- they wanna look at_ they want (us) look at the kind of college you're coming from  very strongly. would you say in the like top five or top ten? top ten. top ten? mhm... this is U-of-M.  um very strong economics department very you know renowned faculty um you also want to_ i mean there's_ y- you wanna be a good student you wanna major in something that you're good at so if you're coming from a good school and having good grades, in that major what have you gotten in one-oh-one and one-oh-two? Cs so economics might not be, no i mean, i know why i got Cs i mean i, kind of like took all the homeworks and you know and  okay.    yes i've i've read i've actually read a little bit but i'm i also_ so i don't think necessarily that if you were to, either you know do a dual concentration in economics and film and video studies or just happen to take lots of film and video studies cuz it made you happy and when you talk about it you kind of light up alright that's true. it's a matter of your personal intellectual strengths and interests... alright thanks a  i_ see two courses i'm pretty sure i'm taking next semester Psych one-eleven and Econ  maybe i might take film and video and two-one-five? yep. that's fine or film and video and two-seven- and two-seventy-one Accounting. whatever makes you... alright thanks a lot Sue you happy so you wanna take your little org studies sheet yep alright   oh okay i don't mean to steal the students' bulletins  okay thanks a lot Sue  alright thanks a lot Sue yeah.  hi um did she hit you out there? yeah i  i'm sure she'll, track him down as well. let me just (straighten out my) (xx) here okay well i brought my transcript, good (xx) i have no computer i've got  mhm mkay okay  yay are you trying to graduate early? no   not trying to graduate   yeah i'm just doing biochem. okay... so this this is still good then so you basically have, seven credits of natural science seven credits of social science, four credits of humanities and you needed three more credits of humanities as of April of last year, which would be oh it's going this way it's it's fine i think i got two this summer. Spanish you got philosophy... so one more little class for you there, okay  mhm   it's fine just don't mind me i'm just gonna write Physics one-forty one-forty-one... and you're currently in two-forty- two-forty-one that's beautiful okay alright there now i'm happy okay but yeah chemistry's in the same department_ biochemistry is in the chem department so that wouldn't have fallen under (xx) that was bad advice okay and comp race and ethnicity R-and-E everything was done and you need a junior-senior writing which i assume you can just, take in chemistry or biochem- or you could take   okay well this is how it works and this is where it's really frustrating and i don't have a computer i don't have anything um up-to-date this is like the last printed course guide that existed  oh okay. okay okay  don't have to do it in physics and so if for example   you know and there's tons of courses in the humanities that fulfill junior-senior. so you could just click on junior-senior,   no that's   okay next May. you've two full years. two_ three terms  um, next semester i wanted to see if there's any way_ um i'm taking the M-CATs in the spring. and so i decided only to take twelve credits since i don't need credits. mhm  it's it's okay, mhm i don't have  yeah i have i have that  okay i,   mhm yes  okay mhm   and they have  yeah i was gonna do that but, does that count for anything? it does not count for distribution Spanish is_ this is how it works and they're gonna make you take all these, speaking classes until you can get to the lit  okay i think i'd rather speak anyway.    right. so would that be a total waste to take, two-seventy?    okay i mean i just i want to to keep up my sch- so i know it will be a personal, achievement mhm well you need a hundred and twenty, credits to graduate anyway and since you're planning on staying the full amount of time even though you already have senior status at the beginning of your junior year, uhuh okay  okay  yeah okay okay, um and then, i had one more question so so all that i need for_ because i have my race and ethnicity and i have my, um language now    i did that twice but i'm planning on doing it oops so you do need that i'm planning on doing that again though this winter so that would, so i need one, but if i do if i do band again then that would be, that will do it mhm so that works out really well. okay yep did you have the... so you need the chem? you need you need analytical chem? yes i need that i'm probably taking that next year, i'm guessing but you're still in really good shape. yeah okay you can have some fun you can take extra chem even. yeah uhuh, before  good, okay good i just wanted to make sure that everything was working out. do you want me to put um an official copy in your file would that be, cuz i rea- i noticed i kinda gave you all_ you have triplicate you have this in triplicate. sure. okay okay okay what_ i didn't_ what is that? um basically you're gonna talk to, biochem  oh okay uhuh  okay okay  alright, okay. um, and i have one more question. this summer i took a physics and it mhm  and so, that's a heavy load girl for,  yeah i'm not sure what i should do about that. if i should take it over? i mean it's it's general physics. mm a lot of it's gonna depend on your purpose of retaking it. if what's happening is_ you, you know you won't need to retake it, for the biochemistry concentration. that's fine it's just it's not a moment of glory but you've done very well in all of your other, okay okay okay   i have met with her yes. Darlene took a job at Berkeley so she's gone      yeah yeah   right  okay  it won't change your G-P-A at all.  hm'm okay okay  um i'm gonna be here until seven-thirty. okay thank you. okay. okay. so i'm sorry to be so waffling on that.   okay okay. good i'll i'll ask her about that okay great. i think that i'm set then. okay she's real good and real conscientious, good  okay yeah okay well that's_ i'm glad that, things are going well and yeah, i was surprised to th- i guess_ what is senior standing? how many credits?  oh it's eighty-five mhm  uhuh right, exactly. okay thank you very much. you're welcome. and i'm sure i'll see you later i hope so    bye-bye. back in  yep you're free to go and i'll come back when you're done. thanks Janine. um, okay  mhm right and then you got your little homework mhm  right this new chapter, like i'm i'm understanding. and the stuff from before i mean i got a C-minus on the last test, but that's you know partly because there's some st- there are a couple things i was fuzzy on, mhm  well he doesn't he doesn't collect it. oh yeah you were supposed to keep on it yourself.   before the test. yeah before the test mhm i don't think anybody would want that. so i mean is a C-minus equally as bad? no C-minus is a little better than a D-plus, a little yeah right right yeah. okay  right i see right well well w- right but w- so well for the business school th- i- G- G-P-As are usually between like a like a three   doing well is like a B B-minus i mean okay well  cuz that'd be that'd be doing well   mhm  um currently? yeah English, uh God what is it, it's an English class that doesn't count for my_ it  is it two-eighty-five the twentieth-century with um Herman Elmwood? yes okay. you were a late orientee weren't you i saw you at the end of August okay yeah, yeah okay.    right  i got a C-plus. that's okay mhm so you're doing, okay good  no this is the Problems of Philosophy two-thirty-two two-thirty-two. um, and in that class i'm doing alright i think i got, i got a C-plus on the midterm but that was twelve-point-five percent, the grade mhm yeah okay yeah you're doing, pretty  it's just math like if, you know i thi- see like that's the thing like i'd hate to stick with this get like a C-plus on the midterm on the final i mean, and then  question if you were to that stinks well, if i had done this all along then i'd h- probably answer yes, but, um... i don't i don't know i don't think so. okay. so you feel like if you were to stick with the math and keep trying to work to improve and you have to get at least, you said like a B B-minus on the? B-p- B-minus C-plus on the final in order to? yeah most likely a B B-minus really and you_ do you have a tutor? are you going to_ how how are you_ well right i'm doing homework with my friend but to study for the test i'm still kinda, i mean i need to start like fairly qu- fairly soon. yes (even if you) the Tau Beta Pi? yeah those are nice people actually i've heard real good  (okay) i guess (i could) like go back and do like the review problems or something like that but yeah... just (try no-) it's just one of those things i can't make the call for you  yeah cuz  you got it. if you have the energy and math is not sucking you dry you know it's_ occasionally i'll talk to somebody      right  mhm yeah i know i've been there.  yeah yeah yeah oh it would definitely  mhm yeah i don't i mean, i guess my my my i can't make any promises yeah    yeah no i don't i don't think so. and that you can get_ and i and i think if you get a C in this class it's recoverable if you do well in economics and Math  again if you do well in economics and Math one-fifteen, you know again what they're gonna see there is an issue of adjustment and that might even be something that you'd want to address in your Business School essay. mhm oh quite a bit,  yeah right right mhm mhm mhm... okay yeah  yeah yeah okay yeah no i mean i think i could do better  yeah  mhm right (oh yeah) oh wow.   so every time you do homework you should do it three times? yeah but not necessarily three times in a row. first  mhm mhm right no  right and since you missed some stuff you might wanna do all the homework from the week but then go back and review, yeah right  um so they recommend sort of keeping it fresh in your mind mhm mhm mhm   oh i plan to  right   yeah ye-  yeah right  yeah now after you take that final exam, and you get the grade back do you_ can y- is there still time to talk to the G-S-I? or no? like i mean like what i'm saying is like you know like let's say, let's say i'm really close. like like i'm talking, mhm to what end? to ask him to bump you up?   okay mhm right,     so you should have some sort of_     right right right  right right okay and if you need to get a tutor that's another option, although it sounds like you might be okay i don't know we'll see i mean you sure?  yeah no no no no no when you said that you didn't think that it would be too overwhelming to to  well no because i mean i don't, cuz the problem is is like you know and then i gotta take again next semester and it's just, right right. i mean, like i mean cuz i did a lot better on the second test the first test i failed the second test, mhm mhm mhm yeah well that's something to be said for that i mean you're in a class with other first-year students who're all going through similar stuff to you and, right mhm okay um so if you decide to drop the class the last day to drop it is tomorrow. right did i give you a drop form? when i saw you  okay so you have that, mhm  mhm yeah, but um and then the other question i had since you uh you were a literature teacher? uhuh mhm um, well i mean there's lots of different things that you can ask questions about. and it's gonna  mhm um like we're currently reading The Stranger. okay. okay so you got Meraud or Mersault or whatever his name is Mersault  yeah yeah   okay he killed an Arab, mhm uhuh  mkay, what you might want to do in that book i mean it's written sort of in a stream-of-consciousness style yeah  yeah  mhm i'm not uhuh mhm like like i don't know i was just like i don't know he said like you know like read and take notes but how do you take notes well, there's a lot of different levels on which you can understand literature right? there's sort of the basic plot, uhuh right what happens to who where when why the journalistic kinda you know that's like the main-frame stuff and i think with novels that are written in stream-of-consciousness kind of style sometimes the plot can get kinda, at lost especially if you're, cuz i- if you're listening to the story from a deranged person's perspective which you kinda are.  mhm mhm mhm   oh Light, o-   yeah  mhm  (anything) well whatever interests you okay   yeah cool right cuz like i understand what the author is like trying to say, uhuh mhm well and you can't think of everything i mean right well right mhm mhm mhm   uhuh uhuh  mhm    yeah but mhm  yeah, i think that it's good practice to just kinda write questions in a book i always mark my books i mean it's a shame if you plan on selling them back, you know right uhuh uhuh mhm okay   okay um, no not really  mhm yeah and i think if you're feeling as though you know because you haven't had Intro Comp yet, um you really, are feeling anxious about that i would just go talk to him a little bit about you know your concern about the exam cuz you felt kinda at a loss for the last one and, mhm okay right okay  yeah i know i plan to. okay and it's a lot of questions and it's good to see you still kinda i mean i think it's it's you've learned a lot this semester i think yeah and you know it's it's hard work to to do real well here i think... but it's good too because if you can learn this stuff then you can build on it and you know and it would be_ and i've seen people not do so well in pre-calc and then do perfectly well in calc. mhm mhm right  so you have that grade as well. yeah which is good. i hope? group  oh yeah i got i got an A-minus in that. alright well you know you just need that averaged in with those yeah  thanks John (this is) oh no don't worry about it it's cool do i have to like fill this out or something? yeah you need to fill it out (mm) okey dokey okay so i guess you just give that, to her on your way out and hang on to the little, study strategies sheet  yeah i hope to see me smiling too. i hope you do i think i think you can. yeah. well thank you very much. okay you're welcome. i told her today would be busy cuz it was the last day before drop-add so okay well i'm not here for a drop-add class   Celeste  uhuh okay yeah,   my grade came up though good girl oh mhm  yeah    well i joined it but i never did go to my academic advisor ever, okay but  right hm nah, thanks what's the difference between C-S-P Math and regular math? the only difference is that C-S-P Math meets one time a week more often, and there's, more emphasis on quizzes and homeworks and sort of testing you on stuff as you're doing it... so that, there's more support there's more academic support cuz you're getting more academic feedback more often, and as a C-S-P student or C-S-P affiliate whether you're actually taking any C-S-P courses or not you can have um free tutoring and so many students join C-S-P for that. because especially if they're pre-med or they're taking  of course. yes. actually do i have i have a C-S-P ooh look at this i have a C-S-P flyer with M- a note from Manda on it, but we'll ignore the note from Manda, cuz i know she won't be right back. um but they just tell you the courses, intensive course selections, they have course sections offered in bio chem econ English math physics and Spanish. and you have a regular assigned advisor who you're supposed to meet with on a regular basis, if you don't  Elvira Jackson i mean if you wanna meet with another C-S-P advisor you could just switch advisors or you could just see somebody in L-S-and-A it's you know  well you might wanna meet her before you blow her off. mhm i'm trying to figure out what i wanna take cuz i don't know what i wanna take next semester  well you're just a freshman you've been here for not even three months so come on yeah but a lot of people have clues  you just watch and see people will change. what do you like? i like writing. well you might wanna major  what that changed when you got up here? yeah  okay and you_ are you_ you're not enjoying Intro Comp this semester? at all no she's really nice. mkay why aren- you know are you not enjoying it? because it's difficult and they're sort of upping the ante and you're having to do a lot of revision and sort of thinking about why you're saying what you're saying and? it could be the Intro to Comp class that i'm taking cuz it's all history stuff. oh you're taking a writing of history? like yeah  i don't know, it's your class like i know all you do in there is write about_ somebody writes about_ somebody writes a history essay and then i, mhm,   uhuh so it's mostly the topic that you're not really enjoying the topic  hm well the nice thing about being in college_ i know it's nice and also tormenting_ is no matter how good you are, you can always be better, you're  yeah you're just not  more than respectable. i don't know  then i was thinking it's hard to write good stuff all the time. that's true. so then if i did that and i just wrote something and they hated it then i'd do bad you know not necessarily, (xx) that mm, so i don't know. and then i don't know how good i am at creative writing either. well if you took for example introduction to creative writing, that's a class_ it's not for people who are majoring in creative writing it's just a class for it's a freshman-sophomore-level class for people who are interested in learning more about creative writing. so it's not really designed for people who already have undergraduate degrees in creative writing and have published novels and that kind of thing. it's a class for people like yourself who kind of, are thinking you might enjoy this. mhm  no what i mean it's gotta be something, and then it depends on the teacher and   well and generally i would think at the U-of at U-of-M what you're gonna get is they'll find something they like about your writing and then they'll find a couple of things you might wanna do differently or try differently i mean that's pretty much, how people will respond and you have peer response, other students respond, mhm how many credits is it? three. three, did they send out like a little course guide like  oh no i didn't  oh  not really but,  hm what's CRISP? what's CRISP? i don't know what that is well you know when you registered for classes you came w- was_ did you work with Emily Miller? hm who? Emily? who's Emily? she was the C-S-P peer advisor, she has a lot of energy. if you worked with her you'd know it.  does she like toothpaste?  she is very bubbly she has kind of um,  oh  now? yeah Elvira Jackson okay who was your advisor when you came for orientation? some girl that liked toothpaste. okay so you're just tired.  yeah    Jack Thompson. Thompson Jack Thompson. he sent me to some  yeah that's when you CRISPed. oh    um December,  really? uhuh  oh  so for freshmen you're actually  they told it to you in the email did you save your email? yeah it said the tenth or the ninth, after ten. right so that's        and so what you wanna do is go on the computer and look around so you like it sounds like you like creative writing. i would, be decadent you know  mhm anything you wanted to be. probably i mean you'd have really good writing skills, um, i mean what do you want to do? do you have any idea?  well how do you get to be a professor? i was thinking cuz i like okay yeah okay so it's a couple of different options. okay i mean it depends on a professor of what, a professor of creative writing? well maybe   yeah   hm? if you're doing creative writing you're writing, fiction or poetry you're   no but don't professors get paid a lot more? um no actually they don't. they don't? uh'uh, they just work with older students. no way starting salary for a professor is probably about the same as starting salary for a high school teacher, really? really? yeah mhm shoot that just  yeah  um it depends um English professors probably it depends on the school, probably teaching positions start in the in the low thirties, mid-thirties, oh how much do they get paid? well then again     well when you go up for a job like let's say you're looking for an academic job and you're just a freshman you're getting way ahead of yourself.  Deborah   you're just  okay but now you're thinking just money and how m- how can you make_ i mean do you like yes i want to make money i wanna make money but i wanna do something i like alright well let me just tell you this,  did you like i haven't taken science while i was here or math while i was here. what are you taking? are you tak- we know you're taking the writing of history okay. i'm taking Intro to Comp sociology, i like sociology, okay mhm and what French are you in? French one-oh-one that's probably   no tha- no no no no no if you like it now you'll keep liking it,  well you could mhm you get more proficient though i mean you develop skills as you go along there, so maybe okay so that sounds like you might want to take a mathematics class next semester, do you remember what math you placed into? yes i do. okay well then i would take that one. to give you a sense of of how that goes, and you need to remember Celeste that you have all of this year and all of next year to explore. you don't have to be in a rush you can just kinda be like i'm gonna take creative writing i'm gonna take math, the French you gotta keep going with unless  but i heard that people that get, like degrees in English just become teachers and that's it that's not necessarily true, mm mhm  well, i think i like English you can go into  then i was thinking it would be interesting to take like a film class or something like that. okay so it's sounding like good diversity creative writing math, film okay but see i don't wanna take a whole bunch of, fun classes and nothing...   honey you wanna take EECS you're welcome to  i think you need_ i think you're at a point in your life right now where you need to explore, and i think yeah  mhm well in the Business School i mean and that's actually that is a good question because do you wanna go to the Business School is that an option that you'd like? i don't know. because if it is the Business School has some very specific prerequisites that you need to get  yeah  you need calc, so Math one-fifteen, shoot summer hm but see i don't know what i wanna do. right i think if you don't, and can i be a little directive? sure go ahead i think if you don't know what you wanna do chances are the Business School is not what you wanna do because the Business School's not gonna let you explore that much. ooh  no but you'll be able to graduate from you know the University of Michigan's College of Libr- Liberal Arts and Sciences. eh no you're not uhuh i can see that you have been that's good i'm glad. why don't i just get like a regular job? just a regular normal job, like a little business job and wear my little business suits uhuh  ah      i would do it. i know i would too. but there's only really what's right for you. and right now because you're eighteen and you're just arrived,   um you would talk to Career Planning and Placement, ch ch ch and they will have more of these i'm gonna show you this and then i'll_ i can't give it to you right now cuz i only have one in this office but... they have lots of cool stuff on internships. um basically you kno- and you missed the two in the fall but they'll have it again  mhm and i guess all different kinda places ask for students or mhm mostly corporate stuff. the government has some stuff as well, but um... there's not gonna be_ they don't have as much money to send people, around, you know but if you like to write you might wanna to go to this Careers in Print session. what you can do with a you know,  okay overwhelming   yeah... maybe i'll take biology or something. yeah. i don't see why, i mean, in something fun. you know it could just be an interesting course description a lot of students_ there's a lot of biology for non-science majors, there's about ten different biology courses you could take a first-year seminar you could take a big lecture class, yeah  hm mhm no no sorry. i'm happy to talk to you before your classes if you want. thanks okay who's next, victim? me okay i told her already so okay, she's good Yasmin? yeah. that's right yay yep i have a question like you gave me this, form when_ i'll have to   yeah you gave me this when f- when i was at orientation   mhm  term one term two  yep yeah  i take English too. and you have English already oh you're such a good girl. you need the biology, right uhuh   one sixty-two oh okay it's fine. i mean it's not  nope um, i mean if you want to there's absolutely no reason why not to except mm well it_ i would have  physics anyway, right any or like, some people were talking about like, you take the first part of orgo and then during the spring, or summer term     mhm well the nice thing about taking it at Dearborn is your grade would transfer as well. okay it doesn't? 'm'm, i mean it's one of_ if it's easier for you, to take it closer to home right okay (if) the spring half-term would that_ i mean i could finish the_ all of, the rest of the  or if like if i left chemistry for next year and did physics, mhm  you could but you might run the risk of burnout. are you trying to hurry through? i guess i  okay so what_ maybe what you want to do then is to start chemistry... in the winter, okay mhm  if that works. i mean you need to be feeling comfortable is the reason you don't wanna take chemistry and physics together that you feel that that would be too demanding for you? yeah cuz i'm not good at physics   okay okay so but like i can take it at a different school like when would i, like apply, to that and stuff? um usually around March. March? yeah like do i have to apply to the school and stuff like that? i_ over_ usually yes. because i i mean i applied before, but do i have to i have to apply again? it's a different kind of application,  okay visiting okay mhm uhuh right right or even if i, like at O-U? i mean that's like same difference. mhm mhm well the grade wouldn't transfer here but if you took physics at O-U, you would still have a grade it would just be on a transcript from Oakland University. mhm mhm community college okay   right   uhuh  oh so i could take physics next, term   right.   whatever makes you  if you transfer to Pharmacy in your junior year, no. no? okay,  right then      right and um, there is also like, remember i said i was like wasn't sure about computer sci- like i was reading like it's right in there actually mhm  right. and you'd wanna consider  so like i i don't know what classes i would take for that. um i can actually tell you what you should take for that then. although what happens then is you're gonna end up with four really hard-core courses, (okay) but  mhm well you can't take a computer class somewhere else if you're gonna major in computer science because oh right oh okay mhm i'm in Calc Two. next semester you take  okay  okay if like if i just  mhm mhm yes.  no you wouldn't. fr- i mean like the computer science, right um you would be starting the computer science courses from zero. y- and you mean your junior year you wouldn't have had any computer sci- you probably would want to take computer science somewhere along the way. somewhere along the way okay yes, but you would need to_ so you might want to for example, maybe rather than throwing the physics in there now, maybe take biology, and com-  okay yeah, i understand okay but i wouldn't do biology physics computer science no no uh but Math one-sixteen's going fine it's not Math one-sixteen is killing me i am  okay so actually, okay and when you say killing you what do you mean? like i'm getting like a i think a low C,   right  i know  mhm... so consider something in or you know i mean you you're very nicely set up for biology chemistry or physics. just not computer science correct. okay i see so if you like biology or you like chemistry, mhm hello   this is Dana my Peer Advisor hello hi this is Yasmin one of my orientees you live in Stockwell don't you? yeah  Yasmin Yasmin.  oh that's cute and i remembered her name too i'm so proud mhm okay okay   yeah you want me to see if i can help any of these students out here? yep that's cool. thanks. and so by taking it at a different school wouldn't, affect anything, at all? right. not at all okay   that's true.     you think_ mm but like if i started my junior year like all my, all i'd be you'd be taking nothing but computer science baby that's alright computer science and like math. mhm mhm okay   do you have a pen or something? yeah i do. no. (no, no) what's your name? Mona Mona um she wants to_ like will she be able for orientation, with like how_ with the time schedule and things and i told her i'm gonna do the program if she also wants to get a head start on it,  actually   it's just the  do you need any_ 	1
SEM475JU084.json	okay, well just to um, reiterate, last time we agreed that we'd push back the paper due dates from this Wednesday to, the Monday after break, so that's Monday, um March eighth, due in class um, and are there any questions about those, the papers? (the next) papers that are due? they're gonna be a little bit longer than the ones from last time, and i w- i want to reiterate that i'm, i'm glad to meet with people if you want to come to my office hours today after class or, this week. so i'm happy to make appointments. um, and i wanna thank you guys for filling out the survey, it was really very helpful. um, a couple of things came out of it, um one was that pretty much everybody was, in favor of doing more small groups. um, that was that was very popular. so i'm gonna try and make sure that we do some of that, at least once every time in in class. and i think that's_ you know it's something i've been noticing too, it's hard to get people to participate when we're all in a big group. um and i as i said at the beginning of class, a couple of people mentioned that it, it might be easier to to speak up, in the whole class setting if we actually m- moved closer together. i was just wondering if, um if people, thought that was a good idea, we have some definite nos. how about a, how about a show of hands, um, how many people would be against moving, yeah, closer up to the front? couple, a- any people, and how many_ you wanna, wanna try that again? nos everybody in the class nos (xx) sorry sorry,  there we go. huh? um, why don't why don't you two groups break into, two separate ones? alright, we got our  i thought this was the best, the best reading yeah, it is yeah. yeah. it's (xx) it's because (it) gave so many different things to think about, instead of,  yeah  i thought it made sense too. i agreed with him. which one of those, do you think  the first one. yeah i, i don't agree with the  yeah, yeah the first one with the body, thing you know, i mean i think, all the other people who've looked at it have kind of yeah right that was the one we always talk about was kinda like you need the brain and the bo- like they work together. uhuh, at least without the body the brain's not gonna (do) very much either. so, yeah. yeah, i- it won't do anything. i don't know, the last three, yeah they all sorta see the point of view one i think is good except for yeah  well he used an example with three, about like, i think it was like something about watching a movie, oh yeah yeah   is that like what the ro- like robotics (xx) yeah oh, yeah right i mean how c-   yeah uh huh yeah, i don't i agree with four somewhat too i mean,  yeah. like it covers  yeah but still it makes it like nice and  i still  then half of him is dead. i mean i, i think you could  not in the story. right, but i- no i'm wondering like in real life like, do you need a body for the brain to work? like will there still be like, electrical transmissions or whatever going on? well there's no, there would be no blood to send things to, i'm assuming you can find like some kind of vat to put it in, to keep nutrients in. that's why i don't, know, because, that i i_ in terms of the story, uh huh assuming we can function, that is what we have to go with. no i think you could modify four and like, if it was_ could be like any combination of the two or some- i mean something like that? mhm  i don't get what the  yeah, me neither    cuz like  how how are you not? cuz i don't think even like, with his movie theater example i mean yeah you (xx) you_ or whatever but, no one thinks they're actually in the movie. it's like you      yeah um, any of the   what did you get on the last one? like what did you think  yeah yeah. yeah i, wish i knew more about the distinction between the two.  how much time do we (have left?) so why'd he use all Shakespeare names in it? (xx) is that relevant? maybe that's an underlying, it could be it could be. see i just don't_ i don't know what it me- like connected point of view, i don't know what that, what that's supposed to be. like for nu- five? is that, um yeah like she said connected  oh,  corrected. alright, okay (i got that wrong.)   that means it can change right?   it can, is it that it means it can change? it can change but, you're like it could be wrong with where you think you are. i mean the only thing i can think of is that like, in the robotics example, you cou- ma- like you may think you're like actually handling the  like i th- like you can feel (like) like, the different like thing (xx) but do you really think that you are? yeah, that's what  yeah cuz like, (i don't know) no one's gonna be like, (we're moving this stuff ar-) you know   one with the machine. yeah it's re- it's hard to tell, i think, between three and five. mhm i don't understand like, at the end, when he like, he woke up out of the coma and he was li- and     in another (xx) it was like there were the two b- cuz remember it was like, you could s- (he had) the two brains and you could switch back and forth between the two of 'em, right right like, he thought      or he did   yeah cuz he never knew what was his      had been hiding yeah  uh huh. and the second one was thinking, it's it's like i'm trapped and i wanna get out yeah... but did, the first one know that they were different? the first,      (xx)     like something like watching you, yeah  that's a whole nother argument. yeah i think we're gonna do that next. Friday to Friday. i like that they call that STUD.  where did, where would he even come up_ where do these people    so he spends like, yeah just a cern-  i think he has too much time on his hands. it's interesting... that's that's weird, just to like think about that, remote controlled body,  it seems s- so like, possible in the future. because, everything i- is basically like, electrical impulses, that (take) radio signals or whatever everyone could just have, and i- like it's like stretching like the nerves like   i think making the computer program brain that was, a pretty big jump from what they already did. yeah, that was yeah, the only thing that could argue with, like about trying to be would be like dreaming. think about dreams. are you actually (xx) yeah i don't know. cuz like when you're dreaming obviously you're not (thinking of) yourself as lying (in bed,) you know? well, isn't that like the difference between three and five? yeah, i think it i think it is. good call. i think that's i wanna know more about three, five (i don't know about) the other two how you guys doing? pretty  we need more distinction between three and  ah, yeah. i think thr- the difference between three and five is kind of, difficult. i mean, his i- his idea though is that, in um, where your point of view, three is, you are wherever you think you are. so, if you think you're you know down, the tunnel, that's exactly where you are. like she said, uh what if you're dreaming? ah you're aware_ i think that's a that's a very good, worry about the (xx) for, for three cuz i mean, uh huh    right. it's number five seems to en- allow us (sort of) to correct for that unless_ but it's   (where you are)  yeah, where you think where your point of view should be, okay yeah yeah. well cuz i think this one, this is  bring a microphone over here okay, uh lovely conversation i think that a- besides, i think (i) have a lot to talk (about) yeah i  seriously, like i'm just gonna sit here (and) it's like a sci-fi story, like basically yeah, you should just listen to her, (xx) or whatever like, how she talked about how there was like an extra, brain and body it was like reading science fiction but, what exactly are we supposed to talk about? (xx) has anyone (xx) this is? (i don't think) none of us could be recorded (today.) so, so you guys (didn't do it,) did you, read? no, i'm just thinking, am i the only one who read?  hm? um like, just to go through the  okay  okay. did you did you guys like the, like the, the reading? i did, personally, i though it m- l- eas- eas- a little easier to grasp the concepts, mhm yeah do you agree with the first one? yeah. i think so, but...   which one you say? well with the first one  yeah  wait i don't understand the center of gravity thing, mhm yeah, well it's_ if you look on page two-twenty-four where he's where he's stored as, where he's introducing the uh, the idea that he is, that he is t- somehow this, version of the immaterial soul. it's, i think it's actually kind of confusing what he's what he's getting at but, in the scenario he's thinking, okay your connection with your body is severed, and um, you've got this moment of s- thinking oh well, i'm in_ he's got this moment of thinking well basically i'm underground in this tunnel, and i must be sort of dead, but, but that can't be right i'm still thinking, i'm still i'm still somewhere, and he's he thinks well, oh i've got_ it must be, that i'm back in Houston and that, i'm just the brain in that um, tank, that i saw covered with electrodes, that's where i am. and in that moment of saying oh i know, i was wrong to think that i'm underground, unconscious in um, in Phoenix i think it is. um, he's, he's saying look i can't be (un-) identified with my point of view it seems to, it seemed to me, that i was, underground just a minute ago, um, but underground and not and not, in contact with anything, not sensing anything, but i was wrong. actually at that moment when it seemed to me i was, unconscious and i must be in Hou- in Phoenix, i was in fact back in Houston. and it seems to be that, somehow he's thinking that, there's a correct_ he he should, have been, identifying with his brain. um, even, so he was making a mistake, his point of view wasn't wasn't correct. but, why was he making the mistake and why was he, why should he identify with his brain, is less clear exactly what, what um, what makes it correct to say he's (uh) located in one place or another. i think i think that just proves that he's the brain cuz li- like when he says that you know since there's something thinking mhm uh, does, the fifth point, i- that with it being changeable that can account for like okay when they have the two, like the brain and the machine and them being able to like mhm mhm so you wanted to say that the brain theory can't be right. you were you were you, were arguing, you were saying that you we- you thought the brain theory was probably the,  mhm i just think that, i mean from these kind of extreme cases you just can't use your common sense of knowledge of everything, like you just can't say, well you know, this is this and this is (xx) you have t- i i don't think a single answer can ever, (exist) for, (xx,) but i mean i mean, the most, most strongest one would probably be that, the brain is you, or something. i mean i wouldn't, i i don't see any reason for saying the body is, me mhm so what what ex- what arguments does he give against thinking that the brain is you...? he's not very satisfied with that. yeah oh the whole, robbery  mhm... but you wo- you wouldn't, prosecute the brain cuz the people, can't do anything to a brain. it does- it, i mean it doesn't move by itself, (it) you know? yeah, i know yeah you can't yeah that's kinda hard. no but if you had a choice between either defining the body and the, and the brain or the brain as a person, what would you define, would you say that  so his argument there, hinges on what would you punish? would you punish the brain or would you punish the body? but how would you how, i mean one thing i was thinking about, how do you actually punish a brain? yeah, that's what i was that's what i was actually thinking about  mhm   they're just storing it s- someplace else, in the prison. so can you punish the brain and body separately? i don't think so it doesn't seem like it could you stop the brain from s- thinking though? i mean that would be killing  which is, like o- or restricted it from, yeah you could cut the connections   well  would you be able to keep it alive though without like, if you, cut all the connections? yeah, he co- like he could still think, but he just couldn't connect with the body. like he couldn't tell the body to do something. he was still able to think. but you need to keep the connection so that like, the body like lives like, the brain needs to be able to tell the body to breathe, and  that's true  so if you put the body on life support someplace else? well  but this is more trouble than it's wo- no, i don't know, that poses an interesting question... so it's not that the, that the argument he has given against the brain theory is actually, a good one. his argument is where do you who do you punish, the brain or the body? who do you put in prison? well if that's the argument, uh that doesn't show, just because you don't put the brain in prison that the brain, isn't the one, isn't you as the one that's responsible. mhm yeah um, for the third one, like i i didn't quite get it i mean, but where he says that where, the point of view is (whereever) (xx) i mean i couldn't understand what he's saying.  okay. so, i mean isn't a- isn't that true for all practical purposes, i mean even if i'm wrong, i mean who cares whether i know i'm still here. so well, when you're dreaming though you think you're somewhere el- like, when yo- your body is actually in your bed, you think you could be in space and, you know, in (xx) wherever your dream takes you, mhm   i'm gonna go, check on some of the other groups. oh, okay. i don't understand that one   for the past five classes we're just discussing like so, how is the, o- how does he disprove, the point of view? i don't know,  i think he probably would have, corrected it when he said, the soul equaled the b- (on) page two-twenty-four, you  yeah   wrong yeah because   yeah, exactly mhm mhm    yeah well wait is he saying that the soul thing is what he think is cor- what he thinks is correct? mm cuz he said like right here my mood was, on like the top of two-twenty-five,  yeah, sure  okay um... okay guys um, like to get back, back together. and just to to poll where you guys got to in your deliberations, did you, did you guys come up with a with a, with a best answer? (with like) five i think we came up with five. five? that's our best. how come? um, beca- well basically we looked at it as, ki- a lot like three, mhm  mhm yeah. uh, we went with four, more or less. body plus brain? so you're partly, you're partly where your body is right  mhm  okay so you thought his, when the body starts losing contact, the body just, dies, mhm right. what do you right right. well, he's partly in both pl- i mean he's predominately, like most of him, the part of him where, where everything goes on, like everything mhm mhm  okay, so you, you're you're inclined to think that, still before it dies, it's located in two places. yeah. i don't know. before he loses communication with, mhm okay so it just, it travels back and forth depending on where yeah we went with number five as well. pretty much like, the same reasons as them, and, how you said like the severing, mhm so, when yo- when it severs, when the severing comes, he's wholly with his brain, not with, not at all with the the living body that's, just completely disconnected. mhm. i don't think we actually came up with one that we, totally liked. mhm are, you guys were also pretty tempted i kn- i know you were wha- i don't know. i felt like number five combined the two, two and three, like, it's your brain but then it's, i mean it's your point of view but then your brain is what is correcting itself. i don't know if that that helps  cuz it's your point of view, like you said, and then it's corrected, like that's, it's like logical thinking is what's correcting it and that's basically your brain and when, the whole time the perspective, perspective that we're getting is from the brain so, i feel like that's what's, actively correcting, the point of view. well, your brain is doing all of the th- all of the thinking right? yeah. i'm just, i don't know.  mhm. yeah, that was just what we said. mhm. wait, could you say that again? mhm cuz it's not real it's not really happening. your point of view doesn't isn't only like you looking at Mars. it's, what that point of view is is that your body's up there on Mars and you're interacting with things like feeling them looking at them mhm mhm okay so maybe that's a, a new, a different way of understanding what a point of view is. a point of view is where, the place where all of the sensory information is coming in. right.  hm? mhm i don't agree  well, then you could go like, the same thing that happened with uh, (Wira) was it Perry's dialogues? mhm but, that's not really the argument. all it's saying is that, the number three's like, wherever you're thinking you are that's where you are. um, right i think that's i think that's a good point. i think actually both of these are really good points because, um, i had a question that led up, uh about how he, he came about with number five. once the body and the brain got severed and separated, he was talking about, a connection how he was losing the connection mhm   it's supposed to be something just like that. he says it's radio connection, between  yeah. yeah, so think, whatever the, you've got, for all of your i- it's kind of an, outrageously complex and and probably technologically impossible feat,  i don't really i mean, i don't really believe in the whole point of view thing to begin with okay. okay you know, that's okay. you don't have to_ i'm not saying, you know, it's your final considered opinion, it was just, reaction to this point. um, but, just relax alright, what's on top of the ship? just a brain? no, the whole body. the person's there, you know oh like a do it like a, machine is down on the bottom yeah. the machine is down on the bottom, the person is up on top, and she's got, you know, a whole ki- all these levers, it's like a it's like a really high tech video game. mhm i don't think so. i thi- i think for one thing like, cert- she'll have certain sensory inputs from down on the sea floor mhm mhm mhm mhm so she's, the fact that she's already, she's got a point of view, a situated, perspective up on the ship yeah yeah. i agree like temporarily like she feels that but, mhm mhm so she's always sort of   mhm. would it make a difference do you think if you, if she went into a sort of a trance? you know you_ people can get so concentrated on what they're doing that, you know y- you, you nudge them or you you you you you say something to them and they just, they c- completely ignore you. if she was so bound up in in what was going on under, under the sea, would it make sense then? would it be like having a remote controlled body? can you, i mean is temporarily a a, an acceptable answer? yeah, well i think with the, i mean, the the shifting center of gravity point of view, um, is something that, that that can change, that can move from one place to another in an instant. i mean that's what Den- Dennett's idea was, is that at the, at, during this example where th- the body is under, underground, in Tulsa um, and also when the connections start shif- start going on the fritz, he says well look it just it sh- his center of gravity shifted in an instant, back to, um, back to the vat. it didn't take any time, it doesn't you know, there's no material transfer of anything that has to take place... so looks like you know the the the time it takes, or the time aspect doesn't, and distance travel doesn't make any difference t- for this kind of, for this kind of view to, to work. i'll do it. okay, um, also people su- someone suggested, that we might just give, a sign up sheet and let you sign up beforehand for, um, the rest of the, the presentations. um, would that be, would people like to do that or would you like to continue doing it sort of on a, um, after we've had a chance to do the readings for the week? let's do a sign-up sheet. let me, let me take a vote. for of, how many people haven't done a presentation so far? okay, of the people who haven't done a presentation so far, how many would like to do sign-up sheet now in advance of the readings, and versus how many people would like to wait until we do the readings, so, sign-up sheet now? how many people for a sign-up sheet now? one? two two? how many people for wait, three. three.    oh whoops, no, i, i'll go for the wait and see. wait, wait and see, that was one two three four. oh, i think the wait and sees have it, um can you send me around a sign up sheet please? i'd like to know (xx) when would you like to? um, i'd say, mid March, to late March. um... no the, no actually (we didn't do this) the last time, but one thing to, one thing to, that i'd like to, to go (through then) is the is the plausibility of the second scenario. could you have, could you have two (controlling centers) in one person, um and secondly, is it plausible to think that, a computer, could be a real (xx) a real control (center, the com-) a computer would be a person. uh, because he's assuming that as he switches back, (from) one, one brain to another, artificial brain, it doesn't make any difference... did y- do you two know each other? i'm Pearl i'm Max um, so we were just talking about what to concentrate on next time. um, um two things to, to think about is, to, how plausible is this case as, is it plausible to think a person could have two different control centers, and still be one person? the spare brain idea, is that even a s- a starting point? um a second kind of idea. one of these brains, brains quote unquote, is supposed to be a computer. could a computer actually be a person? could it have thoughts and feelings and (xx) could that even be part of_ could it be a person? could it be part of a person? um, so that's another uh, another worry. um, and then a final worry is well, what should, what should what kind of a theory should we think is true in order to, you know describe this person? is it, if we take Dennett's word and it's one person, two brains, one artificial one real, um, is it the point of view, number five that he's appealing to here? (are we) applying the, the theory  (xx) okay okay. and um Grace is sick today,  okay thanks. i hope she's, feeling better. it's a bad time to be sick. so, okay do you have my Parfit, uh sheet (that i handed in?) oh um, yes i do. where is it? it should be in my bag. 	1
DIS280SU058.json	okay. first i just do a (xx) uh why don't you put, on the if it eh if it didn't pass on the (slope,) on the production function you don't have E? yeah, sorry. that's good. i forgot to put E in because we just add this E, into the model. right we usually have L. but i just wanted the full model. so good question. thanks. for, number five, we have saving equals to investment in closed economy remember? in closed economy with no government. savings is gonna incr- equal to investment. so. what exactly does that mean again? th- this is, the growth rate of the capital per effective unit of labor. you wanna see, how the change in effective unit of labor contribute to growth. okay? so that's why you need this equation this is the whole solo model, this equation. tells you the whole thing. okay? so last time we put this in graph already, right? we have this graph, production function scaled down by saving rate, which gonna be the same, just like lower, because saving rate is gonna be less than one, and you know this is the shape of production function. okay? so we have this. straight lines slope of delta plus N plus G, K-T. this is K-T. in Mankiw book, in the book, they ju- they did it in three steps. they do it in three steps. they do it, first, with fixed labor, okay, so you don't have any N. N equals to zero, G equals to zero for the first step. remember? professor, the professor went over this too. so this equation, you're not gonna have N plus G. right the picture is gonna be the same. the second version, they're not including E yet. they left E out. you have only, N and the f- plus the first version. so this what you have. and the model we're doing right now is the final step so we have everything. so if you wanna do, the first two steps just take this out. and you have the same picture still. see that because this is just a slope. right? it doesn't affect anything else. so, from this, you get K-star. why? because in the steady state, okay, in the steady state, K stop growing, little-K. and little-Y too. because, Y equals to a function is a function of K, if K stops growing. the little-Y is gonna stop growing too. see that? so, in steady state, this term is zero. right? see that? so this term equals to this term, as a- the investment has to equal to the depreciation. that's when you don't get any change in capital. you have just stable capital. that's, represent by this point this K-star. okay? we have that, and if you away from K-star you going back to it remember? if you are on, on the right hand side, on the left hand side your left hand side, oh my left hand side. your left hand side. oh. this is left hand side of K-star. you're gonna have an investment which is F, S-F-K greater than, the depreciation. so you're gonna have, a positive, change-in-K so your K is going up. if you're on the right hand side, you're gonna have depreciation, over investment. right? these change gonna be negative and you're gonna have a fall in K. this is the definition of steady state. if you away from it, you coming back to it. if you at K-star you're not gonna go anywhere you're gonna stay there because that's not gonna be any change in capital. okay? now this is easy. comes to, the hardest, the harder part. which is the convergence rate. okay? the convergence rate in this case is the convergence rate, from any point in this line to K-star. we need to use the law of diminishing marginal product of capital again. if you have, small amount of capital, adding one more unit of capital, gives you a large output. but if you keep adding more and more capital, that extra output is gonna decrease. right? even though you still have an increase in output, that increase is to- is smaller and smaller. as you keep adding capital. this is the same thing. if you are here okay? if you are at this point, you have very low level of capital. if you av- if you add one extra unit of capital you gonna have high, unit of output. high extra output. this mean you have a high growth. high convergence rate. to K-star. but if you keep getting closer and closer to K-star, your increase in output is falling... right? so your convergence rate is falling and falling, when you getting toward K-star. and when you get to K-star what is your growth rate? zero. right? at this point, K stop growing. little-Y stop growing. same thing. on this side, if you further away, if you decrease your capital by one unit you decrease output by a lot. so the convergence rate, on this side, is high too even though you have a decrease your convergence rate is negative. but in absolute value. it has to be big. and it's getting smaller smaller in absolute term. until it gets to K-star. the further you goes from, K-star, the bigger convergence rate. okay? i know it gets, hard it's hard for me to kind of.... i talk about Mankiw thing, let's do the growth rate. let's see whether, if we in steady state what's gonna happen. we know that little-K and little-Y stop growing. what happen to all these big-Y big-Ks and savings and, wage, rental rate. okay? i did a lot of example here. i don't know if it's gonna be useful but, i hope so because Ricardo is writing a final on this part. and he's very mad. so we must be ready, for that. N N yes what is change-in-E over E? G G, right? so. the growth rate of the big-Y is, N plus G. okay? on your notes it looks like you have m- you have  oh. should that be plus? oh no no no because  oh okay okay yeah  yeah it's N plus G because it's equal to_ the growth rate is equal to the greater of L, plus the growth rate of E. so it's N plus G. okay you're getting better. now this is the hard one. this big-K-T. are we doing the same thing? in here. we define little-K-T, i just leave it out, big-K or L-E, okay? so big-K is gonna equal to little-K-L-E. right? what is the growth rate of big-K? what is the growth ra- the growth rate of little-K. zero N N, what is the growth rate of E? G G. so it's N plus G. know the trick now? okay good... number four... savings. saving is S, times big-Y... the growth rate of savings. it's gonna be equal to the growth rate of little-S, plus the growth rate of little-Y_ big-Y. sorry. so, what is the growth rate of little-S? zero zero. what is the growth rate of big-Y...? N plus G. right? so saving grow, at rate_ saving grows at rate N plus G. okay? so, the L-dot equal to L e- multiplied by exponential N, T is Ricardo's way. the growth rate thing is my way, and this is Professor Basu's way. so pick every one you want_ any one you want. but don't do Ricardo i think it's too much t- i mean he's too good. we kind of like this level. i'm kind of like this level. okay. well this is easy too but this is like, the sure thing. you're not gonna miss anything from here. okay? i'm in between. okay investment since investment equals to savings, the growth rate of investment has to equal to growth rate of savings too. right? so, growth rate of investment is just N plus G again. okay? but don't try to guess in multiple choice. like most of them are N plus G but you know. try to figure it out... well the next couple of, of this derivation is dealing with number eight. so let's do, number eight in the problem sets. okay? i think it's more useful to you and to me.  no i don't think so okay. i don't think so. i hope not. i'll fight for it.  (marginal)  what's the difference between little-R and big-R like how,  and big-R.  N plus G  um, when you divided K over L by L-E, mhm no you don't have to why because it's the same thing as you multiply it by one. this is one right? L-E and L-E's one. okay okay...? that's number, that's that's question B, well since W_ this is labor share, labor share is equal to one minus capital share. so it's gonna be one minus this. one is constant, this is constant, so the labor tax also gonna be constant. right...? now, for the total payment of labor. i think you can do it better now. let's see. the uh, total payment of capital. sorry. what is the growth rate of R? the growth rate of R is, the R is M-P-K. M-P-K is F-prime K. so the growth rate of R is, zero, right? and the growth rate of K is, N plus G. so, there you have the growth rate of R-K equals to N plus G. okay? or, if y- i wanna do it my way, R-K, is gonna be equal to constant, i mean we already proved that R-K over Y is constant, on B. in problem B right? so, R-K equal to constant, times big-Y. the growth rate in R-K, do it my way, is gonna equal to the growth rate of the constant, which is zero. plus the growth rate of Y, which is, N plus G. same thing. taking like extra three minutes. okay...? what about the payment to labor? in this case it has to be W-L-E because we're paying by effective labor unit. i should put L-E here too... well but it's not gonna change any result anyways. okay? so. you'll be doing the same thing. W-L-E over Y is gonna be constant, right? so, W-L-E equals to constant times Y, the growth rate of W-L-E is gonna  uh, no. no. no?  zero zero zero what is the growth rate of little-Y? zero zero. in steady state. so the growth rate of C over L, is just G. okay? C-star yeah. because we care about consumption, so whichever steady state that give you the maximum consumption. you go for it. okay? so. i der- i think i derived, the condition of the steady state, Professor Basu did it once in lecture i did here again, it's just the maximum_ the maximization thing, you have, C-T equal to Y-T minus little-I-T. okay? and this little-I is, S-Y-T. what is S-Y-T? i erased it again. oh. S-Y-T at the steady state. now we talking about steady state now. s- Y is equal to this term. so we can substitute Y-star i'm gonna change it to star now, minus, N plus G plus delta, K-star. and these little-Y-stars, we can substitute in F, of K-star right, because they're equal. why? we wanna find the K-star that maximize consumption, so we have to change the parameters in this equation to be K-star so we can maximize over it. so now maximize consumption function. you take derivative of this function, set it equal to, zero. right? so. take derivative F-prime K-star, equal to, well minus N plus G mi- plus delta, equal to zero. you have F-prime K-star, equal to N plus G plus delta. this is the condition for golden rule steady states. it is the K-star where, your F-prime K-star at that point equal to the slope, of the straight line. so let's see which, point is this? it is, over there. okay suppose now you care only about K-star. this is all you care about. K-star. you in, steady state. this is still your production function, F, K-star, and you can draw the line, N plus G plus delta, K-star. okay? now. the condition is the slope of this production function. has to equal to the slope of this line. that mean the golden rule steady state has to be, where the slope, whe- when you draw the line, touches the slope of production function, it has to be parallel. to the straight line. something like, over here, right? because the slope here, equal to the slope here. satisfy the condition. so, this is your K-star golden rule. at this K-star you maximize the consumption in the economy. okay? if you away, f- if you are away from this, you're gonna have less consumption either way. if you come toward this point toward the right hand side, it's gonna be, this is the consumption. right? why? because consumption, where is it? equal to F-K-star minus, the depreciation. this is, Y this is F of K-star this is depreciation. so the difference be- between the two, is your consumption. this is the maximized consumption, maximum consumption, if you go further, to the right, it's falling. if you go further to the left it's falling. okay...? any question on, the golden rule, of steady states? okay. less mhm so how can you, like if you want, oh you can't_ i'm just trying to bring them,  down. down, because you're gonna increase consumption forever. right? and that's a picture that we did yesterday in class too. your consum- your consumption's gonna jump up, and stay there forever. and if you on the left hand side, you want saving rate to go up or down?   um, in the article, mhm mhm yeah  oh you're gonna talk about that? yeah. yeah. definitely. um, only question i have is like, like, if uh, you have uh, people moving out, mhm no. let's let's look at it as one time moving now, see what i'm saying? like you have just... the population growth is just like, when they calculate, they calculate over years right? but, for this, uh for this part, it just like, well let's, what if they migrate for a month? like for this month, ten thousand people came in. so it's not gonna, well we not gonna, have them affect a lot of population growth. let's let's make it that simple. okay? so let's make it that L change, but N is not changing. because N is just the growth rate right? so, hm, in th- the average growth rate of every year. suppose this year you have, three percent next year you have two percent. you can have fo- four percent this year and one percent next year and you have the same average amount of, N. we assume N to be constant right now. i mean we can change N but if you change N, it's gonna tilt, if_ i think it's number seven. that you have to do. but for immigration. i don't think it's gonna affect, that much. like in case of West and East Germany. right? they're not really_ i don't know if they really migrate they can just still go back and forth. like, they probably cross the border and come_ and work and then go back. but try to keep it simple that, N is not changing because otherwise your analysis gonna go crazy. like. because you have, you know, Y goes down and you have N, shift your, straight line again. see what i'm saying? if you have a migration, an immigration, if you let N change you have to let this change too. you can't just do a simple analysis anymore. it's not that, complicated but you know it's, a little bit... not easy, okay? but you can put it in your analysis too if you already put it there. it's fine. it's fine. just make assumptions. if it's gonna change or not but i'm not gonna let it change in this case. until_ unless you are told, you know that, N is changing from zero to, ten percent something like that. if not just immigration, just let N, to be like, quite constant. because we're not gonna go this far we're just gonna look at the production function. to see what happened to Y and per capita Y. okay? well let's see if i can apply that too... hm. okay let's, let's start with number, two. i'm gonna start with number two first. and then we'll come back to the, immigration problem when we get to number, number three. you have to, i didn't, i didn't put down, i don't wanna kill more trees. they have similar saving rates, population growth, depreciation rate and, G-D-P. yes, exactly. because you know that K-star is a function of those parameters. G N delta and S. right? if they_ if the two countries has the same lev- level of those rates, or, when do th- when you do some manipulation and those rates. give you exact same K-star. as the other countries. then definitely in the long run you know in the long run you have to get to K-star. and if you have the same K-star, you gonna converge, right? so first you must have the same K-star to be able to converge to the same point first. okay? so that's the condition. any other, comments? questions...? Jenny? would_ i don't know this just eh this is another idea that struck me is like natural resource endowments like how would that affect that like if, say one part of the country had like a lot more, um, goods. where they ever, like oil for example. like oil natural resource? would that affect  this probably affect the convergence rates. like okay okay okay  okay mhm no who think it's a no? oh i said yes. okay um what's the effect on total output? like i know like the, the like the total output? yeah like like the poor country's total output, like i know like, that its per capita income would like catch up like will increase mhm let's see. total_ what is to- what is, the little-Y? okay the per capita income. per capita not per effecti- unit of labor i lost my chalk. Y over L, is your per capita income, but if you have E here you're gonna have, little-Y here. or you can look at this, even. if this is going up, and given that labor is not falling, what happen to output? it'd  but i thought the reason why per capita like, cuz labor actually fell. why,  oh no no no no no. no no no no no we not... we we look at the immigration on the West Germany side. okay yeah okay well, i stress more when we go to three and four. okay doesn't that undo (xx) the capital that they had, before they, when they ha- were separated countries? because it said now they are uh, they have the same government and the same policies. but, it's now. what about before? before we knew that West Germany had less capital than yes  yes policy eh East less_ East  so it doesn't matter this? it doesn't matter where you start. right? it doesn't matter where you start. you gonna go_ you gonna converge. to each other. maybe_ why? you know why? because when you look at this, okay look at this. look at this picture higher higher. right? once you get nearer to K-star, your convergence rate falls, right? so here has to be slower the convergence rate for West Germany has to be slower, than East, Germany anyways. so it's gonna catch up, in the long run. see what i'm saying? and, and even though it's not gonna catch up, by the time West Germany get there, but if German- West Germany, are at K-star they stop growing. they just gonna be there. and finally, East Germany's gonna be able to catch up anyways. right? because West Germany's gonna start here at K-star. and East Germany's gonna come. and catch up later anyways. okay? so finally they have to converge. seven hundred years, you can say.   goes up goes up yes. Y equals to F-K-L, if L goes up... definitely. Y's gonna go up. because of what because we have the f- fourth derivative e- it's greater than zero. so increase in L increase Y. increase in K increase Y. but, if we divide it by L, L, L, we can do that because we have constant returns to scale function, right? it's gonna be Y equals to, F-of-K. right? now what is this small-K? it went up N plus G N plus G good. so if N goes up, the growth rate is going, up. so big-Y is going up. so same result... okay? so if you can just well you know, if this immigration is large enough to change the population growth, you still have the same result... okay. that's for labor. let's do it for capital. well, wait. now, what does it mean it means that, in West Germany... you have a fall in output. so you have a slower growth right? if... if West Germany is going to K-star, and East Germany is catching up, if West Germany is slowing down, the two countries gonna converge faster, right. so, the immigration actually speed up the convergence of the two countries, too. see that because it's slowed down the growth rate of West Germany a little bit, okay? that's one thing. that's for labor. let's look at the capital what happened? if West Germany, lend the money or capital, to East Germany. to finance their investment so they can invest more and have more capital accumulation... when they have more capital accumulation, okay...? i don't know why i erased that picture what about when they have to pay 'em back. i  are you having uh, office hours now? i don't have my office hour today. i'm n- , i'm gonna have my office hour, i'm move my office hour from, on Wednesday to Thursday because i have  next week Thursday oh i though you said on Tuesday yeah, no. okay and yeah i said what i wanna say in the back page of your notes... did you look? is it  is this just this section? no. oh yeah. you're right my section's this one? yeah oh okay this is your section. yeah... oh that's oh oh oh. yeah 	1
DIS150JU130.json	okay um, this is the planetarium and (i'm trying to get this to work here...) this is the evening sky in Ann Arbor as it will look tonight at about, seven P-M. are you serious? the zenith the zenith. okay? and we've got a line that runs, from north to south, passing through the zenith what do we call that? meridian the meridian, and if i've got stars, uh crossing, which way are they gonna cross this way or this way? to my point of view will they move from the east to the west or the west to the east? east to west east to west. okay if i start here, and i draw a line, all the way around the base of the dome, what's that line going to represent? the equator? um actually, no.        Ursa Minor (xx)? Ursa Minor, it's part of Ursa Minor, and what points to it? Ursa Major Ursa Major. okay and, we find those in the northern part of the sky,  mhm okay so the Big Dipper_ in winter it's standing on its tail. so the tail's down here, and here's the dipper, and we use these two stars here, to point, to Polaris. now there's actually nothing very distinguished about Polaris it's very dim, and it's not particularly exciting. but, everything in the sky rotates around that because that's very close, to the North Pole. so i'm going to crank this around and hope that you don't get sick.   oh shit make it go really really fast. okay so that's how the sky is going to move, a couple of other things that we can do in here, um, this is a representation of, the, grid, that we use to divide the sky, so these lines that run, north south what do we call those? declination declination, and the ones that run this way? right   the ecliptic. so they're not lined up, and, another thing to look at, no not that, there we go. uh, this line is running across the meridian so if we start at the base here we've got zero ten twenty, degrees all the way up to ninety degrees being at the zenith, Polaris, what number is Polaris associated with? forty-two forty-two. and forty-two is what... forty-two degrees of... altitude. oh twenty-six yeah about twenty-six, and this one would be at, (be at) eighty eighty degrees of altitude. so altitude is determined by the observer. just like circumpolar stars, a star can't say oh i'm circumpolar, all the time, because circumpolarity depends on the observer. to somebody at the North Pole, there are gonna be a lot of circumpolar stars. and somebody at the equator isn't going to see many at all. or won't see any. so circumpolarity and altitude and things like that are defined by where you are, observing from. so, um, what we would find if we went outside tonight, there are_ i know this is a stellar course, so we're looking mostly at stars, but there are a few planets that are really really bright right now, so you ought to be able to find those. if we went out, and it's, six or seven P-M so just after it's getting dark, if we look over here to the southwestern part of the sky, about here, there will be a very, bright object, that's larger than any star that you'll see in the sky, any guesses on what that would be? Jupiter nope not Jupiter  Saturn? not Saturn, good guess Venus? Venus. yeah it's gonna be Venus. so that'll be over here, and the other two that were mentioned Saturn, and Jupiter will be over here. oh yeah i noticed  so if you look here like if you look just a little bit aways from it so that they're slightly out of the corner of your eye you'll be able to see them. it's because our eye doesn't have enough receptors, uh if you look directly at something, uh it loses its sensitivity. huh hunter hunter. kay so he's a hunter so he's got a couple of weapons with him, but what we see he's wearing a belt, and, these four points, here, form a rectangle and we can imagine that they are being, cinched by this belt so he's wearing a tunic, cinched by a belt. dangling from his belt, is a scabbard, and actually, they- it looks like there are three stars that make up the sword here. the middle one is the Orion Nebula. so, uh that's another thing if you've got a telescope it's a lot of fun to look at, and in this arm, you go out to his elbow here and out to his hand. uh, this is a club. so he's carrying a club. and, in this hand here we see four stars that are kind of curved. that's his shield. so in his right arm he's got a club, in his left arm he has a shield. and, there are two stars here that are bright enough that we, should learn what they are. this star up here is called Betelgeuse. and uh, anybody heard of that name before? yeah yeah yeah. the Disney cartoon or Disney movie was named after that star. this star is very red, so, it tells you right there that, this star is relatively cool. and this star down here_ oh i didn't even tell you what this_ this is his right shoulder, or his right armpit, you know he's holding the club up so, that's Betelgeuse and then down on his left side, this is his left leg or his left knee or his left foot, depending on who you talk to, and that is Rigel. so we've got Betelgeuse and Rigel, anybody know what Orion is hunting? a bear? kay not hunting a bear dang cuz of Ursa that's why    dang   Taurus. Taurus is a bull. and that is who he's fighting. what we're going to do is, the belt is here, we'll go to the right, and we get to this star, this is Aldebaran, and Aldebaran is the eye of Taurus. Taurus is a little bit unfortunate, uh in the way he's drawn. but he's got two very distinguishing features and those are his horns. and, if we start at Aldebaran, and we move out here, that's one horn, we move out here, that's the other horn. now what we notice, okay. height of horn, height of Orion. no no he has with him two companions what kind of animals are they? dogs dogs so he's got two hunting dogs with him, we can get to the first hunting dog by following the belt down to the left, and this star is Sirius, Sirius is the Dog Star, by nickname and Sirius other than, the moon and the planets is the brightest thing that you'll see in the sky, so tonight Sirius will be very bright, and Sirius is part of Canis Major the big dog. and this is actually drawn pretty well. up here we have the head, and if Sirius is the eye, these four stars are his ears, and these four are his mouth. so he's yapping at something, so his head is very large, then these stars form his backbone, and his tail, and his back legs are here and his front legs are there. so a big head and a little body. can we call see how that works? yeah those are basset hounds. no they're not basset hounds  aren't they some sort of terrier? they're Scottish terriers. Scottish terrier. i think it looks like a Scottish terrier. so you can make your own decisions about that. the other, dog we get to when we start_ these are Orion's shoulders, so we start up here, and if we go to the left, through Betelgeuse and keep going, we get to this star here, and it's pretty bright, and the star's name is Procyon, and cyan means blue, so it's a bluer star. Procyon part of a very complex, constellation, kay? watch out. mhm a helmet helmet nope good guess though another guess? an orange safety hat? a safety hat that would probably be wise but he's not that advanced. (xx) seriously that's what they wear.   hm? mhm yeah        Taurus Taurus and riding on his back? (xx) Canis Major Canis Major the big dog and the star is Sirius, and Canis Minor, this star is, Procyon. and what we find Procyon, is on the same side as Pollux. and Castor the other twin, is on the same side of the sky as    horizon so there's homework due next week? homework is due in two weeks. oh okay not in one week. and we'll still wait another two minutes for people to show up. i had somebody, this is my fourth semester teaching and my first semester, like the third week of lab, a person in the back was like uh, we didn't go over this in lecture. like yeah yeah we did this morning. no we didn't i i know i was there and it turned out he was in the wrong place he was supposed to be next door, so we don't want to go three or four weeks till we discover we're in the wrong place. oh 	1
LEL565SU064.json	okay let's just begin with a couple of announcements of, logistical issues. um, some_ um one of you emailed me and, and asked that the readings be, uh that the questions be tagged to the reading so you know where to look for answers to the questions. and, starting next week (uh) i'll do that. uh there're some questions which sort of straddle, the reading as a whole, and so you won't always see that but to the extent that i can do it, i'll, try to tell you, the the reading to go to to answer to your questions. um, and someone else uh tried to get to the Wall Street Journal article that was, uh recommended reading for for this week uh and couldn't. uh now the problem with this is that you have to actually do this from a U-of-M machine. so i think it needs to be in, one of the computing clusters or in the residence, from from the residence hall. and the reason is that the University has sort of a site license to, to use this stuff but the host at the other end needs to know that it's a U-of-M machine. so i think if (you're) if you're trying it from home it won't work. uh unless you live in the residence hall. did anyone actually try, to get at this article? (xx) yeah did you were you? (yeah) it said i needed a password. yeah yeah and wh- where did you try it from? it was from a U-of-M. it was from Angell Hall. yeah. yeah (wow) i did it in the dorm and i couldn't get it either. it didn't. (xx) yeah um, the way i did it was, i went to the, library, website, yeah okay ah okay. then that's... that is that's one thing to figure out um but that's probably too much work it's not worth that. so what i'm gonna do is just, dump the um, the article, on (t-) in my space and then just create a link from within, my page to the article so that would solve that problem. there's a copyright issue here which, you know you're not supposed to access it if you're not, U-of-M but, that's_ we take that chance for a few days... um okay the the textbook issue, uh i've placed a copy of, the the Hughes Martin and Shallock the Understanding Classical Sociology book on reserve, and those books are on order, and and should be here by Friday. uh in any case i'll have copies, like photocopies of the readings for next week uh available on Thursday for folks who, who don't have the books. but hopefully that problem won't bother us for much longer. um, also s- a few of you uh wanted the lectures to be available online, uh, and i'll do that starting next week. uh there's a_ i'm, not quite sure what s- sort of format to to use for it so let me ask you a couple of questions. how many folks use, primarily uh the IBM machines IBM-compatibles...? okay and the rest of you use Macs? mhm how do you pronounce that? that word with the B? uh, bourgeoisie? bourgeoisie yeah yes uh, yeah it's uh unfortunately a French, a French word, but bourgeoisie means, originally the the term refers to someone who came from, a a burg B U R G which is, which is just a word for a town or a a city. so originally it literally meant uh someone who lived in in cities. we'll see Marx using it in quite, in quite a different sense and we'll get to that... okay now before we jump into, into Marx let's ask this question again that we pose at the beginning of the class. why should we care? this stuff happened a few hundred years ago, uh, it's not clear that it affects our lives at least day to day directly, although i think, hopefully as the course goes on you'll you'll see that it does, but, basically why should we, why should we care? now one reason is of course good old-fashioned intellectual curiosity which is why, at least some of us are here. let's put that aside and assume that's not sort of, enough. why else should we care? one way to to think about this is that maybe what's happening today around us is_ are changes which might be about as, big and as important as the changes we talked about, last week. now how do we know this? we know this because, all kind of folks are talking about, about this stuff and they use words like globalization or a new_ the information age. the information revolution. uh the decline of, the working class the industrial working class. um, you'll see this in the papers on TV, uh, and you know hopefully you know i mean even in movies. so maybe something is happening now unfortunately we won't really know till it's all over. uh people who were alive during the Industrial Revolution, some of them had, had some sense of exactly what was going on but really the Industrial Revolution gets called the Industrial Revolution once it's done. um, and so that's somewhat unfortunate that means, in in another class like this maybe in another fifty years we might be able to say for a fact that what's happening now is a big change. so maybe it is maybe it isn't. but i'm going to make the argument just for fun that maybe it is. and we_ because it's happening day to day in small steps we don't really feel it in a big way. um, but maybe there's there's something to this... think back to the steam engine which is the last thing we saw last Thursday. and here's one machine that, single-handedly is responsible for massive social changes. not just changes in how we make things but in changes in how we relate to one another. that's one machine... arguably the s- the the role that the steam engine played back then is being played by, electronic machines or or the computer. basically any digital technology. certainly this is how a lot of folks talk about it. now if that's the case, if you make an analogy with what the steam engine did, then we ought to be able to make some analogies with what the computer is doing, to people, uh to work. this is actually one of the things some of you could pick for, one of the long uh questions on on the exam because, that's kind of, part of the spirit of it is to apply this stuff, to things which are going on now... so what are some of these, these changes? let's say if you compare the way you think about, your work and your day-to-day life, compare that with how your parents talk about, when they were growing up. are there things you can point to that are, that may or may not be related to, the development of this technology that sort of, sometimes strike you as being significant? (Amin) yeah. typewriters. yeah  right. so that that that's a great example just the entry of text. has speeded up a lot yeah registering for classes. and and all my friends they had to go they had to go to different tables and say, i wanna sign up for this class instead we just, go into the lab pick our class and call up that's is that's right another (xx) yeah this is a little less student-like. but um, my co-workers at work um, where it used to be, it was just people in the same building, the people i work most closely with they're in, Chicago or England or Germany or India. that's that's, another great example um, if you make a technical support call to Hewlett-Packard or Microsoft these days your call is just as likely to go to Ireland or to India as it is to, Silicon Valley or wherever Washington, uh i mean the state Washington. uh, and you wouldn't know it but that's what's that's what's happening yeah. other things? other examples...?  right. right right um, i mean take even this, the way we organize this class we aren't even making full use of this stuff. but, the whole idea of giving you, uh links to files that exist, they_ i mean you don't even have to know that, the server that you, you clicked on for the for the, for the Marx and Engels Reader's in in England. i mean, it doesn't have to_ it's_ you should be indifferent to that. um, and to compete (xx) s- say that to compete with the United States? okay, yeah. to compete economically with the U-S, among, among other countries... so that it's easier to trade, within their borders so that they don't have to pay customs duties, within, s- when goods move from one country to another, so primarily for economic reasons it seems. uh, though there are others... so maybe fifty or a hundred, or two hundred years from now, folks will look back on this period and say, you know taking a class like this and on the transparency it will say, this was a revolutionary age. maybe. and and if that's the case then we are living through it right now. and if that's the case, then maybe this stuff, might be useful. because these are the closest to us in time. these are the closest folks we have, who dealt with such big questions. in in the way that they did. so maybe what they had to say then, has something to say about us now... so that's that's something to think about, because it's fun, and also because that's the kind of thing that's, uh that i expect you to think about, for the long questions on the exam. which are not strictly about, an interpretation of the readings per se, but, your application of, the material to something that's going on now. so this this would be a good time to just, you know collect ideas in your mind. you don't have to do it formally. but, just start thinking about these examples. and this is a very partial list. there's, there's qu- i mean if you started thinking about this you'd, come up with, with quite a few, okay any questions up to this point? there you go.  ask your question again and so that, everyone can can hear it (xx) i just asked the question that  no okay if uh, if you know this big revolution occurred the Industrial Revolution and the Enlightenment, i personally don't see how much, much anything has changed since before, uh these th- revolutionary Enlightenment, uh most everybody worked, for a small part of the population, and now after the revolution, most people still work for a small part of the population. okay that's a great question. did you guys catch it there? yeah okay. so if you'll allow me just, rephrase it a little bit... machine?  i think i remember, reading that, one of these things. yeah i like underlined it... somewhere i think mostly that it was that... it takes forming classes and it (kind of) (xx) it was revolutionary because it takes two classes instead of multiple. it was more like people that owned, the factories (or) whatever and then all the workers, even the people like before, capitalism people that had_ like that were talented in their trades were given higher pay, were considered higher than ordinary (day) workers whereas after (Engels and) (xx) and (everyone else) was giving it a try and you know with capitalism everybody was on the same level, you would pay them the same amounts, you worked at the same (xx) i mean, yeah except that like between the two classes like the, like some people were paid, like they weren't really paid for their work.  mhm mhm (xx) (Industrial Revolution.) do you have any thoughts? i mean i just wrote up, wrote this, wrote up on this book, so um it's already_ oh is it used? yeah but i'm_ i did a lot of the writing in here, just trying to get the general point, i didn't know how far to read so i, i accidently read, damn near up to here. man he was a true communist. so how do you think... the (uh bourg-) was, played a (roles) revolutionary part? (xx) yeah. yeah i just find where, where the sentences (xx)   oh yeah well, in in a way those who are oppressed have been like inspired, pushed by the bourgeoisie to like, try harder to like want equal democr- some sort of a democracy. yeah (kind of) see right, right here it says, yeah right right so it just naturally is polarization of classes? yeah. it was just   the proletarian is one of like the working class the laborers that wanted change. (and) the proletariat (is) made up of (a) very large part, yeah, that's bourgeoi- is that how you say it? i don't know. bourgeoisie. the bourgeoisie was a very minimal amount of people. there was only, there was_ it was very small it was the minority and that's what the whole thing was was that the minorities were actually the ones, in control. exactly. that's a switch. the minority was like actually the majority too. yeah. cuz they had all the power. i agree with some things, but i ain't agreeing with everything. so there's probably been most revolutionary because, it caused people to_ i don't think_ you were saying how it was all  it is (xx) (really is) well they started you know forming trade unions and everything so  back in the day    i think that's probably why it's (xx) the most revolutionary part. is that, with all the, all these people being oppressed and that's what caused the revolution (to take place.) because the bourgeoisie was oppressing all the, laborers. right.  and since they were the majority i mean it's always easier to, for the majority to take over       i mean that's what minimum wage is. that means i (could) pay you less if i could but it'd be illegal. yeah, okay i definitely gotta start taking notes after this book it's just that, he he goes from, one thing to another, like he like, some of his thoughts don't coincide, to me. he just, you know he just believe everybody should  we're two different groups. we're a group and they're a group.  oh um, the, bourgeoisie changed family structures and the relevance of like, certain skills like before you know it was good to be a farmer and now it was good like, they would work the machines, um, it brought the concept of modern industry and a world market um more to the forefront, it put a price tag on everything, and it, sort of would change the way people looked at class structure it was now, how much money you had and not who, what your title was or who you were related to or something. okay. okay. anything, okay. yeah. that was all, part of what, what was in the Manifesto. let's collect the list and then talk about it so that was that was that was a great start. how about you folks right here? um, what the bourgeoisie did, was, they opened a path for future revolution. by breaking down the former institutions that were held up by things like divine right, which, unless you don't believe it you can't really say much against. their institutions were founded on, reason and ability. um and, Marx points out that those are the tools that the proletariat are gonna use to break down, um the bourgeoisie whole and. that's what he sees as the path of revolution. unlike previous institutions, they create, a path where they_ we are from. they they create a path?    okay that's, that's another great point. so it, basically creates its own gravediggers right (xx) okay. um... from a quote wha- what's that, quote from? was that from the Manifesto? yeah mhm very good so, so it strips away the illusions of, of feudal society. (like absolutely) um okay any- anything else now? sort of let's have it as a free-for-all... why else is the bourgeoisie, revolutionary? yeah? he said that uh, it created even further social distance between, like the worker and the people with the money, and that's oftentimes what the cause of war is, it's dissatisfaction with one class group (with) another. but the whole fact of capitalism is that basically who has the money is who makes the decisions. so now you have this really wide gap between groups. okay. mhm okay. okay that's very good. yeah. split society up into, into these two big chunks of people. yeah? he also points out um, quoting him okay okay. so compared to previous, right.  could you raise that up a little? oh yeah.  better... how to treat money  to make more money. right but why can't you just say sit still, and, continue making money (xx) cuz somebody else,  right. right. you gotta get on top of capitalism, not let you become like, capitalized by your own system, okay. you hafta keep up with the Joneses. right. right. i mean in the case of the big companies with the  you buy up all_ everybody else's companies, and make them yours that way you own everything. right. that's sort of the tendency isn't it? um... so yeah. if you don't do something better someone else will. and then they'll, they'll capture the market. um now this is unlike_ at least Marx claims this is unlike the feudal ruling classes who really didn't have to deal with, much of this stuff. for example the way that agriculture was done, remained pretty much the same for hundreds of years, though there were inventions like the plow and so on. but for the most part, kind of remained static, until the bourgeoisie came on the scene. so again, uh the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly innovating. i have a question in the, proletarian version of this section, (in here) it says um that the movement of the proletarians was the only majority, revolution but what about the Third Estate? i'm confused. oh okay good question um... the, he's he's really talking about, by by the ti- he wrote the Communist Manifesto in eighteen forty-eight. and, the French Revolution, happened in seventeen eighty-nine. and so by the time he's writing, he's assuming that, the Third Estate which, which was the bourgeoisie, has won. and has consolidated its, its rule. and, so now he's, he's talking about, the proletariat rather than, than those guys... i don't know y- you still look puzzled...   oh okay. um yeah it was a majority revolution in that it represented most of the people in France, compared to the f- the First and Second Estates. but within the Third Estate it's actually, the upper middle class that really ultimately comes, to the top. uh of France and then more or less over Europe over a period of time. um and becomes the new ruling class. and so Marx chooses to call it the bourgeoisie. and so now when he's talking about, the proletariat being the movement of the great majority, he's actually talking about, basically anyone... i saw another, at least another hand, huh? uh, i kinda think of the bouja-  well that's a great question and that's the kind of thing if, you want to deal with it, for you know f- f- for the part where you really tackle what this stuff means today. that's absolutely the kind of thing to look at. maybe i should bring in some numbers about this um, uh if you look at the wealth, wealth holdings in the U-S um it's pretty narrowly_ the the actual ownership of the means of production, is very narrowly concentrated. it's about, a couple of percent of the population maybe less like you said. um, so certainly, what, Marx would take that to mean is that, the rest rest of the folks are_ even if as you say_ even if they're fairly well off, in terms of standard of living, so long as you exist by having to sell your your labor power as a commodity so long as that's the condition of your existence, you belong in the proletariat even if you make, seventeen, (twenty) thousand i just have a question so the, bourgeoisie was just mainly the people that owned the major factories. or the major, yeah yeah yes. yes. that's the strict Marx Marxist_ let me just say one more, yeah um, i'm just wondering how selling one's, labor is so different from the way, it had been in the past? i mean in the past you were using your labor to produce food and then you were giving the food away  okay. if you'll permit us to defer that question to the third week which is when we will look at that in great detail, but that's exactly, it's a version of Mark's question here but phrased a little more technically and we'll get to that, then. (i actually had my hand up) i had  no, i was gonna say, you saying, how do you pur- purchase you  ah i mean, if i understood right the question he was like how do you you know capital- capitalize on somebo- purchasing somebody else's labor, well is that the question? was that was that your question? how you capitalize on somebody else's labor?   well but Marx, seems to talk of it like it's such a bad, such a horrible thing to be, used  okay. yeah you guys are getting at slightly different aspects of, of the question. but yeah there's the issue of, having a certain kind of labor power to be sold, and then having that become obsolete. because, of a change. or (needing) some other (kind.) i mean there's this other issue of_ Marx claims that, sort of a little_ it's closer to um uh what what Tina was just saying, is that the fact that you can, sell your labor power, uh means in a sense that you're free. uh to... i mean you can sell it to anyone. in in principle, you can sell it to anyone. um, whereas if you're a serf, you're really confined to that piece of land and, you get, you get what you, a portion of of your work. back. but yeah you don't get all this, this other stuff. i mean this is all in, in principle. um, but that's that's one, one piece of it. and you will see more from (the reading.) (xx) a couple of weeks. but it's a great, great (xx) okay. see you all, in a couple of days.  you see what i'm saying. like you know Kevin Garnett you see, that's, you know that's somebody gonna capitalize on his skills you know hundred seventy-seven million dollars, (xx) (Philadelphia) that's fucking ridiculous. see, my whole question is like i think that Michael Jordan is the greatest person who just shows capitalism, okay for seven years they used (xx) (over) hundred million or however much money that they make. he cries for thirty million and (ustest) people wanna know why does he want thirty million? isn't he happy with what he got? but that's the same thing we argue about at a smaller level. because he he gets paid to perform (there.) like he's giving you he's giving you a bet- like, a better show. and not even that. if you wanna make, if this a hundred if this is a hundred a hundred dollars, and i'm doing all the work and all you're doing is boosting me up, i at least want one of them dollars. i at least want ten of them dollars. (now) i'm taking that you (wanna) have a (ninety.) not in_ even though you put those rules where i have to be here at a certain time. i have to come in a certain time i i wan- you own me. you own me even though i'm doing all this i'm still the worker making thirty million or a hundred twenty-seven. if you don't come to that game, you can get put out of the league just like everybody else they got all rules for everybody who don't wanna act it yeah but some people who don't even get that you know get put out you know he could miss like two or three games, it's like no. he got a contract. that's what the contract's   nope.   yeah. i'm struggling making it at U-of-M to (save) for what? so i can go out here and work for these people, ten fifteen hours a day? but it's better than being at home selling drugs or or being in jail somewhere. ah see some people got their hedonistic way like hey i'm living for today    (xx) i mean i wasn't just trying to ask them a question in a way that like if we were saying anything we just try and repeat that because as they said maybe we're headed on down because technological advances we have computers whereas before you know, the swis- (you know it) was like, for example switchboard operator, yeah right.     oh no that's okay.  that's that that that that's, the answer to that is just like based on like we, this_ as they said specialization. if you specialize in something like you know, yeah yeah yeah oh this thing_ oh I thought it came off  um 	1
LEL500JU034.json	good afternoon. good afternoon. uh, it's not always the case but today's music actually was related to the lecture the first song was called Do the Evolution, and the second was Strong Enough to be My Man which, will really be more, as far as we're gonna get more like um, Thursday's lecture, but i hope to be able to find another content related theme, music by Thursday too. i actually have no announcements today, although someone else has an announcement about recording the lecture. before i, do that do you have any questions? okay, so here's an announcement about recording. i always wanted to be part of a corpus. um, okay. what we're gonna do, in, today's lecture, is we're basically done with history, we're done with methods, and we're going on to biopsychology. so we're gonna talk about, biopsychology from a couple of different perspectives, and before i talk about_ we're gonna talk about sorta, biopsychology as it relates to sort of our evolutionary heritage, (but) we're also gonna talk about biopsychology as it relates to the immediate, moment, um, i- i've got names for those kind of causes here in a minute but, uh before i do that i just wanna, sorta make a plea, one of the things that, that i find sort of frustrating or mystifying or, i don't know exactly how to put it but, at the end of the course lots of times students come up to me and they say you know that psychology stuff i really liked it, but i didn't understand why there was all that biology in there. i don't understand what the biology has to do with the psychology and so, i'm gonna make this point a couple of times in the biopsych lectures but i just wanna try to make it, here one time, uh with feelings, which is that, i mean at some level the reason why i find it a frustrating thing is i sorta don't know how to respond to it because while, biology is not what people often think of in psychology when they think about clinical psychology for example, it is the case, that every single thought, emotion, memory, any psychological experience you've had, conscious, unconscious, it doesn't matter what it is, it has a biological component to it. you do not think without biology. you do not experience an emotion, without changes in your biological make-up. those things are mediated at some level by biology. so it's sort of like, i mean in some ways it's sorta like, i_ i- i- it would be sorta like saying, you know, i took a course on driving and i didn't understand they kept talking about the car all the time. that didn't make any sense to me. in some ways that's it i think sometimes it's hard to see as we get into how neurons act, and what evolutionary theory says and what does it have to do with biology_ with psychology, it's easy to lose the connection. but the connection is, the proposition is simply that, our biology, whether we're talking about our evolutionary heritage, or whether we're talking about immediate changes, in uh our biological make-up, influence our behavior and psychological experience. you cannot have a psychological experience, without having the biol- biological component going along with it. again, you know, at the at the extreme, no brain no central nervous system no thought no psychological experience nothing, right? so, what we're gonna do over the next couple weeks, is try to look at, different biological takes, on uh, on uh, behavior. and we're gonna begin by talking about evolution, and behavior, uh and that's what today's lecture is gonna be about entirely, and much of Thursday will be about evolution and behavior too. before_ in_ and in evolution and behavior, essentially what we're asking is, does our evolutionary heritage, does the generations and generations and generations that we've been in an environment, influence, our uh our current behavior. and, one of the things i'm gonna try to do in the lecture, is to try to mark out for you, what is and isn't controversial, among psychologists about the proposition that evolution shapes behavior. so we're gonna spend much of today talking about Darwin, and Darwin's Theory of Evolution so that, uh, w- i make sure that we all, sort of understand what Darwin's Theory of Evolution was about, and then try to apply it to, human behavior. parts of that account are extremely controversial in psychology, and parts of it aren't. and i'm gonna try to help you, see, which is and isn't controversial. and uh, and we'll see that as we go on. uh... the other thing to make as sort of a, a preamble to this also is, is that evolutionary theory, is really, i mean we're gonna be, there's sorta two things that i wanna talk about there're two questions as i talk about in evolutionary theory, that i think you wanna think about as we go through the lecture. the first is is it in fact possible to identify, behavioral candidates for making an evolutionary account? can you find some behaviors that look like maybe evolution shaped them? do you have to make the argument that all behaviors are shaped by evolution? so the first most of what today is going to be about is, can you find some behaviors that it looks like we can make an evolutionary argument about? what would you want to look for in a behavior that would be consistent with an evolutionary argument? the second thing is, if you make an evolutionary argument, or any biological argument, how should you interpret the meaning of that? so evolution for example is really a theory, about how environments shape behaviors over millennia. so at some level you can talk about it as being a biological cause, it's our genetics, it's our evolutionary heritage. it's also possible to talk about it as being an environmental cause, one of the thgings that you're gonna see is evolution is very much a theory about the environment. but, i- no matter what if you accept the biological explanation whether it's evolutionary or whether it has something to do with current brain structure and function, how should you interpret it to say that some thi- some behavior is caused by our biology? so for example if i made this argument that said that, there's lots of good evidence that says you know most of us like sweets, most of us like fats now we don't like to say boy i love to eat a big tub of fat but we all like butter on our bread, right? and the reason why we like butter on our bread is cuz it got high fat content. one of the argument_ the reason why we like really good, premium ice creams, is because they have high fat content, that's the main thing that separates a premium ice cream from your run of the mill ice cream. so, um you could make this evolutionary account that said, gee, maybe the reason why we like we tend to universally like sweets and fats, is because of our evolutionary heritage. maybe an_ a taste for those substances, was adapted in our past. maybe we've evolved a preference. for sweet and fat. now does that mean that when you're walking down the street and you walk by the donut place, and you smell the cinnamon rolls, wafting out, which are high both in sugar and fat, you say, i gotta have one. it's not my fault it's my evolutionary heritage i have no choice in this, i'm a highly evolved human being and that's what i've evolved to do is gonna be eat the donut right? so, we wanna sorta try to talk about what the me- what it means to make a biological evolutionary argument. now in talking about biological approaches to behavior, i really do want to make a distinction and the lectures are organized around the basic distinction between two kinds of causes. one kind of cause the cause that people typically think about, when they're talking about biological causes is what we could call the proximal cause. the proximal cause just means the close cause. the immediate cause, same_ it shares the same root as w- words like approximate. it's close, nearby. so in terms of biopsychology when you're looking at proximal causes, you're looking at how current changes in physiology or structure, change behavior. how they're associated with it. so, if you wanna know what happens when people experience love, at the neurochemical level, you're looking for a proximal cause of behavior. um and it is clearly the case that, things like, brain structure and neural functioning, affect psychological experience. if you're in an automobile accident, and have damage to the frontal lobes, it's absolutely gonna change your behavior. if you have, uh damage to the hypothalamus, your ability to regulate hunger and thirst is gonna go out the door. those brain structures, neurotransmitters how neurons fire if you lose for example a neuron, if you lose the myelin sheathing that uh, insulates the neurons s- insulates some of the neurons, which is what happens in n- multiple sclerosis, you will absolutely see behavioral changes. there is a dynamic relationship between the current biological state of the organism, and its behavior. and that's what most of biopsychology looks at. but you can look at the biological influence on behavior in another way, you can look for distal causes, same root as the word distant far away causes. so is there anything not in the immediate moment that shape_ about our immediate biology that shapes behavior, but is there something about our biological heritage that shapes behavior? um is the be- and one way to think about it is is the behavior of our ancestors, currently_ or the behavioral choices that they made, continued to influence our current behavioral choices. uh, in a biopsych- in biopsychology if you're looking for, distal causes, you're essentially looking for evolutionary-based explanations. okay? and again that's what we're gonna try to do today, is to look, at evolutionary explanations of behavior. uh, as we look at them, uh, again, keep in mind that what you wanna know_ what you wanna try to ask yourself are these two questions, are there some kinds of behaviors that are maybe more amenable, more obviously open to an evolutionary account than other behaviors. and two, even if you find an evolutionary explanation for a behavior, what should you make of it? to what extent_ how_ what kind of explanation has that provided for the behavior that you observe? questions? (xx) okay well what i want to do then is to start talking about evolutionary theory, and then we're gonna move into psychology. so if you wanna talk about evolutionary theory you have to start with Charles Darwin. not because Darwin was the first evolutionary theorist. he was not. um there were lots of evolutionary theorists, clanking around at the time of Darwin. what Darwin did was got it right, um and i'll try to tell you where he differed from other other evolutionary theorists, as we go along. a few, trivial sort of facts about Darwin, he was born in eighteen-oh-nine, you don't really need to know that, it's just a trivial fact he was born in eighteen-oh-nine in England, um to a wealthy family, uh his mother who died when he was eight, was actually the daughter of the founder of Wedgewood China Company, so, just a little trivia. um, incredibly affluent family, uh Darwin set off to college, and uh wanted_ initially his plan was to become a a medical physician. uh but he didn't stick with that very long. it's not clear whether his decision not to go into medicine was because the lectures were just deadly dull, uh and he just couldn't find any intellectual interest in it in the time, or if it was really an aversion to seeing and performing surgeries surgeries at that time were done without anesthesia. that's a pretty gruesome thing to be involved with, um and so he bailed, uh early on, from his plan to be a physician. he, got his B-A, and uh set out on a journey, uh his first job was an unpaid job. he spent five years as a ship's naturalist, on the H-M-S Beagle. uh again it was an unpaid job what a ship's naturalist was_ did was, uh on ships of the Crown on British ships, the ship's naturalist, would travel around, and and their jobs, were to ex- to examine and write about, the animals and plant life the flora and fauna that they encountered, on the travel, and the H-M-S Beagle was on a round-the-world journey (again it) it took five years. and uh, what Darwin did was he would go do_ collect samples, he would write about his observations, when Darwin came back after five years, he basically never left England again. in fact he basically never really left, um d- his immediate town he suffered for most of his life, from sort of a chronic illness probably contracted, while he was travelling in the tropics on the H-M-S Beagle, but he he didn't, venture forward very much and he had this enormous impact, and he never left England. uh he did continue to collect data for the rest of his life but the way would collect data was, uh he would, write to colleagues, scientists around the world and so for example when we get to the emotion part, he'd ask them, what do people look like when they express happiness in your culture? you know, or here's a drawing show it to some people and tell me, what they think this emotion is. so he would do it all by correspondence. uh he lived to be, uh quite old for the day he lived i think until he was seventy-two. he died in eighteen eighty-two, and and he his uh, another piece of trivia, his uh grave, is uh next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton, which in some ways is highly appropriate, because, now, Isaac Newton's impact on physical science, is of the same magnitude as Darwin_ i guess you'd normally say it the other way, cuz people always assume Newton's the big guy. Darwin's impact, on biological sciences, is easily as big, as Newton's impact on the physical sciences. um, Darwin's theory of evolution as we're gonna, um, as we're gonna see, in a, in a minute, uh really found_ forms the foundation, of biological sciences today, and uh one of the things that i just wanna say right off the bat is, um bi- evolution is one of those things that, outside of, scientific circles there's still lots of discussion about whether evolution is true or not. now n- i wanna tell you that within scientific circles which is not to say that it's not possible that scientists are wrong, but, within scientific circles Darwin's theory of evolution is not controversial. there are controversies about specific parts, of evolutionary theory, but the idea that organisms evolve, that they adapt to their environments and that it leads to some of these adaptations, are passed on to future generations, is not a_ is not controversial in science you can only find a handful of scientists, in the world right now who would, who uh uh, who would disagree with that i think. um, uh so although evolution is controversial sometimes in, our culture, it's pretty much an assumed truth, within within science. and it's an assumed truth within psychology, all_ what what_ where psychologists start to break down, is in whether or not you can account for, um not just physical changes evolving, but whether or not you can see behavioral changes and i'll try to make that clear as we go along. but, his impact on the biological sciences was enormous. uh and so let me tell you a little bit about the story of what happened so he's travelling around on the Beagle which is when hi- the, origins of his theory of evolution really started happening. he spends five years travelling around and one of the things that he notices over and over again, is that he sees variations, of species in different environments. in particular if you think about the gal- if you go to the Galapagos Islands, one of the things that he was struck by was that there were at least eighteen different versions, of the same species of finch. finch is a little bird right? and, all of these different versions were clearly members of the same mainland's finch, that he observed, but as he travelled around the Galapagos he noticed that, on different environments in different islands, the finches were subtly different. so for example on one island he would find that the finches look just like all the other finches except that their beak, is really short and really thick, really tough. he'd go to another island and discover that the finches looked just alike except that their beaks, are long fragile slender things. and he notices, that as he looks at, their diets what they eat in the different uh environments he notices that on the island where the finches have the short tough beaks, their diet consists primarily of hard, nuts. and on the r- island where they have the long thin beaks their diet consists primarily of insects that bore into, the bark of trees. so what Darwin says is ah, these organisms are adapting to their environments. okay? they're changing anatomically, in ways that fit the environment. i mean think about it how nice it is if you're on an island where your main diet is gonna be these, hard to crack nuts, it's gonna be great to have a beak that's really tough. on the other hand if you're on an island where your primary diet is gonna be these little insects that bore in isn't it great, that you have this long thin beak, um, to uh get in to those insects. so what he noticed was that, organisms adapt to their environments. and that's evolution. Darwin's not the only one who, notices that. lots of competing theorists are noticing the same thing, that in_ that organisms seem to, match with, adapt to their environments. what Darwin does that's different, from the other theories of evolution, is propose that the mechanism by which that adaptation occurs, and the mechanism that he proposes is natural selection. sadness. 	1
DIS115JU087.json	our, class today. um one is Diane she's a G-S-I, um, so she's just observing. and um, i'm sorry i don't know your name. Janine. Janine she's, um, gonna tell you a little bit more about what she's doing that's why we have a microphone, just so you all know, what's going on and, consent to it. okay. alright. so i hope that's not gonna make you all um, self-conscious, um, cuz we won't have a very good class if you are, but um... today i wanted to talk about um, we'll, partially talk about the lectures that we had this week, which were about, political systems and, i wanted to start off, doing that by talking about, power and social organization social control. maybe you wanna talk to her after just to make sure, um that you know what's going on with that. okay. well when you're younger you do. i think though that's, that's a good point, actually. so let's let's, keep that in mind. and sometimes that when you're older you still do like if you're a, if you're a criminal. sure. i mean, i i mean, social control is obviously, not perfect. so um   um, okay so what does that, what does that tell us already, if if young people, are more likely to steal things than, than o- um, older people? yeah. either that they're, more rebellious, or maybe, or just that they're not as accustomed to, society's norms yet. yeah that's, yeah, i mean, yeah rebellious, or, or not we, we could call it socialized. which basically just means they're not accustomed to society's norms yet. yeah. or they're just too young to understand the uh, consequences of, stealing oh that's yeah, and this is important um, the consequences... somebody else have something they wanted to say? there also like, isn't like as many consequences for them. yeah, that's true, i mean, um why do you think that there are not as many consequences? i mean why do, why do um, why does society_ why is our society set up so there won't be as many consequences? cuz they aren't gonna like, throw like a six-year-old in jail for like stealing something or like make him pay a big fine (he'll) probably just turn- return it  i mean i think we could talk about like the six year old boy with like the gun obviously, you know uh yeah.  to like, to kids the only consequence like of stealing is getting, what they're stealing. like there's no like punishment and for the kid like, shooting that girl to him he was like, repaying her for hitting him cuz i think that was what the thing was, like that was the only consequence he didn't think he was gonna kill her i mean he doesn't, he just thinks he's gonna pay her back like, he right he, he only like understood death by how the movie portrayed it. like big deal like, another one, like in T- in T-two like, thousands of people die. you know to him so why is it, why is it that, young children don't understand, say, about, what it means to kill somebody? and it's not a difficult, question really i'm just trying to get you to,  sorry? so basically you could say that um, basically s- alright if young people are not socialized, and they're protected, they're not yet socialized they're protected. um, the, period of of youth is one, i mean, i'm sort of drawing on your comments and sort of, adding to them but, the period of, of youth is one where, where people get socialized where people get, taught. um, what, they need to know in order to live in society say. and they're protected, so that they don't, learn, everything too fast. is that, i mean is that one of the values, of our society? i know you probably heard that before, um, so i mean what is it that they're being taught? i mean for one thing, they're being taught, well i'll move this over they're being taught consequences right? cuz you said they didn't know, what the consequences are. um, what else, yeah. they don't like they don't know the difference between right and wrong, for like a certain, amount of time and so if you teach 'em everything, if you teach 'em how to like, use a gun then they don't know, if it's right or wrong to use the gun.  yeah so they're being taught morals. did you have something to say? that's, what i was gonna say. what else? anything else that they're being, taught? yeah. well it's like, and a lot of times when you see movies and kids are like, exposed to just ignore it. when kids are exposed to some, (like) murders later on in life they have problems. you know what i mean if they're exposed to something too early, and later on they have problems like being abused, you know later on they have problems it's like you know like, yeah that's true or- yeah or- right so i guess that falls under the, under the category of, of we protect them from learning things too, quickly. um, is there, is there a connection? between, between consequences and morals? i think, they use the consequences to teach morals. yeah, that's a good, that's a good one. just like sitting in a corner. punishment. punishment. yeah, so there's, there's um punishment. i don't think it's really a difference i think that, in bands tribes and chiefdoms, they had to do that, to get people to follow 'em. and, support 'em. but if they could've, like just kept it all to themselves they would've. maybe so. i mean i'm not saying that's not true but it was a, it's a standard of that society right? yeah. i think all morals are created. like if you look at World War Two, and, you know murder wasn't bad anymore because you were, as long as you can like, justify your actions, you can create any moral. yeah that's an interesting, that's an interesting, point of view. yeah. i was gonna say that uh, i think, i think morals are all the same, but i think uh, different cultures, rank, the importance of dif- different morals accordingly. uh, just, like an example is, if you compare, Eastern thought, with Western thought, over any any range of topic it's like, Eastern thought is very, group oriented you know like, you know you, you acquiesce to the to the person a- above you or you know someone like, like someone that you, that you should hold more respect for, and Western thought's very like individualistic and you know personal rights and all that stuff so. i d- i th- i think morals are, basically the same from culture to culture. but it would depend on the way they rank the importance of each one. yeah that's a really interesting, that's a really interesting way to look at it. i like that. i mean yeah basically he said that um, in some way you can have both you can say that, that there are, morals which are universal, but, culture still plays a big role, in determining, um, which morals take precedence. and um, that's actually something there's a um, a really famous, philosopher who, who wrote something very, very similar, to that so, just in case you're interested, um, Alasdair MacIntyre. i don't know jus- just to let you know. but yeah he's he's he's, um a really well-respected philosopher who said something very similar. yeah. um, as for like whether or not there are absolute morals, i definitely think that there're, are neces- whether or not they're universal morals is, i don't think ever gonna be, known or whe- whether or not they're socially constructed or whatnot, but definitely i think like something as extreme as a child killing someone, um, some are more, like are more obvious than others. and haven't been known to like, work, like certain actions. yeah, that's yeah that's a good point. i don't think there's any universal morals. um you look back in time, before like monotheistic religion, and they would sacrifice people, to God. as long as you believe like, you have that faith that, i don't know how to put in words really but, give me a minute i'll come back to it but, so what does that mean to justify it? like how how do we justify? like you're sacrificing the person for God for like a higher (meaning.) if it's culturally justified. yeah i think yeah that's yeah i think there's a lotta truth to that point too. yeah, did you wanna say, i'm sorry no, never mind. i got your point. it's the second time that happened to you today. i think that like has a lot to do with like looking at other cultures from like, your own culture like, like, we can look at 'em and say like, that it's a bad thing it's not moral for our like, but then they look at and it is moral so, so like it's hard to say like, you can't, you can't like, um, look at other cultures like and, whatever say if they're right or wrong then it's like hard to say. yeah i mean that's, yeah that's basically, that's like, cultural relativism which we were talking about a couple weeks ago. definitely becomes important. yeah. and not to stereotype but like, some uh Gypsy tribes it's uh, like to steal is how they survive. you know like moving from one place to another and by stealing that's how they get by. it's not amoral to them, it's uh- or immoral to them.   um, about the Gypsy thing but, like, if, it's justified to them but they, pay consequences, if they're in our society because that's wrong in our society. right but not, but not within their own. so, so that_ i mean that's a interesting point though because, um we were talking about consequences and um, i mean there could be cases where consequences and morals are not, related. so, um, and this is something also to think about. with this, with this typology actually, because um, this is something that i wanted to get to, um in class today, um i mean we talk about all these different types of, governments right? but um, a- at the bottom line in in the year two thousand, are there, are there really any band, tribe or chiefdom governments? in the like the Amazon they still are, a little bit sorry? like in the Amazon where they, really have no contact they've   it's kind of like the situation in Waco. because they thought they were living by, they were living by their own rules and stuff in another cultu- you know in another yeah yeah and that's a really good point and i mean that's, i mean in some cases i mean they d- they di- they weren't successful, and maybe we're glad of that, or- i mean not that they were treated fairly of course but, maybe we're glad that they didn't um, you know, weren't able to secede and form their own country or whatever but, i mean that, that can be something that ends up, having consequences, for state governments as a whole, if if s- groups, form that have their own, values, they can end up challenging and changing, the way that the larger society is structured so that's, that's another, another thing to think about, with the whole issue of power and, and social control. um, d- now, we're talking about morals i think morals are really central to this but, there's other things, there're other, types of control, besides, morals that are exerted on us i think. um, for example, let's say um, coming to class, right? um, it's not immoral, to cut class well maybe it- i mean you could ma- maybe someone could make an argument like, i don't know your parents paid all this money and, you made a promise to them to go to class and so it's immoral to cut class but, um, let's say uh, let's say for the sake of argument you know you paid your own, tuition, it's your own choice, um, but you're still here, you came to class, um ho- hopefully part of the reason is because you like coming to class and you're learning something and you're, you know. but um, in some cases maybe not in this class but in some class that you've taken you probably didn't, really like it or really get that much out of it but you still, went to class anyway. um, not because it was immoral not to go but, but why? the grade. i mean yeah, i mean this, still gets back to consequences definitely, um social consequences. um, and that's one reason. maybe you have like higher aspirations like on a- like if you have a different, if you have like a, some kind of goal later in life that you wanna achieve, then you can't really achieve that by going camping yeah, i mean that's, that's an important, i mean that's related to consequences but it's, it's separate... i mean, yeah definitely goals, definitely goals are important. and that's wh- for a lot of people that's that's the reason why they do, go to school. what if you um, i mean there must be someone like this, in the class, um like, me, when i was, um your age. what if you really don't know what you wanna do, when you graduate from college? i mean chances are probably that um, going to college is gonna help you with whatever you, end up deciding to do, but if you really don't know what you're gonna do how do you know, that um, going to college is a good thing? i mean this, i mean what is it, yeah. because you've seen it work for other people,  that's true, yeah and that's, i mean that's um, that's important, that's an important part of socialization is, is um imitation. and you sort of have to trust that, things will go the same way for you that they go, for other people. yeah. it's also not exactly a bad thing to learn, new information i mean even if that, even if, a college education isn't gonna be exactly, what you're gonna, if it's not gonna take you where you wanna be it's not exactly a bad thing to, learn, new stuff. yeah, that's true, um, definitely. um you have to experience it all, and then you get to, to decide after that. i mean that's definitely, that's definitely, that's definitely um, that's definitely, true, to s- i mean with- within some boundaries right though. yeah. i think it's also too to some extent social, social conditions social norms like, when you're talking about something as broad as college you know. i- in our, in our society it's, it's the thing that you should do, you know you should go to college if you were in high school and you were smart. like if you meet someone and you know, they were really smart in high school and then they said yeah i just didn't wanna go to college, most of us would think, you know what's, what's wrong with this person? and you know in other societies it's like, to not go to, you know after you graduate from high school it's (natural) for them just to go into the workplace and they don't think twice about, going to college so i think it's also, social, social norms and that kind of thing. it, it can't really ap- it doesn't really apply to, something specific as going to class, going, like skipping class. but when you're talking about going to college i think it does. yeah i think that's um, i think that's a really good point, um, and let's yeah i mean that's, probably a point that's, more related to um anthropology. um, but i, i mean this isn't seeming like to, um too much information to you all but i guess what i'm trying to get at, by getting you to give me all these, different answers is how um, well first of all social life is really complex. and there are a- there are social norms but then there're also other factors that help people to choose, between different social norms, and um, and even factors that influence people to, to go outside of social norms. but the social norms are still exist and they still, have, some kind of, interaction with these other factors so, by throwing all of these out i, i hope that you're, starting to think about how these things might fit together. um, how di- how do social norms, relate to the goals? i mean this is, really just building on what you said but, but um, i mean, when we set goals, how do we decide what our goals, should be? i mean, do you think for example that if someone didn't go to college it means they're gonna be, miserable for the rest of their life? and their life is worthless? i mean probably, not. i hope, you don't think that. i mean it just depends what makes you happy. like if i was, George Bush's, son like the first one? i probably wouldn't've even gone to school. you know i would've had all the money, i wouldn't've wanted, wanted to be a politician. i would've been happy you know?  it makes 'em happy. why does it make them happy? gives their lives, gives their life like self-worth, i don't know. well you need something to do. you go crazy when you like stagnate and have nothing to do. i think that's, that's i mean there's definitely um, there's definitely, some truth to this, i mean, i'm not saying you're wrong, but on the other hand think about um, did you ever read, um any novels by Jane Austin say or, see any of the movies? like what? it like maybe it was a little more socially accepted, in that time period. it seems now, everybody, if you're not doing something, then people really question why you're not doing anything since everybody's so busy and there's  even doing that gives you something to do it's just in a different context. it's jus- people need like, some sense of accomplishment, like in their lives to know that they're, doing something i mean, o- obviously it'd be great if it's always you know for a worthy cause but, even just playing the piano, can give yourself some sa- self-satis- you know -faction that you can, maybe, you know, show it to other people or, you know, bring it to other areas. i mean i think that's true that people, i mean they are always doing something, definitely, and that's an important point. but i mean i just wanna emphasize that that we, we've, gotten back again to the um, to the social norms. i mean in our society there's a, a norm that says, people should be doing something all the time. um, what's wrong with you if you're not doing something? um, in that society, well people still i mean it wasn't, you know they didn't, sit in a chair and stare at the wall all day but, but um there was a different definition of what it means to have a sense of accomplishment or what it means, to do something. so um, that's, that's another way that um, that culture sort of determines... in a way, or helps to determine i should say. what, what we do. so i mean... why do we, why do we have these, beliefs in social norms? i mean what do you think? how did we get this idea that we should be doing something all the time? i think a lot of it gets relayed through like your parents. like i know my parents have a strong push for education, it always comes first. whereas like, in school you could always see like the people whose parents didn't push as hard and, then i- i- like it's really, up to the child and, they don't care so much. but then there's the people whose parents don't care and then they care a lot. definitely. i mean i think it definitely has, a lot to do with, with your parents. um, i mean some things, you know are really different, for different parents i- different parents emphasize different, kind of goals and some things, um that maybe all parents within, a certain society, all, share so that's, that's really important yeah. i think a lot of it also has to uh do with what you choose to sort of like latch onto like whether it's your parents or what you see on T-V and it's sort of all, um, developed as you get older, and, like sometimes for people it's like gangs they see you know? and th- you know that's you sorta start to, form, those things. yeah yeah and i mean that's, that's a really important, way of putting it too that, that um, within, the category that you could call social norms there's all these different, one second, there's all these different choices that, that people could make, they can choose to follow their parents they can choose to follow T-V which is still, setting up another, kind of norm in a way. because when you watch T-V. i mean think about this next time that you watch T-V cuz, cuz i think you'll um, you'll notice, um, a lot of shows have some kind of moral lesson or some kind of, um, some kind of values that they're promoting either, you know crime is bad or, um, family harmony is good or, um something about, love and relationships or there's all different of societal norms that you could see, really explicitly in T-V programs. and then there's also the peers. which our, which our society, um, you know sometimes, perhaps, if it's if it's gangs maybe it's not the most um, healthy or productive, way to, um, kind of society part of our society, you could argue. but, still, um, peers and kind of peer pressure, um is a kind of social norm. and i mean especially in a, in a really big society like ours in a in a, state society, um, there are different, there are different, factors and different choices, that um, you know in a band maybe there wouldn't be quite as many, um, but there're different, influences, that can, come in. did you have something to say? uh i was gonna say that, you know social norm is such a broad category you know it covers, shaking hands, you know as well as like, i don't know helping helping an old lady across the street or something but, i think in uh, in industrialized, in industrialized nations, the state plays a really large part in, monitoring or, at least tweaking social norms to their, you know to their preference so that it's, it, it all, it all plays together to, help the state function, most effectively. yeah i mean that's, that's a really interesting point. and a lot of people, a lot of people do say that that the state, um i mean the state, definitely has an interest right? in in um, in keeping, society ordered. um in making, sure that, people fill different tasks, in society you know if no one, um wanted to work at McDonald's then, no one could ever eat there for example. um so, the state, definitely has it- has an interest in, promoting certain, kinds of norms. but how does, i mean, and this is a really, you know it's kind of almost a philosophical question so, i don't expect you all to be able to answer it, right now but um, how does, how do these norms get from, the state or from, some body of government, to, the people? how does, how does, the state control people? i mean it's, yeah. i mean just in, every every connection that the state has with, you know in in terms of politicians' speeches, in their censorship of the media, um, you know in in their dealings with, with uh, with religious leaders and, and i mean there's so many, there's so much literature on you know how, religion is just it's, i forget the, what the quote is but it's uh, it's a, it's a, it's a pill for the p- pill for the people  religion is the uh  yeah i was just gonna say, i mean i- it's, all you have to do is just look at the Republican party, and you can see very well that religion and state are definitely not separated, you know like, there's such a, huge co- Christian coalition and, that's true  yeah well that's true i mean, religious people are making the, laws you know they're gonna follow their convictions they, would be, unethical not to follow their convictions. um that's, that's certainly true. um, yeah it's it's i mean, if if, we're talking about morals, um, i mean, that has to be, always, connected to religion. definitely. um i wa- i definitely think though that, um i'm not, i don't know like how far we've come but, a lotta people have this notion that it should either happen overnight, or that it should never happen and, rather than believing that it can happen gradually. and something like church and state, i mean as connected as they still might be, i mean not necessarily as much and, you know, again when people ha- think that it should just happen like that, you know, usually the consequences, are negative. and, you know  well my, my understanding of the constitution, it says separation of ch- church from the state but, it doesn't mean that, the religion can't, have a say in the state because the whole meaning of that was that the state, couldn't overtake religion, like they were doing in Great Britain. so there's no way that you can sit there and say, you know you can't bring your religious beliefs into politics because, it's a part of your everyday life and then that'd be, crossing your constitutional right of freedom of religion so, i think if, a candidate wants to tell, their religious belief i say go for it i mean, but i i totally disagree with the whole s- m- the state and the religion, can't be intermixed because, the whole purpose of that was that the state couldn't tell people, about their religious beliefs  um, you got my, i got your email back so, wha- what was that all about? wha- i'm sorry what? it was about like, that you didn't have my final exam, oh yeah no i'm sorry about that yeah. i just, i was, um, i was confused i think it was, that's okay (somebody else) yeah. but i found it so it's no problem. okay good. i have a question really quick i just wanna know if this is like a (fault) like i was having problems with like costs of like a foraging society uhuh yeah and like, the book doesn't really touch on it all that much like it talks about (farming society) so like i said like a cost, was that they can't support all the people and they can be pushed out, of like they talked about it in, like (Schultz and Nower) talked about it, is that like one human lifetime something is past that oh right. they didn't have it yeah that's a good, that's a good point. okay, okay i just wanted to make sure. alright cool. hi. i have a question. do you think, there'll ever be a fifth category? oh that's a good question. like cuz you know how you said that there's ethnicity-based, states do you think they'll ever, eventually because the world seems to be going towards a, interconnected kinda, general like, you can be an American but there's no like, you're not it's not like you're German. you know you're American but you're of Italian descent. yeah um well i mean i guess you could say that there is in a way because, i mean this is just like a way of classifying right   right right  yeah that's really interesting we'll have to see. probably won't happen in this lifetime. i don't think so not too soon anyway but we'll see i mean you know no, it's a slow process. it is. 	1
COL999MX036.json	good afternoon. i, we decided that uh four P-M is really Michigan time which is ten after the hour or close to it. i'd like to welcome you. my name is Earl Lewis and i'm the Dean of the Graduate School and it's my pleasure, uh to have you and and Nancy Cantor be part of this evening, uh program in the afternoon at Rackham series that's been going on now for the last two and a half years. um thank you Earl i can't imagine a better person to be in the graduate school than you, so, okay um, it's wonderful, always for me to be back, speaking in Rackham um, a f- great fondness both for, this institution and this building and, for what it means um, for the university. er- as Earl said i'm_ when he, called me, quite some time ago to do this he said it was a series on American values and, um i hafta, say that i was just newly into the provost office then and thought, oh my gosh um, if there are questions we do have time, to answer a few questions and there will be a reception right after. but are there questions? uh Nancy um, i was uh very glad to read this summer that the administration had uh, increased the appropriation to the library, by ten percent uh this year and i think that's uh wonderful news for all of us, uh it's wonderful news for those especially of us who, come from the humanities side because, i think of this library as our, as our workshop our quarry uh where we get our building materials we use it a lot. uh but it's true for uh, for everyone, and uh people uh like myself who've used uh, research libraries in Europe know that there's nothing like the great American research library and ours is one of the best. uh so i'm very happy to hear about that, but i was little alarmed i knew there was gonna be a but to this, this_ i was a little alarmed when you said that you wanted uh, to get donors as interested in the library as they were in the stadium and i'm wondering if you're going to put a maize and blue halo (xx) i knew i couldn't get through today without hearing_ but we're not gonna put conquering heroes. okay Will now it seems that the present system is (competing) and i i wonder how we, address that nature problem i mean i_ there's no doubt that, that you know, we gain safety by locking away, a certain part of our population and i sit here and i say now isn't there something that we can do, in understanding quote the criminal mind or soon to be criminal mind so that we could sort of, start, affecting the competition. that's interesting... i mean there certainly is and we certainly have, many programs on this campus actually addressed 	1
OFC150MU042.json	so is this Kelvin?  yeah, (xx) oh wow okay mkay yeah, (xx)    alright okay, Wien's Law which is uh what is it like one over lambda-max equals, or actually it's like zero-point-two-nine isn't that what it is? something. do you have your book? yes. okay. see i understand the concept, but i don't understand (xx) okay. oh yeah see the real reason (xx) they're recording us, sometimes you get a little abusive of the tutors oh wow maybe i should step outside, cuz i don't you know (xx) so you know it's actually_ they're actually uh very uh, blatantly bugging the office, so okay the continuous structure mhm mhm mhm right the emission? yeah because it seems like it would be all of 'em if it's, continuous (emission spectra)  it's, the, the spectrum's going through a, fairly dense heat. okay. so it's going, like, the um... lambda-max that's, the, that's the wavelength of the maximum, on it, that's our radius (xx) T, as far as temperature. so, well let's think though, okay so, what causes absorption again? we're in a continuous spectrum, and it's going through, some kinda gas i can't remember okay like, hot dense gas  so, okay the (original) is emitted by the gas, okay? so, is the absorption, is, emitted, by it's still emitted by the source,  okay and that's, the, that's how you can tell which, element it is? yeah yes. because, certain elements will absorb certain, photons right mhm  (xx) the gas, this is where i get confused. yeah that's where i got it from, (xx) they're both emission, lines. (xx) piece, um, for spectrum. um, i was saying, i wanted to say yes, mhm (right) mhm, um okay do these (xx) right here, these two, um, mhm um, it depends how hot it is you know there's like, different degrees of hot (xx) (you see, i was confused) (xx) (red so then) okay so you said_ okay so, the neon tube is red so it's cooler than, the mercury tube, but there'd still be an emission, line so (xx) yeah (it's) just different, degrees of the emission. and so i mean if you're_ okay so if this is emission, and you're saying that even if you can say, that this bright red is cooler than that, and you're using Wien's Law. you can, tell the relative temperature. yeah yeah which is (xx) okay. (i wanna deal with that first.) mkay... why don't_ lemme just, lemme just consult, Charlie? wanna um okay if you've got, mm yeah uhuh uhuh um, Wien's Law only applies to continuous (does it?) okay  okay i had to get up by (xx) (xx) one twenty-six, okay one twenty-six? yeah oh, okay i think it's only uh, continuous. hm right right, yeah but, yeah that's that's true but see Wien's Law doesn't apply to all types of continuous spectra. yeah but for (no-) well, but for her, for her purposes, it'd probably be fine. um, let me just see. but then i don't understand why it couldn't be applied to absorption and emission, because, the reason is is because it's not continu- it's not continual? well, what happens is, you know what causes an emission law right? yeah, it's, through gas yeah so you have a a cloud of gas, what happens is there's a star behind this cloud of gas right? lets off radiation, this radiation and what happens in the gas actually, y- you have a little atom, what causes an atom to emit radiation? it can't absorb it? it absorbs it first sure, but after that (xx) mhm maybe you, it doesn't apply to the other ones. cuz you're not getting the entire spectrum. well if well y- the thing is is in absorption and emission, is uh, comes in at one wavelength, and that's why. like, like for instance here let me tell you, this is a this is an emission line, this is um absorb- or emission spectrum absorption ste- spectrum. i can't i can't apply this, here because when i, when the, the photon comes out from within the individual atoms, there's no temperature associated with it. there's just it just is, it's pure energy those could just be used to show what element it is? right exactly that's not, for temperature right i mean this, these, you can give off an emission spectrum at, you know two degrees you know uh, twenty-three degrees Fahrenheit or a million degrees Fahrenheit. you can have the same emission. you know but it wouldn't be,  right but yeah yeah because, the reason is just, when you look at this spectrum, what y- what you're gonna see is thing you're gonna see this curve this is like this is called a black body, it's like you look at the sun this is what it, the spectra looks like, okay? um, but see the emission, emission, uh, emission lines, if you looked at a spectra of just emission lines what you see, is, you'd see something like this right okay okay okay... hm, here, okay let me just get this real quick so i can (xx) um, so that means, can't use it to tell the relative temperature, because these are emissions lines, mhm right mkay mkay well, what do i wanna do first? we'll look at this and we say, compute? well, wanna calculate the maximum wavelength, at a given temperature, okay and this is, this kind of ties into the last problem now what kinds of spectra do you think these guys give off? in between the (xx) and (xx) hm, okay. okay, um, let me ask you this if it, well it depends on the lithium string on it right? if you're looking right at it it's gonna be absorption and if you're looking, not directly at it it's gonna be emission? not really um, if, if you, lemme lemme put it like this, you have a s- you have the sun, okay? mhm  mhm  (when) you're using electrons? exactly. exactly so you have a hydrogen atom, if it gets ionized what is the photon comes in, kicks that electron out so hard, it just goes away, it doesn't come back to the, um, so what happens is, you can you can imagine can do that with hydrogen, well you can do that with helium too, all you gotta do is kick out two electrons, and then you go on and on and on, you know you can keep doing any element you want. all you gotta do is basically, kick you know, kick out all the electrons in the, the shell, and absorb it. so, what happens is inside the sun, there really isn't any elements, okay? what this, what you see in there is just, you know a bunch of particles you know, and this is why it kinda causes it, and these particles are very hot cuz of the fusion (xx) and what happens is is uh does anybody remember how to derive, Wien's Law? Wien's Law? yeah oh, isn't that in the thermo book? is it in the thermo book? oh, probably is, okay. can i borrow your thermo book  i sent a nice letter to uh, the publisher oh yeah i did too i need to too because my book    yeah yeah i got a new one but um, so what happens is, let me put it this way, okay absorption spectra and emission spectra can only happen when you have, atoms around, and whole atoms okay? not,  did we (xx) this is that's, oh you said (xx) is that,  then you get a fluorescent, (xx) a bulb? yeah well you saw yeah you w- oh oh oh well it's yeah yeah, right, and then you looked, did you look at like a helium lamp did you see the pattern okay i really did not mhm yeah, it's just it takes me a while to get it  so what what we're looking for here, we're looking for something like s- s- these are all stars, okay? and these stars are red hot and these are these are, this is the surface temperature of the star, this isn't the (xx) so what we have to look at here is you know well, (these are things that are pretty well known...) pretty well missed um, how do you calculate hm? wait, just a sec well what kind of, spectrum, does a star give off? one-point-one-four (xx) i think that's... cuz, they say what is the Wein's Law applied to, continuous emission (xx) (it would) be continuous, wouldn't it? yeah i don't know if it applies to particles no  yeah cuz it comes from, the just the relation... okay. that makes sense. yeah, okay, i'm almost positive did you, get beyond that? yeah, because the relation itself, comes from relating um, lambda-max and temperature, of a black body. so this, relationship, is just like if you take, you know if you get a spectrum for a black body, mhm vaguely, yeah. i mean it's like, just, i mean, are you confused about? no, i kinda got it.  mkay so that's just trying to figure out how to calculate the yeah so yeah, alright, s- stars give off, what kind of uh, this would be uh? they give off what kind of emission? yeah, you've probably found (xx) there? what kind of radiation was i talking about earlier? black body  are you just trying to calculate yeah see it's just using that equation in the back. what is it three (xx) equation, yeah (xx) i didn't bring my calculator i forgot about this part, what's this? it's go- it's in scientific notation, so you'll have to change it. (it's in scientific nota-) yeah yeah, yeah there's, alright so you're whoa, alright (xx) oh my gosh they had this awesome laser pointer at um, Costco does it have a little arrow? it has arrows, and ha- like it has a dot with two arrows. it has a galaxy, a circle with a dot in it, it's really cool. (are you gonna switch) mhm twenty bucks. really? do you have to have a membership to work there? or to go there? or have a, boyfriend that has, a, dad who has a membership, that's pretty cool, i didn't think about it, like, twenty bucks really? yeah does it like (columnate it) or is it like, like when you go to the walls is it like (a big) blur? i don't know. yeah. and that's gonna give you that, that's like three hundred nanometers. wait no, there's three thousand nanometers? this is this is A-H yeah three that's yeah, that's three hundred  that's good, that's in the visibl- almost in the vi- visible range. okay. oops, i should have, how do you know that, you need to (xx)    (xx) you can't tell, (xx) you get, after everyone leaves, we can, pretend like we got into a fight. okay well, let's think about this, mhm i just put that and divided it mkay it looks about right. so what's the (xx) over there? (xx) over there oh the nanometers okay, this isn't  (xx) so the uh (xx) so what's this, this is three times ten-to-the-two, that's about three, that's what, so, how many nanometers, in scientific notation. not, i can't, see it in my head okay, well it won't be (written down) let's just, you know  uhuh right. and and this would be, five hundred and seventeen? yup,  yup, mkay, so what we wanna do we wanna look through okay and say what, this is the (P quadrent) this is where the m- most photons will be emitted, emitted by these stars. and uh, that's gonna tell us something pretty important, okay? so we say you know, well let's just look uh, let's look here. alright so okay, that's what i was looking for (xx) yeah, so what does it look like? this first one where does it look like it'd fit? three hundred millime- millimeters from there okay right and yeah i mean ultraviolet? yep, right, exactly hm, i knew it said zero so yeah i- um, color, it's U- it won't be U-V, um but what color is the closest to that, like in this right here? there? yeah, i mean yo- ultraviolet's correct for that, uh, okay okay okay, (xx) and seventeen, okay five hundred so, what's, what is it, five hundred and seventeen? so uhh, you know it's i know it's part of the other one yeah so let's see there's about f- (xx) ruler or a pen actually if you see, yeah so what would happen here we have uh, okay, so here's the distance, and this is about halfway, you  okay i'm still i still (wanna make sense) (xx) i know it so i can see it  okay. let's uh yeah i- it's crazy, yeah, you know, laws of physics are wrong, it's gonna be infrared,  mm, yeah, yeah. okay so let's let's think about this for a second. while we're (changing) the sun's supposed to be green? that's crazy. what's uh, what's going on here. well, it's different for this, so wha- what's the temperature? fifty-eight hundred. mkay, this is, here we are, that's that's cool. this is about six thou- it's about the temperature of the sun we'll move this over a little (xx) well, if you take a look at this, okay? this is mini- green at the maximum but, look at how much the yellow, red blue, a big conglomeration you know i mean it's i mean if it if it was like, if it went like this, and if_ i'm not gonna write in your book but you know if you know it went like, if if the spectrum actually went like this and went straight up here and was a real sharp peak, you'd see a green sun. but because it's, emitting all these colors they mix together i mean just like you know you, you've done that and like you've seen a red blue a red and blue light made (pink?) yeah okay oh, (i thought this was what you were talking about.) alright, thank you no problem. (xx) yeah yeah and, only one thing i want to point out to you, this, this is technically right, you just, you just probably wanna_ y- who's your T-A? John Spar. John yeah, tell John. yeah just tell John (xx) a- and he's not gonna, you know. you might wanna just mention to him just put, this really didn't have a color so i just put the closest color there (was) yeah, like i think i'm gonna fail, the test,  yes what are you gonna fail? the G-R-E.  okay i'll fail with you. (people are) allowed to fail, it'll be fine... i don't care. if i fail it's okay. i'm okay with that.  here i'll make you, i'm not gonna do any G-R-E studying tonight so don't worry about it. tonight yeah  you know it really sucks that (i think) what's his name's test is this week. i mean but i really want to do a lot of studying   really sucks, you know you really think about it, we have a test, right after and right before the G-R-E. (really sucks) very (xx) yeah the, one that's this Friday this Friday and what's what's the one after it? Christmas oh you tell her that. yeah. i know i should go in there and say hey you know what, by by you having the test on the the last (Christmas) day, you know it's gonna make you the better grad student cuz everyone else is gonna do worse yeah,  who? you jus- you should go thank Kent oh exactly yeah, grad school what's that?  you've you've been studying, you're okay you're you're okay, you're way ahead of me. why are you afraid? fear dude. fear of what?    i wonder if i like applied to like really a, good graduate schools with like really crappy Harvard three bad days remember, remember those uh, those, top places uh what was it like, throu- Cal Tech and Harvard, and stuff they said that, like, ninetieth to like, eighties   mhm yeah  yeah, i think that they_ oh, i mean i don't know, i'm not really sure but i think that they maybe have classes that are more oriented towards the G-R-E too. yeah, solving their  i don't know (well then) Grand Rapids.   yeah, i'm from Battle Creek so, that's cool Grand Rapids? yeah. i lived there all my life.  i love Grand Rapids. it's all quiet now you can  huh?  go ahead, no you know i could see you as like you could, oh you se- oh you could (xx) i was like trying to listen i was like, oh where are my glasses (xx) um, hold on...  (xx) oh... oh o- okay, i'm sure it's not that (overwhelming) i didn't even think about that. nothing w- i don't understand, this is like (done, so obviously) what are you doing? i was trying to start the, ten problems  do we have ten problems really? eleven eleven problems?  no it's nine   some large number nine problems hey guess what? what? none? oh no... you guys didn't do sh- chapter eight? wha- what is it called? you didn't do chapter eight did you? what is it on? heat engines.  don't you understand Charlie's telling you you didn't do chapter eight. i didn't do chapter eight. oh i know i wanna... huh, what was that...? four-oh-six i took it with C-J oh wha- why was it your class? in mine yeah if you were in my in four-oh-six with C-J you were in my class. oh no no no and and you didn't, okay, looks like i'll be starting (them) right now.  you didn't do it. Charlie just wants to get the upper hand Charlie's just (xx) you didn't do it? no Charlie's a cutthroat. we have nine this week i know dude don't let Charlie get up from behind you. dude what about that one dude today like, what dude? the dude, i i asked Professor Mott the question the dude just broke in like ah ah or something   that was annoying that pisses     oh i didn't even know what he was saying he was like molecules do this and not tha- no that seriously (xx) they're like (xx)   well you were mad at (xx)    what? you know what? yeah the, well why don't we, i'll do it right now i'll get on the net and i'll mkay  no don't order it we gotta go to a store or something cuz that'll take forever yeah software   we should buy that with S-A-S's money. yeah what?   buy what? it's only twenty bucks (xx)    exactly, you know yeah we should  yeah i- yeah yeah yeah yeah so you pirate software? no maybe. we- we- we'll pirate it. we'll sell it on the (Priceline) that'd be a cool thing to have up here, that it says like, in front of the library. yeah. damn,  we're like, immature, so uh, i don't understand how to do this cuz this is incredibly,  yeah after we take it in we'll just,  i bet we can sell it for fifteen bucks (xx) yeah... okay si- si since it's (anihi- complaint) bu- bue- (buena, buena) dumb ass. what are you guys doing? i don't know  a conspir- the alien bodies at the top of the ninth floor mhm actually there was this one night, somebody and i were going on the third floor, and we walked out and there was this like, um, scaffold kinda, in the hall, right? (like they were) housing alien bodies? mhm. this reminds me of uh, not really but this uh, Tom Clancy book i read. and there was like all these codes that they said to each other you know, well they actually wrote down everything uhuh. makes me realize how much i (xx) (mess around)  okay, okay no i can't write that in here, i don't have any paper to write it on. i'm gonna do it when i get home. shit i'm just gonna have to do it on my paper because i don't wanna write it on this this paper, i can't write an abstract of this, because i think i'll i'm gonna read the abstract and then write an abstract, i can't do that. summarize the abstract but that's silly.  mine didn't have an abstract. so i i don't know what i should do, like   i was thinking about yeah, your, paper was two pages long? so, yeah, actually i should, like rewrite my abstract for the summer, or something. yeah that's a good (xx) see i always break, (up the talk) via detail mm, yeah really?   did he say you could do that? he said, that you should give some background, yeah your abstract? from last years, double A-S oh yeah (xx) yeah i should turn in mine from, for this year's double A-S, oh you know what? (xx) remember writing one uh, (on the subject of) Stephen Hawking. what? Steve- yeah. did he have? like what do you mean the applying the well no i mean he's just like he did some    yeah su- but i said all that yeah i know i know dude you shoulda seen Li Ying dude, Li Ying just tore Stephen Hawking apart, really? Li Ying did this? yeah Li Ying. yeah yeah (xx) i wouldn't be surprised at all, Li you know Li Ying could probably, Li Ying can do anything. (xx) i'd be like Li Ying i need a gra- antigravity uh hovercraft for, this weekend he probably (xx) give me a couple minutes.  yeah i gotta no i got an hour i got an hour lunch break hold on,   did you put something in my, in   oh yeah,  about these grad schools and stuff? uh, yeah i oh yeah cuz Adam was telling me there was in the paper  i might have one in mine as well you can have. oh do you? if you could make a ph- photocopy actually you know what, there's one floating around here, is there one in mine...?  (xx) L- Li Ying (xx) yeah and need an antigravity   he's like, i i kind of need more (food, i'm, you'll) let me use it, two weeks from now, Tuesday... (xx) formal training yeah your brother tell ya? um, we went to, you know that, you remember that, you ever do the monkey problem in uh thermo? yeah the the  monkey on my what's that? yeah  and where's the little photocopier? it's like in this other room where the coffeemaker and stuff  what? she was just uh, making (xx) over there i didn't do it. did you do it? no, i didn't do it. i'm gonna do it nobody saw that movie called The Rocketman or whatever or    yeah yeah it was  yeah i i- it's been playing on Disney for a while, oh really?  y- yeah y- wait what was this? (what do you mean) really inaccurate? it's like he's going to Mars on the next like, yeah    yeah i saw parts  no okay cuz like, any time something happens, he's like wasn't me  oh i was just, i was thinking is you we- say he goes to Mars or something. yeah. i just saw Superman Four. yeah and he went to Mars? no no no no in Superman Four him, and Nuclearman you know the, Lex Luthor Luthor  Lois Lane? no no it's Lois Lane but no there's another girl Lana right? yeah that takes over the paper (xx) yeah Nuclearman, La- uh, was she in the story? she's got the black pants on. yeah exactly, and he walks into her office and she's like (laying on the desk) and says you mine well anyway this, the thing that was, she, he like grabbed her and, took her off into space, yeah  but Superman does that too in part one. he takes  i was gonna say, just imagine Charlie, how does rotating the earth backwards in time reverse- or backwards reverse time? well if you're gonna go let's think about that. um, anyway in The Rocketman, so like, there's this really big astronaut guy who's really pompous and so like he's m- made up this speech and everything for everybody he gets on Mars you know he's, going down the ladder and the, idiot guy's above him and he, slips and falls and accidentally is the first one on Mars and then he hi- the first thing he says is, it wasn't me, i didn't do it. pretty good  so you've been studying for the G-R-E i see huh? no, this was in the summer i watched it. uhuh yeah when did you finish this paper? what? when did you and you just finished it August ninety-eight? well no, submitted, uh, when i grad- when i (xx) but i jus- it just got published oh it takes two years to publish? no it's uh, i left not two years ago two summers ago so, it was summer of ninety-seven that i, we finished it, and then oh alright  oh yeah?    what's that, w- (exactly) yeah i yeah i'm not gonna be able to get mine done because they're not gonna get the new telescope out  Benson and i just keep doing new things  yeah, i'll be writing it out (actually) with a pen? isn't that hard to do? (i use a) pen. i can't stand pencils. i have uh, worked with you both it seems satisfactory, awesome. maybe you guys should be in a group of your (xx) like (flagstones) not to make, (joke) not to trul- trivi- trivia- trivialize you. but, it be more funny, i'm just k- uhuh  do you know how to find the probability of the (spin one) of spin what? spin one? and uh probability of S-C plus H and S-C minus H? I don't know how to circle it, this is what i_ wouldn't it be, twenty-five percent? is it uh something like this? um,  mhm is it something like like where you've got the integral of like S-H-bar over, omega, times psi-squared, or something like that? cuz that energy, equals S-H-bar-omega, and then um, like for the probability you have to do this over, (i don't know) it's the psi squared or whatever? whoa familiar? no no the- there's this part for uh, like, if you measure it in (C) so this is for uh, this is one half particle. okay okay   i'm gonna like, hang over your shoulder okay. what are you doing? hm? uh, this is homework we, it's kinda like our exam that we just took, so he wants us to do, kinda the same stuff again. Barney Cleaver and Mick Wal, (they're so weird) i've never done this, that's cuz everything we learned in nonintegrated quantum was completely uh, nuts (xx) um, yeah, (xx)  (xx) like Yao, Yao  Yao was like Yao was like Yao Yao like talked to the board, and like wrote down scribbles, and was like, finally three weeks into it turned around and was like this was blah blah blah he was like back to the board, and i was like  you know,   okay Chad drives me crazy. yeah, i don't know if you'd wanna be graded by Chad but, i'm afraid, of my grade that i got from Chad Chad's awesome, i got an A on my thesis. that's good you got an A on your thesis? yeah, i wrote my thesis with Chad okay. so you've done your thesis and (you're just) (xx) okay. cuz i though i was gonna graduate last year, but i decided (xx) astro major and i decided that (and i just) (xx) like i, am done   yeah (xx) (xx) huh? your G-R-E's done? yeah, uh, i've kind of (would've) written an abstract for,   yeah i know. (xx) (you're awesome) oh here's God's gift to (xx) i'm just God's gift to relativistic hydro- magnetohydrodynamics, (xx) could you imagine? (xx) God's gift to (xx) (thermodynamics) and what about Christopher, dude and smile oh really? i- if what? if he said what?    what are you talking about? nothing loo- look at our our garbage i think we filled up two i know it's really we need another one, we need another one, that's good   you wanna go ov- you stick your nose in there? who who empties them   what? let's get one of those big garden things i saw him today, i just don't think he's coming in. who is that? who Sparett? i think M-CAT or someth- it's not m- i'm not gonna worry about it. hey are you sure you're not gonna worry about it? and i was like ow, i think (xx) stomach muscle  i don't know why i didn't go for like, ten. i was trying to be tough. cuz n- like g- if you set it for lower, i- i- like you can do like more the s- even (in) the same day it like you just get like, you get used to it.  i did a lot, of sit-ups last week. oh yeah.   yeah like um i i showed her the one  what happened you were (xx) you stuck your head underneath there,   i was laying and there was this  like i'm an astrophysicist that's what i that's why astronomers in the weight room yeah i was like i was li- how the hell do you do this? this guy turned around i go to get a drink of water i turn around the guy's like you'd hurt yourself. no really  i don't know i'm trying to remember it but, you're like (yeah) oh that's not how you do it that's what he said, i thought he   yeah yeah  you're like, all my body is is to carry my brain. what'd you say? all my body is used for is  you guys were beat up a lot as kids weren't you? i have a symbiotic relationship between my body and my brain huh? i have a symbiotic relationship between my body and my brain so that's like (this is that?) it's like  oh, okay okay, good thank you that's cool. that'd be really cool if your brain did that. no i'm just kidding it jumps out of his chest or  what?  i got like a eight hundred C-C brain how's, that's big no it's not.  oh, okay i'm thinking seven hundred   (xx) head as big as a  just cuz he had a big head doesn't mean_ i mean   what was that? oh my god i think i had whoa that's, my problem, (xx) oh God, i'm  no i think that was equal to one can of Surge what? you had, two did you one time i had a NoDoz and i laughed for twenty minutes straight no stopping. an overdose  no- a NoDoz, i was like  try not to, be crazy so what are you up to tonight? well, i'm sitting here, right after this i'm gonna start doing some homework you know, stuff like that, that's cool Anne are you okay? no i'm, a little, crazy tire you out she's silly (xx) i think it's the, the increased metabolism (xx) not sure, about the combination (xx) get outta here (sweet) Ch- Charlie are you afraid that yours doesn't hold up to par with the rest of ours, is that it? no, i'm just seeing what i can do here to improve this yeah, whatever (xx) huh? we know, we know how it goes. you had your power ring, you transformed. yeah yeah see you (xx) i uh, you going to the meet? i'm going to definitely try (to go to the meet) (xx) Tuesday and Thursday, Thursday and Wednesday (xx) i'm, i'm trying to make it at least (xx) as possible, (xx) uhuh okay alright see you okay. i'll see you tomorrow morning. okay. (xx) equals... well, okay that's actually, that's actually more accurate okay so then, (xx) and it turns into this (xx) yeah well... okay, here you have, (xx) okay, here we need to draw a triangle. (xx) well, y- it's gonna be (kind of an) elongated triangle okay? so we have, we have the center of the nebula (xx) and we have the (remnant here...) so, like, you know that this distance, (xx) point-three-one parsecs so that's what we just, figured out we just figured out, okay and so here's the earth... the triangle like this. now, what else do you have that can help (you?) (would) the diameter? mhm right here? so that's this area down here. so we have, (xx) yeah yeah you know you know it's really uh, tangent (xx) oh, okay (is that,) oh the tan of five-point-two... (xx) i don't remember and all that stuff. well you mighta used the small angle formula. (xx) tangent i, i have the tangent. P, oh, but um, that's not degrees, that's, that's... they actually want it. (xx) remember, tried that formula for a little while, remember where that was? um, page nineteen? nineteen. (xx) make, (thirty-eight) and then (xx) forty eight, no no no no not not that one nope this one the one i found in the notes? small angle formula? does that sound  yeah, that's what i thought. yeah, in chapter two or one... page eight or nine. um, page eight or nine? yeah okay i think that's what it was right,  well how do i switch it from arc minutes to degrees? um, i don't know (xx) how many arc seconds? one degree is sixty arc minutes okay so, um one-sixtieth? mhm okay, so then we have arc (xx) minutes? and okay, take the tangent of that. the tangent, (xx) oh sorry that's okay this looks like (xx) alright let's make a short one (look like this.) um, okay so you have, (xx) this you have to use, pi... um, cuz this is the whole, like this is, this is one-point- four. this whole oh i'm totally (xx) you're doing it (xx) okay so this is so okay, um, okay you know that this is what's this (xx) point-three-one... this is... and this is five-point-two. so this, makes a triangle... three-point-six (arc) minutes and, this yeah i i think, this is, this is gonna (xx) answer there and i'm trying to figure out why this one's (xx) so this one's wrong? one of 'em is wrong, (xx) (xx) because like, this is pretty close, you know? um, what did i switch? (xx) i switched the angle. right mhm?.. so the (xx) uhh, well, for this one you wanna use (xx) um, sixteen? um... times three-point, oh-one? okay this is the number i get here. (xx) this one different? yeah i get s-  (xx) yeah well what was i doing? i don't know. (xx) i just don't know how to yeah, actually but this one you should, redo using, this the halves? okay. so, (xx) yeah it's like a (xx) okay good, i was gonna do that later. okay did you have another question? oh yeah i have lots of questions (xx) i don't know. i missed the (xx) one day and i don't know what's up. um, number two, it's (xx) remnants. and i had something (xx) neutrons that were, uh (have you studied) neutron stars? yeah cuz these are, solar masses (xx) is that wrong? what about black holes? oh, well this one could be, right? but what about that one? i thought it had to be more than ten. um, technically more than three, but um oh really?  it's younger? how do you know it's younger? well, i- because um, it's more massive, you know if it's more massive then i- it's evolving, more quickly. oh okay it will be and what does the temperature have to do (xx) oh that's the hottest one (xx) right? mhm yeah cuz it's burning things faster. okay so that would mean (it'll be a) black hole (instead of a neutron.) probably i mean you know it's gonna be one or the other but since it is twenty-four masses, okay (xx)   yeah neutron stars can be between two and three, the thing is like if you have a ten, ten solar mass, star, it's gonna lose a lot of its mass at the end of its life you know when it goes through a giant and it like, goes supernova and stuff and so if it loses, you know seven solar masses it can be a neutron star but this one, it's gotta lose seventeen solar masses, at the least  okay okay and this one, we don't know? i mean what does this have to do with it. like does that help me tell? this one? yeah um, well you know, it's gonna be a little older, we know it has (seven different) chemical composition okay i don't know what i did. i took off the wrong part again... okay. so this one i don't know about?  not much well, do you, have your book? yeah, where did it go? is this your book? yeah. really? you guys still use the fourth edition? yeah (we still have that one.) oh... um, do you know which chapter it is? twenty-three or four. (xx) look at (earlier) today but i still don't know... twenty-three  twenty-two (or whatever,) let's see yeah this book, has some, sort of, like it doesn't, lay things out so that (xx) can, um, okay okay see why does it ask specifically? (do you) wanna know about the end of (xx) s- end of the lives well, we're gonna also have a supernova and (xx) like it's gonna (xx) so i put, just i don't so should i just say supernova (xx) like you wanna say supernova but you also wanna say say what's left in the core which'll be, a black hole or a neutron star. so i alright, could that be hm? it's not, it's referring to a different one but yeah, it's the sun do you remember what happens to the sun? in all those years, it's gonna turn into, what is it gonna turn into? a black hole? it's not massive enough it needs to have at least three  mhm mhm, because, a white dwarf is, anything that's up to one-point-four-four solar masses. so, like if it has more than that, you get a supernova okay okay so since it's one to begin with it's not gonna be more than that right? mhm, but you're also gonna hafta blo- like it's gonna be a supergiant, before it becomes a white dwarf and all that stuff from i- from the supergiant is (xx) (right there?) yeah, but  like what gas is it? yeah well, you know what? what does the gas look like? what is that called? (xx) (xx) okay... i know it's (xx) so it's like this is a cool star? yeah it's a cool star and you know it's not gonna be real massive so it'll probably be a white dwarf as well? most likely (you're) just guessing (xx) and then um, (xx) the last one, collision is between two dwarfs well, you know, there are the mass limit of white dwarf, is one-point-four solar masses, combined with one-point, the one-point-eight so you know that it, um so that's a, (supernova?) yeah you're gonna have, see you're gonna like it's gonna, it goes supernova (xx) so you know you're gonna have (xx) it's gonna have (xx) more than one-point-four (xx) since this is one-point-eight and it's, gonna be less than three, yeah yeah so this is gonna be uh um, i think you have (my) mass, cuz it says (xx) and then i get the G, from the book and i got this from the book and i just plug them in and i, mhm yeah  okay okay so that one i can (xx) but what is this one? it's asking about the universe like if it was all a black hole so you know you have... you know, you'll you'll find the radius (xx) you just want the radius, the radius of the (sun) you assume it's (xx) and so then you have to find the volume, cuz density is mass per unit volume, so okay okay, cuz this is, cubed right? what? um, four-thirds-pi-R, cu- cubed okay, oh that's just for a square would be length? (xx) (or something) yeah for a cube yeah cube, right. so four-thirds-pi, four-thirds-pi-R-cubed right? or is that wrong? (xx) so that's all i do (xx) yeah, well that's, well that's all you, you know you have mass over volume right and so that's all i can say for that. and i (xx) cool oh my gosh i took this pad again. every time i go to_ every single week that i go to physics tutoring i leave with a pad of paper. okay so uh, starting with? um, i don't really (xx) okay okay  uh, fourth edition uh, Universe? so y- y- you're the one who (xx) aha (xx) (xx) i, used it once but no, not really. okay. (xx) the right chapters (i don't know) it might be in chapter nine so the first one says uh alright i can do that... cuz usually his questions don't really just, pertain to one chapter  i don't know if there is a, chapter where it's, talks about, f- f- formation of the solar system (that you can see.) it mentioned the stars (xx) okay yeah probably right but, it probably looking ahead? yeah (something like that,) okay so, (xx) it's obviously some (xx) so um, that it all formed from one main, solar nebula. right, and uh, it said here that, the, the model mhm okay, alright   probably would be, (xx) orbits? yeah  um, actually,  oh that's right yeah  right so, i don't know how uh... okay wait here we go, um, which planets did they say? very important okay mm yeah    yeah what is this say probably be- because, they have a larger area, of gravitational pull (xx) mkay i know it looks  (xx) well it mention them right here although, um mhm okay not exactly. okay okay, so let's see here, i don't know how, planet earth, they probably go through all the planets yeah, yeah i think they (do) i think they do this is really strange you have to, is this like a review for? this is the last assignment before the midterm (xx) okay it's just very strange that (xx) so this one will have to be even more abstract than, some of the others. mkay, that's weird all this (xx) Jupiter came from the Roman gods, you know give me credit.  wow oh mm something like that, we started down that list. yeah, i think actually it says in here somewhere, right? (xx) oh yeah, (just,) where did i read that i just read that. um, solar hypothesis, um, oh where did we see the first, solar hypothesis? probably in chapter nine here i'll help you find out. (i don't know) alright.  (xx) think it was page uh, four-oh-three. (xx) let's see if it's still back there, passing (stuff,) earlier, oh here we go... okay if, that might, (xx) yeah okay yeah, this is (xx) so it's like, something you're gonna have to look up. yeah, um let's start, in the index yeah he must be using the (xx) the chapter kinda thing you know it? yeah that's kinda strange, has he assigned readings? yeah he assigns readings on the first, twelve chapters (xx) it's right here chapter twenty-eight? (i don't know,) but i don't know how to study from (now on,) just go on to the higher chapters  nothing don't don't pay attention. i'll talk to you later (xx) um um, coded messages more, more talking about me, like when i'm (like) still in the room? (yeah) (xx) you know (xx) i would imagine that's probably alright there yeah i think i think that most of it's in the book yeah... yeah (xx) so that i mean i don't know, yeah okay. do you have questions, about those geosynchronous orbits? well yeah it was it's probably (right here) anyway and and they give you the kind of questions (xx) questions (xx) distance of a quasar (xx) or something i mean all, that you have to do, is know um (xx) so you wanna, you wanna make sure that your, period, equals um twenty-four hours right? cuz, w- you know you're going the at same rate (as this one) and uh period equals uh what is it like two-pi-V over R? okay  okay i can do that (xx)  (xx) okay, okay so you (xx) by satellite, two-way mirror, watch (xx) pairs so alright so you've got, um, so you've gotta do like resolutions here, mhm yeah okay  yeah it'd probably be in the light chapter okay, mhm oh oh okay uh, okay (uh let me check?)  (xx) exactly (xx) flip through (this so) i can remember  okay okay okay i'm usually (passed out at this point) so you're gonna find alpha in terms of arc seconds, okay? okay mhm mhm (xx) okay right okay kind of refreshing (me) yeah and this is how you're gonna find D. okay okay (doesn't it) have to be in agreement? hm? do they have to be in radians (xx) i think it has to be in_ actually, it's more like a formula, you know um, R equals D, theta, radians? R equals D theta_ um  yeah i think it's radians, that's what makes, i think it's, radians is it or? uh no it's uh s- it depends on w- on how you set up you have         what's that? two-oh-six-two-six-five that's the number of, arc seconds three hundred sixty um, i just looked it up you just looked it up and it was right? yeah okay i actually spent a a you know a good fifteen minutes  okay (xx) actually have it i don't know. four eighty-two. yes, see? the angle diameter mhm okay i think it does yeah okay so there's the formula that you're using  (i don't know, somewhere) somewhere up there. yeah, ah perfect. alright so, then um, what would the orbital period, be? do you have any idea how you might go around uh, go about, doing that? orbital period? mhm okay let's see (xx) so you know, that um okay (amount of) time? yeah just to w- well, but i mean it wants to stay in the same place, so what kind of an orbit is that? oh um, so what kind of orbit the one (the) satellite's in let's see here. let's go back to this geosynchronous stuff. yeah geosynchronous? uh, page four-eighteen four-eighteen? really? i think so i think it was what question was it? number i- it's uh, it was number, three three? yeah i just didn't know which one number three, i don't have  okay um we haven't used this, this equation but we've used these first two okay this one is just um, if you plug, this one into here, if you set these two equal? okay yeah i (know how to do that) yeah okay so you got_ i'm just gonna skip the squaring part and just gonna skip the squaring part and (xx) four-pi, uh, R-squared over, P-squared right? bring that R over so now you just (rewrite) this so P is brought over here. this equals, four-pi-R-squared, now times another R, divided by (xx) which is that (xx) okay yeah, oh yeah, it's in_ it's right on the back cover (xx) right there, (xx) (xx) that's awful (xx) probably like (xx) mass of the earth, is like, six times ten to the twenty-fourth so just plug that in there you know G mhm okay actually that's alright and then so, this  (xx) what? i was just, (xx) oh, it might have been a  (xx)  (xx) (like tested) on...? cuz he wrote down some, pretty funky stuff too. and i was like oh my god i was like um thermo oh, okay okay. (that's scary) um, i don't know if, terminal velocity may come in or not no okay okay okay that's probably (xx) okay. is that good? it's yeah, it's, (xx) okay i hope i helped. oh, definitely. okay good. (xx) (Chris) made me go in front oh again?   i was like i know, but cuz i was like   i know i was like no, sh sh who, the  i don't think anybody knows her name. she never passed out a syllabu- syllabus, did she? no but, i have a question (um) aren't we supposed to go to some events? yeah yeah, (xx) stuff, performances. (xx) any event (xx) yeah, pretty much. i think that like, some she prefers over others, cuz i heard people like talking to her and stuff. how do we know? oh you have to ask her? yeah um, Lisa and I are going, on Wednesday, i think to a performance (xx) yeah, yeah like i i had two other classes here, two other dance classes, and like usually it was like, two pages, you know just kinda like describing, what you noticed and, you know okay so this is (what) a jazz thing or can we go to like a tap thing, cuz i love tap. um you can, you can probably go to tap. tap's close enough. i mean, you might wanna say like hey, i have this tap performance uh, i went to see it uh, can i use it for my paper? yeah, well if can ever figure out her name. is that rude to ask her like, what's your name? you kn- i don't, nobody, anybody i've talked to, nobody knows. no one ever knows? i think, Eva probably knows. cuz Eva's friends with her. oh they're oh okay. i gotta ask them, (at least cuz it's bugging me) yeah i think it's like something with an M, like yeah  oh you do? yeah but, it was kind of as a result of this class, so like i was like, oh, great yeah you know well you know sitting, you know (just) basically just squatting for you know,   this, another girl in the class had tendonitis too. really? which one? i don't even know her name. i don't know her name either. what does she look like? what did she l- i don't remember it was like, three or four weeks ago. i just heard her talking about it,  i think something was wrong with her but i don't know (xx)   okay  did you  yeah she makes us stay in that stupid flat back forever i know and she'd be like one more time one more time one more ti- okay no, i'm standing up i'm done i hate that you had to stay with your arms. my arms get more tired than anything else, like okay this is like i'm gonna get good shoulders by the end of the class but no i always like drop 'em on the plie i'm like yeah whatever, i don't care if she (notices) i don't care she'd never say anything to me she doesn't even know my name so, yeah she, onl- all she says to me is, hold in your stomach, hold in your stomach. i'm like, like today i was like ah i had my stomach held in so hard i was like (xx) which class is this? jazz jazz? jazz dance ohh and the bad thing is i used to take jazz when i was younger. (xx) well i used to, like i took, a lot of modern. i didn't take much jazz, but i took a lot of modern and i'm taking some ballet so, i mean, you know plies whatever you know, (xx) i took a like a few years of ballet but i took mostly tap. yeah i did tap in a show, (like) i had four tap numbers and i had never tapped before (and they're like) oh really? that's my favorite though. it was great, it was a lot of fun. yeah i like the class  see it's my second class and that's why, like oh really?  was she mad? no,  yeah i did that too. that's, the day of my exam and i just talked to her after class and i'm like, i had an exam, i'm sorry  but she was saying she was though, she was like you miss the first five minutes, you gotta (stay)   yeah there's a lot like you know every once in a wh- like, i'm always afraid that she's gonna single me out, but she always, like, i stand behind, Alia and, Shana. the reason i know their names is because   yeah, oh yeah i know who she is. and which one is she? she's Alia. that's Alia? yeah. and then Shana's the one th- s- standing next to her today. she had a white shirt on, glasses, African-American... she has glasses? yeah. yeah sh- i think she's the only person in our class with glasses. okay yeah, yeah. is she real tall and skinny? yeah, tall and skinny. okay.    she always makes Nancy and Brenna  Abdia and, yeah and then those girls that are always in the front like, they just kinda rotate like (take it that's fine) it's like yeah, i'll just stay to the back i don't like it t- that guy to the front. he love's it. he is      oh no, but the other guys are shy. especially the  i know, he's funny. no one, like  i know he was like, not there for like two weeks like, he joined the class really late. he wasn't there, any of the time cuz it was only that one dude (xx) what's his name? John? uh John Peter John Peter. John something cuz he was talking about how he was J-P today cuz like, with the music they were saying J-P and he's like yeah, J-P yeah (it says) J-P  and she was scared to play that, who cares? i, i didn't eve- i wasn't even listening to it. like i listened for the beat but  i don't i didn't even no-     that's true when my friend was taking this aerobics class and they said you can only play certain types of music. that's why i thought we had the same tape every week. she was saying you have to only, go through all this stuff to switch your music. cuz they asked, to change the music maybe she was just telling  oh i like it  yeah, that's my favorite one. yeah, that's awesome th- i like, that's my favorite (xx) like weirdo stuff yeah, i was like yeah, whatever she's playing i_ as long as i can find the beat i don't care i like that class (i like) yeah me too, it's fun. you know except for (xx) except for_ yeah, (xx) how do you su- walk, at the beginning of class, i just was not able to walk. i mean i could walk but i (would be) in pain, like what's wrong with me i know she, she gives us (xx) i my, i get sore here  but you know, i feel like i'm getting a workout. you know at least i start, you know, get a little (xx) exercise yeah, me too. sometimes like all classes like five, four classes i've took. do you really? oh, s- i my schedule's all broken up, so mine's not. Monday and Wednesday that's the worst. see like i have class, nine ten, ten to eleven, then i have lunch hour for me to like, get ready for class, class till one then i'm done. see i'm in class till five-thirty (xx) do you really? (i know) psychology. that's my major, (xx) but the lab i need, it was four to five-thirty so oh wow. gotta do it  oh  is it a big difference? well, one-oh-two is, you know like, (stars) and galaxies and stuff and one-eleven is the solar system   oh okay oh okay  uh, it's not so bad. i almost studied psychology. really? yeah, my my dad's in psych, so oh what does he do? hm?  oh okay. they get crazier people there. yeah they get a lot of crazy people there yeah here too though uh, yeah yeah, (okay) i have homework so i'm sorry  oh do you ever do physics tutoring? mhm  six to eight?  do they pay you (xx) it's all volunteer. i thought the university paid you. 'm'm it's volunteer through student groups. really oh, cuz my friend he does tutoring for um, engineering or  oh i thought it did. oh wow that's nice of you. we'd like to think so well it kinda also    yeah we take the pop, for fifty cents a ca- fifty cents a can we're thirsty well yeah, it's like you put fifty cents in the (xx) oh that's for you thing? oh i didn't know that. oh no no that's not for tutors. that's just if you want pop. yeah yeah that's how we fund ourselves, we we we buy pop from Meijer and then just sell it again for fifty cents,  but it's not like you know you're not required to buy it when you come in    yeah the question's (xx) yeah so, i mean, and physics i have physics G-R-E so, oh   yeah it's_ and the physics help is from six to eight on Mondays  it's uh, on the first floor of Angell. oh in the lab? cuz my  yeah, no but, we usually have it, six to eight, on Mondays, so (xx) next semester too or, um, probably. Annie are we continuing S-P-S tutoring next semester  (xx) next semester that's cool (yeah it's) that's awesome oh good (good) no cuz (you know) (xx) oh that's awesome yeah i was excited like (xx) good like that that makes me feel good  no you told me the right answers last week so i know (xx) cool, very cool. alright? okay yeah, see you Wednesday.  you too. we should have like evaluations. for what? tutoring? yeah. of who? for, you know students to evaluate the tutors. (well) that might get a little personal we might get a little upset, but (xx) um, we  yeah we should have a little like, contribution box. if your tutor was nice to you today or complaints complaints yeah, (complaint box) that girl, all she did was giggle and had no clue what was going on. the girl, drank too much Pepsi when i was there, she made me feel uncomfortable i didn't fe- i felt, beyond mistreated. that's w- we're under investigation right now. i bet that's the, Cancer Man  all the sudden they'd  hm? i apologize for him (xx) he's watched the X-Files too much 	1
LEL320JU147.json	okay i think we can cut here... so this is part of a sort of thirty-two minute, video uh, film, recording the process of the the making of Spiral Jetty, but you get a kind of idea that you maybe didn't get it so well, during lecture of... of how significant the process is to, the actual meaning behind the piece, and how, you know you look at it and say like how the heck was that made? well literally with a bull dozer right, scooping up huge uh, loads full of, stones rocks, earth basalt salt, and, creating the sort of uh, the the spiral itself, you know foot by foot going back, loading up going back, and you also saw on the clip, uh Smithson the artist himself right walking out into uh the water to set up the sort of stakes, so it becomes if you remember when we were talking about minimalism and the idea of phenomenology, he becomes very physically implicated and present, right in the making of the work, (cause) he connects sort of bodily with the environment, as he stakes out, the perimeter, the sort of path uh, that the spiral jetty will take. so we see, ooh, you know this is the coolest thing to watch in reverse, i don't know if you have reverse, but uh, it's a cool video to watch in reverse... Seagram very good, whoever that was. Seagram building. this is by Mies Van der Rohe. Mies Van der Rohe the Seagram building, built in the late nineteen-fifties, and on the right, any gamblers in the audience? it's Las Vegas New York New York oh sure everyone can recognize New York New York in Vegas, yes. was it fun? they have a really nice roller coaster. they have a really nice roller coaster. just like th- just like Manhattan. yeah, no. uh, so we've got New York New York on the right a simulation of New York city, right, in Las Vegas. a simulation, um, but not as, big right it's sort of, do you know how big it is in relationship to the real thing, in terms of scale? (it's pretty small) relatively speaking small but from a distance it gives you this idea of, the high-rise, so New York becomes a kind of icon, uh symbolized by what, i'm trying not to walk away from mics, from, with the high-rise can you recognize any of the buildings? Chrysler, i think, Empire State, and of course on the left-hand side, the Statue of Liberty, located... in the middle of water, near Ellis Island? no, in the middle of Las Vegas, lend me your weary. uh, i was gonna make some joke about you know, desperate gambling but, but i won't cuz Las Vegas is about so much more. albino tigers, magic, the Rat Pack, glamour, and uh, fakeness right? the idea of, a kind of fake substitution for the real thing. so Mies Van der Rohe on the left this is not an example of postmodern architecture but instead, high modernism. modernism with a capital M something that we are_ we've become increasingly familiar with. and how do we know? what do we_ how do we characterize it stylistically when we look at it? is there a lot of ornamentation going on? no. no, so very sort of streamlined, sparse_ actually if you look at it close up, Mies Van der Rohe the architect who coined, the cliche, what's become the cliche form follows function, alright so very sort of streamlined aesthetic, uh, a- literally where you ca- you can sort of see the construction, on the exterior of the building. and in fact if you had a detailed slide of this building we would see, just this teensiest tiniest little bit of applied ornament he's taken, um, steel I-beams and actually placed them on the exterior of the building going vertically, so real vertical emphasis here right. and those I-beams don't actually serve as support, they in a sense mirror the internal, skeletal framework of the building, but they in a sense become, a kind of, uh, ornament if you will, although extremely subtle, extremely refined, extremely spare. so in contrast with this idea of, high modernism something changes, in the sixties seventies eighties and nineties. and i'll say from the outset that, the term, that P word, postmodernism, is extremely contested, amongst scholars and critics, art historians, for example, and other theorists. not agreed upon. you know, don't you wish one time i could come in here and just say you know this equals that? wouldn't that be n- what a what a happy world we'd all live in. but no, here i am again. you know, it's a can of worms just like, that big modernism word was a can of worms and so is the avant garde. some theorists have thought about postmodernism, as a kind of radical break from modernism. so a radical shift from, the kind of, sort of stylistic, and theoretical example set by somebody like Mies van der Rohe. others however argue that it's merely a continuation, of modernism. others still a parody, of modernism. but generally speaking there is a kind of recognition that, in the art produced sort of post-sixties, in the visual culture produced post-sixties, a lot of, that work is concerned with articulating, a crisis, a crisis um, that speaks to, sort of questioning the cultural authority, of, the so-called west. of western European culture, and institutions. so a questioning of that kind of authority that we have seen established, uh sort of throughout the twentieth century really. so one critic, wrote in the late seventies, quote WAC. oh.  Lavender Mist. Lavender Mist. do you remember the date? nineteen-fifty right that's sort of the date that we have for him. and on the right the artist? Andy Warhol. Andy Warhol and, the title? The Marilyn Diptych The Marilyn Diptych, sixty-two, and the process? photo silk-screen photo silk-screen. so what we have beginning in the sixties, right with an artist like Warhol that we've seen or perhaps, somebody like Rauschenberg, and we've talked about this before, a real revolt, against, the version of modernism that critics like Clement Greenberg had been proponents of. so rather than, a history of modernism as the logical unfolding toward, uh, Jackson Pollock, and abstract expressionism, a group of artists, who were working in very different ways, and continue, uh sort of passed down to other artists in the seventies and eighties, instead wanting to explore the kinds of contradictions and contingencies involved, in art-making in the social world and the political world at the time. so really against this kind of de-politicized version of modernist high art, against the idea of high art, uh as being formally pure, against this idea of purity, against the idea of autonomy, and the desire instead to re-merge art, with life. aura. attacking aura right? we see that pretty clearly with Warhol, in the sense you know i talked about this a little bit with, the Marilyn Monroe and the repetition of her face, both in color and then black and white as it sort of fades out, this idea that there is, uh a kind of unbridgeable distance, from the original. there's no way to get back to the original in the Warhol in a sense because, what are we getting back to but a film-still icon, of, Marilyn Monroe. a kind of self-created, uh studio-created image of the star. so there's this idea of how do you even g- where is the original here? how do you even get back to an original? is there even a possibility of an original in this work? and without the presence of th- of an original, how can there be aura? how does this complicate, uh through photographic reproduction, that idea of Benjamin's of the existence of aura, and how crucial the idea of aura is, uh to understand the kind of value attributed to, the gestural abstract expressionism of a painter like Jackson Pollock? so we- we're seeing this contestation of the uniqueness of the work of art, really intensifying in the past three decades sort of taking off, with artists, in the sixties and continuing to be questioned through different kinds of, uh pictorial strategies, in the seventies eighties and nineties and really, again what better medium to exploit, and explore, uh this idea of, aura and authenticity than, with the photograph? 	1
LES305MU108.json	okay everybody have a, copy of this, handout? okay, um, excuse me. i was going to um, once again make an attempt to um, uh place names to faces but uh, seeing that we're a couple minutes behind, i may have to wait and do that on Thursday. so again to (xx) assist me what i would like you to do is uh, uh keep more or less the same seats you had uh a couple of weeks ago or a week and a half ago last time we met, uh to assist me to uh, make a correlation with what i wrote down. okay what i would like to do today, uh is, continue the discussion about time, and in doing so, what i'd like to do is to make sure that you have, uh a good understanding of the difference between absolute time and relative time a topic that i think you discussed with uh, uh Professor Lohman last week. uh so to, lead off today's lecture we're going to be i'm going to be asking you questions about these terms and what they mean to you, and then very quickly review uh, the Geologic Time Scale. uh the handout i just gave you, has a summary of the Geologic Time Scale it looks like it's a very, involved, uh list of names and so on but there are a few basic concepts i'm going to point out, that you should remember, in order to facilitate future discussions you're not going to have to memorize all the names you see on there, i'm just going to point out the important, uh items in a minute. uh after we've done that, i am going to again ask you some questions about uh, uh sedimentary units, how they become so extensive as to cover an entire state or perhaps even, uh a large section of a continent, and, partly, to answer the questions we're going to ask about stratigraphic correlations, we will, go into what are known as transgressions and regressions. so number four, is really the answer to number three. and then if time allows at the very end i will introduce, uh radioactivity. okay? so let's begin, by revisiting uh this issue, of relative time versus, absolute time. anybody else, need a handout? you need one as well? okay saying something is older or younger than something,     alright uh i think like that layer one sediment was deposited  okay, so the first thing that happened one through five was deposited  um, the dikes C B then  Drew. Drew, excuse me, Drew, dikes C B then A. okay dikes were then emplaced in that order, C B and then A. ha- how do you know they're in that order? because B overlaps C and then A overlaps B okay it is because of the concept known as, crosscutting relations, okay so this is cross, cutting sedimentary rock, um layer C, um, uh, is placed on top of the, you mean most sediments were were deposited? the sediment, after one, two four,   yeah well that will happen at some stage, but before we worry about the deposition of unit six what i would like us to worry about, is what happened, along this unconformity. an unconformity being, really, a surface of discontinuity in other words it's a surface along which there has been, erosion. but before erosion can take place, okay let's revisit the issue of deposition. units one through four, were deposited let's say in the ocean, this is a marine sequence if i didn't mention it already. uh, can we, erode, units that are still underwater? can sediments that happen to be, underwater, be eroded? yes they can? (a hurricane) there's a movement of water, okay okay now, if we have, significant currents in the oceans, yes sediment can be, moved around. but when it is moved around, it goes from one place to the other, alright, and we still have deposition taking place so in other words if my ocean basin is like so, exposed. it has to be exposed, right? in order to develop a significant erosion or surface, our sediments have to be exposed to the elements. in other words, we need rain, we need rivers, we need, uh wind, all of those, uh factors that are going to, uh help weather down or erode the surface, uh so that uh we develop what is known as an unconformity. so that brings us to the point of what happened to number five. it could very well be, that unit five had been deposited along the surface right on top of number four. but, because of the erosion that occurred, unit five was removed. but it is also possible, that unit five was never deposited in the first place. how would we know then that unit five, ever existed if it wasn't deposited right here...? yes. it wouldn't be if, if it was ever deposited it wouldn't completely, erode it away right? okay w- w- what we're, saying here really, is that uh we would be comparing, the cross section we are looking at right here, to a cross section we might be able to see in another cliff let's say a hundred kilometers away. so a hundred kilometers away, and by the way that's where we're going to start talking about stratigraphic correlations, we may be able to observe a hundred kilometers away, units one two three four five and then six. that's how we infer, that a unit five ever existed. cuz we see it some other place where it was not eroded away. okay? that's how we know, that unit five existed but in this particular location, uh it has been eroded away. okay, so having said, that, uh, you know profound amounts of erosion will take place only if these rocks are exposed to the elements, what would you say then happens, after the emplacement of dikes A B and C. what must happen Cliff? like the sea comes back or wha- it, gets deposited under water again? okay we need sea level to do something don't we, right? in in in other words if these rocks are initially under water, but now we want, them to experience a period of erosion, that means that either sea level drops weathered away? what's that? it's weathered away? um... eroded? it's eroded by by, currents is that what you're saying? no look either sea level can drop so that my rocks become exposed to the surface, so that wind and rain and so on are going to start working on those rocks and erode them away, or what else can happen, mountain building processes? couldn't that part get pushed up? okay we can have tectonic deformation exactly. the sediments themselves, can be uplifted. and that's what we can summarize as sediments from, other areas? well, yeah sediments will eventually come into a basin but i'm telling you that these are marine sediments, putting in, (time on it) okay so putting in numerical value, to, a geologic event. how can we put a numerical value, to a geologic event that this must have happened fifty-three million years ago. how do we get that number? looking  okay radioactive decay alright so this absolute dating, as we shall see at the end of today, or beginning of next hour, is going to be based on, this is, a numerical value, and the numerical value's going to be based on, uh radioactivity. now well before radioactivity was discovered, anybody know when radioactivity was discovered?  eighteen ninety-six eighteen ninety-six, right eighteen ninety-six was when radioactivity was discovered, but by that time, uh geologic mapping had been going on, for probably two hundred three hundred years, okay two hundred or three hundred years. and the geologic mapping that was done early, used concepts of, relative dating, to come up with divisions and this is where i'm going to mention what i think you should remember. divisions of time, that we can cut into sections like there is a section right in here, known as the Cenozoic, don't they, um they assume that all, the whole universe is, or, all the other, space were, made at the same time and then they, find the age of the rocks then okay so this is an assumption that uh, she's pointing out that we'll come back to a little bit later. we have to make an assumption about, the age of all the objects in the solar system. our earth has been churned around, so that the rocks that, existed on its surface initially are no longer there. okay those rocks have disappeared, they've gone inside the interior of the earth, so that we have to make the assumption, that all the other bodies in the solar system that haven't undergone this churning of the surface, formed at the same time, as the earth did. and we'll be evaluating that assumption when we come to that uh, uh discussion in another uh few lectures from now. okay so, this age for the earth four-point-six billion years, is really based on dating meteorites. okay these objects that, come flying through space and fall right here on on earth, are the ones we use to date the earth or dating the solar system in general, and we'll be re- evaluating that, a little bit later on. so, most of what we know, about geologic time, comprises only about ten percent, of the entire history of the earth. that's, very very important. any questions about this, yes. i read that, uh the rock found in, on the moon? yes right right   that it hasn't been churning its surface? well partly, because we find very old, rocks on its surface, but also because it's so small, okay because it is so small, it is not able to sustain, um, convection in its interior, to be able to destroy, its original crust. so its original crust is, is still there, still preserved. and that is a topic that uh, we're going to address in detail, when we talk about the origin of the moon, uh in another few lectures. now, another topic i would like to bring up, uh which as i said a moment ago was very influential, in putting the Geologic Time Scale together, okay remember that in identifying recent life, middle life and early life, correlations were being made over very large distances. and, on the handout i gave you, the example i would like to use, is of sedimentary layers very much like the ones we drew in our cross sections over there, but in this case we are looking at northern Colorado. uh i found this convenient to show you because, an oil company went and drilled five holes, right here in northern Colorado, uh over a distance of about a hundred and fifty kilometers, they put in five different holes, and discovered the following. there's hole number one, they went all the way down to whatever that is um, a hundred meters or so, perhaps deeper than that, and they found, a sandstone layer there, they found a shale right there, and they found this uh, formation that i colored in yellow right there. then they moved about what uh thirty forty kilometers away, put another hole in the ground and discovered exactly the same relationships they had seen over here, and repeated that five times, and, you can see this uh, orange unit appears in all five holes, and the yellow unit likewise, appears in all five holes. does that bother anybody? that you can actually find a unit like a sandstone, shown in orange, over a distance of, a hundred and fifty, two hundred, perhaps even a thousand kilometers? the reason i ask you, wha- whether it bothers you or not is the following... okay this is something i've given you, as well. if you ever stood, at the waterfront at the beach, where sediment comes into a standing body of water like the ocean, you would be the first one to tell me, that right next to the beach here, um it is not a terribly wide zone over which we're depositing very coarse grains of sand and, pebbles and cobbles and so on. okay so, if we take a picture, that is an instant in time, what we'd discover, is that in areas where sediments are deposited, we have a very narrow zone over which coarse sediment is going to be deposited, and if we go in slightly deeper waters it's a very narrow zone over which sand is being deposited, and in deeper waters, a very narrow zone over which mud or mudstone eventually, is being deposited. so the question i'm asking you, is how do we go from, very local deposition, of sediments, in a zone that's no more than, a kilometer or so in width, to having such a unit actually cover an entire state. everybody see what the problem is here? okay the, oil wells that we just drilled in northern Colorado show us that a sandstone unit can actually exist all the way from the Utah border, to the Nebraska border. this is, a very very wide area, and yet when we look at environments in which sediments are being deposited today, we see that, any given unit like a sandstone or a conglomerate, is being deposited over just a very narrow belt and my question to you is, how do we go from, having sediments deposited in a very narrow area, to having that particular sediment cover, an entire state. how does that happen? con- conditions were different? uh, in what sense, it's gonna have to do with conditions yes you're right, as far as like, well, um conditions are changing, but in what way? Drew. um maybe it was all covered by ocean before. okay what did the ocean do? uh glaciers? what did the glaciers do? they carried sediments? uh, they're going to do it, locally okay they are going to do it locally. when we talk about, the sediments you find, in let's say the Grand Canyon, so, the different types of ro- uh rocks have been deposited  exactly, right what we deposit in any one location, is going to be a function of, how far we are from the shoreline, in other words, how high sea level happens to be, uh in that particular locality, okay? so, eventually, over geologic time, keep in mind that we're talking about millions and millions of years, you will build a transgressive sequence like the sediments we find, in the Grand Canyon today, that are not just, uh randomly distributed, but there is indeed a systematic order, to what you see, and that represents, sea level rising. now, this invites the other question, okay, uh of, if sediments are deposited during sea level drop, what order should they, exist in? as we look at a stratigraphic column, very much like this one, but, those sediments happen to have been deposited when sea level was going down, what order should they exist in? again it's something you can figure out by looking at uh, uh, uh a column li- or rather by looking at a cross section like this, okay now let's say, that, well let's begin with this unit right here. it's a shale, okay, where it is right there. if sea level drops, so that now sea level is right here, what's going to be deposited on top of the shale? sandstone it should be sandstone, right? because the water's going to be now relatively shallow, so that the environment here will be ideal for sandstone, and, uh if we drop sea level even further, what should be deposited on top of the sandstone? conglomerate it got eroded away? okay why? mm because uh, after the sea regressed it was exposed to the elements again and,  exactly, okay notice that, during transgression, the sediments being deposited, are immediately covered up by others, by younger sediments, so that there is a much better chance, of that section being preserved, in the geologic record, than it is if sea level is dropping. if sea level is dropping, the moment you deposit something like, this sand right in here, okay and then sea level went to down here, well, those loose sediments are immediately exposed, and they're going to be eroded away. so, regressive sequences are not very common in nature, because very shortly after, deposition, of the sediments, they're eroded away, simply eroded away. okay anybody, have a question about that? transgressions and regressions? so basically, sediments exist, as a unit, over very long distances, because of sea level transgression. and in fact i think uh, i give you a couple of examples to finish off here. uh one example is a modern, modern example of sea level transgression, which uh the Netherlands, are experiencing today. okay so i have a couple of cross sections here. on top we are looking at the North Sea, and, here is the Netherlands or Holland, right here, and you can see that uh, four thousand B-C or rather four hundred B-C so that this is a mere twenty-four hundred years ago, the shoreline was actually right here. in the Netherlands. and at the present time, the shoreline has moved to way over here, this is why the Dutch have to deal with these dikes, in order to keep sea level, uh from, inundating their land. okay the shoreline used to be there, now it has marched, all the way uh to here, and you can see that, in a place where, previously, sand was being deposited, that's what these little dots are, the water now is so deep, that mud, is what's being deposited, so on top of, sandstone, we are now having, uh shale being deposited. and when you go north of there, to the Scandinavian countries, uh you see exactly the opposite. okay, so let's see where was, uh sea level, at uh, let's see where does this go? six thousand B-C uh the shoreline, was way over here, okay and at the present time, the shoreline is right there. so it has actually, retreated, so in other words, sea level happens to be dropping in Scandanavia. how do we explain that? let's see if we have uh, a map to show the region we're talking about here. okay there is uh uh Great Britain, so the Netherlands would be, somewhere in here, and here is Scandanavia. so the area we're talking about is actually not very large right? uh Holland over here, Scandanavia over here we're saying that sea level, has gone up over here, sea level has gone down over here. how could that be? how could it be that sea level is doing two different things, not very far... from each other, those two localities. how could that be? different, rock formations. different rock formations? that  (we couldn't) why not?   there were glaciers okay, there were s- about three kilometers of ice, right where you're sitting. okay very very thick ice, and certainly, there was a tremendous amount of glaciation in the Scandinavian countries, and believe it or not, when you have several kilometers of ice sitting on top of the crust, it depresses the rocks. very much like putting a big chunk of rock on a sponge, okay the sponge, uh is depressed downwards. rocks, that form the crust can likewise, be depressed, and after the glaciation has gone away, uh Scandinavia happens to be rebounding, very much like a sponge, would rebound, and guess what happens to s- to uh Holland over here? when this rebounds, it's almost like, pulling on a handkerchief or a shirt, you can see that a moat has to build around, this topographic high, and okay so Scandinavia's going up, and all the area around Scandanavia, has to be going down. this is known as isostatic rebound, re-equilibration, 	1
LES565SU137.json	kay alright get that on tape, no have you_ oh you have started it okay. yeah, well th- it's in in a okay you're obviously reading MacKinnon? yes  okay pornography is, say that again please? um  forced sex sexual politics, yes and an institution of gender inequality. (xx)   that was on page uh four eighty-four but, one ninety-seven,  thanks. okay, pornography what is pornography? yes. um maybe like, sexual acts, um in an erotic manner i don't, i dunno. okay, in an, it's like sex that's, made to be viewed. sex that's made to be   yeah do you know what i'm getting at, by asking you that question right after, i put that definition up? yeah Eve. well i m- i think, Rachel meant like by the pub- the public not like, i mean are you   okay commercialized sex. yeah. yes? okay by what definition, Mustafa did you say, yes? uh by_ cuz there's naked women, okay okay um Playboy, it's it's not  okay soft pornish? like there's more hard-core porn like, isn't_ i don't, yeah w- okay okay um, Hustler, d- i- i haven't seen Hustler in a few years       right you know that i don't know i dunno. i've, never looked we actually bought one  i personally like don't buy the whole, like soft porn     okay okay so pl- um so you wouldn't n- necessarily draw a line then,  okay, okay um, i i would guess that it would be like sort of the insinuation,  okay    ah okay so a suggestive rather than blatant? yeah maybe. but i don't know if that's correct but that's how i, hear it. well i think there're lots of different definitions, of it um, let's see rather than, graphic, or than obvious... um, but we can come back to this and actually this is kind of alluded to in one of the readings for um Wednesday, um where when you read, um, some harlequin novels for example which one of the articles for Wednesday is about. they um, talk about how, the sexuality is is just insinuated or suggested, in a lotta the books Eve. well it's funny that she said insinuation cuz i was gonna say that like Playboy that it's insinuation of sex cuz it's like naked women that like make you think of, you know having sex or whatever, and if you consider that porn then like part of porn could just be insinuating like, sexual things, mhm ah okay. okay. con- okay um, so it's more consensual then or y- um, i mean i don't_ i just  um let's see. as opposed, um, Stephanie okay. oh no i'm   um    yeah okay  (more    okay     i have like a totally different idea um, yeah somebody else was, next good oh Mustafa yeah (xx) uh, i guess when i think of that, i think something that's more artistic, okay uhuh    yes okay yeah um, yeah sleazy like porn without the sleaze? maybe? um i always thought, erotica was more geared toward women,   mkay... mhm. like from a woman's point of view, or something? okay and stuff like harlequin and like Madonna and those kinda (things.) okay okay Whitney you had your, um, yeah i agree with, is it  okay. that's exactly what i thought of erotica more like whips and chains and like,   mhm  mhm  yeah  yeah i agree with, Debbie and Mustafa that it's, it may be more kinky but just  okay  mhm, okay. and i also do think it's more about women. okay. although it's interesting because some of the things that you're describing as maybe being erotica, it's hard to understand how they would appeal, to specifically to women like the the bloodletting. yeah yeah so, maybe that's a little, tenuous yeah? i was just gonna say i think that the, the mainstream, approach is not only, is not only, erotica usually gendered as, female and pornography      um, legitimize it? legitimize  um going along with the like geared towards men or which one is for which, it_ i just think the audience overall is broader for erotica, mhm huh    okay. okay um Kim? i was just gonna say, i think erotica is generally like more accepted like, um, you can see erotica much more in like the mainstream media than you would, i mean,   mhm, hm yeah um Leah and then Debbie again. i just have a question for people who see erotica as being considered more mainstream and accepted, like what's an example of erotica then? like cuz i_ like when i think of pornography, you know Playboy Hustler mhm    mhm  mhm  yeah   the usual,   more deviant? more more deviant more creative more, more, out of the ordinary, okay  mhm okay. um just a couple more and then actually we need to go on to what's obscene but yes let's go ahead  mhm mhm okay Corinne? i was just gonna_ to answer both of your questions at least from, what i've read on it i've always thought of pornography as kind of like, like i mean pornography like Hustler and Playboy like those kinds of things and erotica like, i don't know at least from my understanding would be more something like you'd see in like Maxim or like, mhm hm hm mhm okay Linda i think you were next and then Rachel, and then we stop. i think like one big distinction between um, erotica and pornography and this could probably explain why more like, males are, the audience of one versus the other and i think that like, erotica's focused a lot, on the arousal and like mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm  mhm toward this.   to go along with that i think that erotica's more like pleasure-seeking and pornography's more like an objectification,  okay so when you say focused on pleasure that includes the woman's?   yeah yeah i've heard of it but  erotica for pornography yeah that's what i would consider that too    it was their idea i'm sure. but but it objectified women in the same way that some pornos do like  mhm mhm okay uhuh mhm yeah Jim you're (next) i think that um, pornography is focused on pleasure too i   okay so you can't really make that  okay Leslie? i, flipped through the book and i think th- the difference probably is that, in a lot of pornography there's like, really close-up shots of like, genitalia. right. mhm  mhm mhm yes and by the way that's one definition of hard-core pornography is when they have like every little explicit detail and it's very very close up. um, but yeah that well, we'll come back to that too, that's just one more definition Molly do you wanna,  mhm okay, okay well let's_ yeah Eve. just to respond to that yes     mhm hm mhm   yeah okay mhm   or, or you could say, or you could_ but i mean at the same time you could say pornography's a type of erotica. okay    okay. well the point of_ anybody else, actually, with their, definitions? okay well the point of one o- well one of the points of my asking you guys this question is, number one i don't i- a couple of you said near the end i'm getting confused or i'm not sure what the definition really is. um i think there're lots of different definitions of both of these as Catherine MacKinnon pointed out in that article, um notice how much trouble like legislators have had in trying to define what pornography is and therefore maybe, legislate against like the obscene parts of it without, um curtailing free speech etcetera but yeah Molly do you wanna, i was actually just gonna say that i i heard on N-P-R this morning that, there's new federal legis- legislation for prisoners they can no longer have pornography, any um se- um, sexual explicit um acts of, well of sex, mhm okay oh mhm okay even between, like two women, i assume that would still be banned. uhuh  um i remember we discussed in our previous class about how pornography was seen sometimes as, um a way of treating_ i know this is like a refer back to like slavery, mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm. um yeah those kinds of of things in, like a magazine or whatever it would be hard to look at those and s- see those as erotica although maybe, maybe some people would yeah   mhm mhm mhm    mhm      yeah absolutely and i think Collins made that point as well um in talking about, some of these images yeah Leah did you have your hand up or? well i was just gonna say that i haven't really seen 'em but from what um i'm sorry Ann Ann was saying i think that um, (i think) it just per- just a second, it perpetuates the stereotypes it it ap- it appeals to the stereotypes that i think people, maybe are looking for you know how, people are attracted to a certain type of individual mhm  mhm. kay yeah Leslie. um it_ i think it also not only, um exploits like racial, stereotypes but i think it it, does like, it it is very ageist also like if you, yeah   mhm right mhm oh absolutely yes and in fact it's bu- it's interesting though because when you said ageist i was also thinking ageist in the other direction, um because who is it Farrah Fawcett, who posed for Playboy like at the age of, what? what is she like fifty or something? i don't remember. um but that was like a really big deal, um because you don't see too many fifty-year-old women in Playboy. um, and you don't see too much pornography of like older women unless that's like part of the story line (right) it involves wh- whatever story line they have or to what extent they have one yeah. yeah so no that's a good point. good. okay well let's go on to obscenity what's obscenity? what was the famous quote about obscenity? i know it when i see it    Paw Paw Paw Paw? Paw Paw Michigan i've never heard of it but okay, it's a  no no hm'm. yeah. can i erase this? yeah? we're gonna run outta room. well i was just gonna say she's arguing that there can't be any good porn because of how it's, only about like inequality and objectifying women and, um, you know, women at the submission of men and,    well, i don't know if this, Allison no no go ahead no    yeah wh- where mhm  yes yeah because sh- cuz one of the things, i- that MacKinnon is sometimes criticized about, i- as for example with Segal criticizing her, well what does Segal say about the connection between pornography and violence against women? what does Segal say about that? like how would she respond to this point of MacKinnon's? wouldn't she say it's not even proven? yeah she says it's not proven that the connection there is really tenuous we don't, we don't know if there's a real connection there. and in fact some of the evidence says there's not a connection there. um so, so one of the things that MacKinnon has sometimes been criticized for, is for making these kinds of connections without a whole lot of social scientific evidence, to back it up. but um, what Mac- how MacKinnon might answer that is, number one she's not only focusing on the direct connection between, okay men who read pornography are more likely to commit rape. she's making kind of a broader argument than that and it's actually the way, both Allison and Stephanie were talking about this men, treat women according to these pornographic images. so to MacKinnon it doesn't necessarily matter so much if the social scientific evidence, shows that you know men who read porn are are more likely to commit rape, um, because what she's saying is that it con- it contributes to, an atmosphere or a or an environment in which women are seen a_ in a particular way. and therefore treated, in that particular way. that's very damaging, according to MacKinnon yes. also on page one ninety-eight um, what page? mhm mhm mhm    mhm,  mhm... yes... um, which of th- yeah c- Corinne you wanna,      okay.  (no) false yeah false consciousness yeah. i think_ i can't remember if MacKinnon uses, um that term explicitly, um but it's definitely implied... that you know the women are, victims they're n- they are really have agency. and what about, um but she also talks about, where is this? lemme get my questions on this. there was one point in here, that i wanna bring up because it contrasts with Segal, very well. um... let's see... oh the last on on the questions, um that i gave you guys the last question on MacKennut MacKenna. or MacKinnon, sorry when she's talking about the problem of calling rape and pornography violence not sex. um and then she says no probably not probably not. um, but but what is it? or what does it represent? so women who are aroused by pornography, what does that say t- i mean it gi- so MacKinnon's not denying that that's the case sometimes, but what does she say about it...? women who are aroused by porn, mhm? i guess that it proves the theory that like, we've been socialized into these positions um yeah again that well you know maybe it's that's not unexpected, um in that in that given this society. given this society we shouldn't be surprised by this. but sh- but it's th- but she's not saying that it's a good thing  mhm  no i mean i think i think she i think she would say that like, i think i think there's l- i think there's like a an agreement in the sense that pornography, ca- is used and can be used to perpetuate a power, um, inequity. but that too just, completely like the whole thing about, it's_ isn't it odd that, some radical feminist theorists have the same social agenda as, r- mhm mm okay okay. um, yeah definitely she thinks feminists and right-wing activists, um working together, is a really weird combination. and not only a really weird combination a really bad combination. um... well i was gonna say i felt like MacKinnon was totally stressing that, pornography was all about women's inequality, mhm in what ways? uh that um, they feel more anxious because they can't measure up to, uhuh  no      mhm. yeah yeah men can't measure m- l- literally measure up to these, m- men, um in porn films, and maybe that's damaging to men, as well. um in what other ways, was it damaging to men? do you remember? oh yeah. well it was saying how um, there's a medicalization of like the male sexuality also like um, uh, i don't really know where to go with that but,  well i don't know what i gathered from (it) was maybe like um, with like Viagra   um, some men can think that they won't be able to satisfy   or that men seem to be, ready to have sex all the time. yeah  inadequate (inadequate) yeah inadequate insecure. also i gathered from it that they um, they were talking here about that like just like women's reactions, that they also feel guilt about secon- sex and they blame women for like, their source of their fantasies, okay whe- where are you? um i'm on page um, two thirty-two. and they seem like sexuality's imposed on them without, like projecting sexuality and, contrary onto women like, they feel_ that's what my gathering like they feel like they have to have these fantasies and they can't deviate from, oh so  okay    okay. bringing in another_  i guess this is in like, MacKinnon's comeback sort of for the um thing about, how it affects men badly, mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm okay. and say a little bit more about that. like, so a man feels that he can't measure up or he can't satisfy a woman, so he's like upset with the woman when she isn't satisfied and it's  mhm mhm you don't feel too sorry for the men. well i mean... just like overall with the whole like feminist like men theory like they're socialized the same way where there's things that come out, you know limiting  mhm mhm   okay mhm okay, okay. by the way i mean all of what you just said that would be really good for the response paper, because certainly a lot of what you're saying i think    in in response to that, um, i th- l- let's think back to like i_ god i don't even remember the article, way way way back like a month-and-a-half ago  mhm mhm mhm  mhm or pornography and that, like struggle for masculinity. i mean that's kind of just like a overall society thing you can't  mhm the thing is is though too is that, the range of, um like sexual possibility for, like the average straight man is far less than it is for, the average like, heterosexual woman. like  okay mhm mhm   hm okay.  okay mhm mm     i agree with that i just think that it's like... i feel like these um, ideals and, like standards for how sex should be and heterosexual sexuality should be, mhm mhm  sure  mhm     mhm right which was obviously o- i m- or also a key point remember when we were talking about, how to be a tomboy isn't that bad but to be a sissy is, but the irony there was what does anybody remember actually_ we talked about this in class. but yeah so it seems like girls have more agency like in school, but that's because they're not taken as seriously,  yeah yeah um, like the thing that we were saying is that like um, how when th- porn h- actually hurts guys, and like yet they still watch it, mhm mhm mhm mhm okay mhm okay. Rachel do you wanna respond to that at all? it's your thing_ you don't have to, (xx) okay. i just not about that but i wan- i i don't know if this um, is taking us where we wanna go but, mhm  right mhm mhm    okay for the feminists to join with the   mhm yeah mhm mhm  okay  right    okay mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm    mhm     no no i think it makes a lot of sense Ann do you wanna respond to that? um yeah i mean i really agree with what yo- with what Molly's saying but i think it's really interesting to look at it like, from the beginning like, um the difference between why right-wing activists oppose porn versus why feminists oppose porn. mhm  right  mhm right right mhm marriage   MacKinnon might, not care, i mean as long_ i mean she would she would just be happy that like, mhm mhm it's a means to an end, (xx) mhm yeah yeah i think it- y- for practical reasons well we have to have these kind of odd bedfellows. yeah um Corinne. um like my, i think my biggest problem with MacKinnon is just like, i feel like she has this overarching idea of like how sex is and like that just is, i don't know like i think that her, the fact that she doesn't see any agency in, mhm     mhm yes and one that she gets criticized about a lot like later on when we're talking about um rape, a lot of the same kinds of problems come up in her work. so yeah that's a good point Molly did you, i was just gonna say that i also think it just doesn't, it doesn't, lead women to accessing their sexualities more easily.    mhm  it's it's i think it has more_ i don't know if you remember the article we read about athletics the, MacKinnon's article about, mhm  mhm mhm  mhm, in the same way yeah no i think that's really good conne- especially connecting it to the article on athletics. but so what does that mean? so women can only have healthy female sexuality by themselves? can they ever have it with a male partner? according to MacKinnon? wh- what do you think? you don't have to answer that Molly Rachel you wanna, well this applies to what i was gonna say because everyone was saying they thought MacKinnon would say, maybe it's a good thing that feminists are joining up with right-wing activists because it's a means to an end regardless, mhm mhm mhm   mhm mhm mhm okay. um although actually she does um, she obviously is very much an admirer of Andrea Dworkin, um who is part of this feminist right-wing activist,   mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm Jim. (xx?) um, i just find it most interesting and like this is the reason, uh also like with, um Gayle Rubin who wrote Thinking Sex  mhm    right mhm mhm mhm   yeah through legislation or whatever mhm mhm mhm  mhm mhm. yeah Molly? i was going to add on to that and i think i think why pornography gets such a bad rap and there's so much anti-pornography, um activism out there, is because it's so blatant, the um, the, power inequality mhm mhm mhm  mhm mhm mhm  mhm  mhm okay (it's problematic)  uh, just to kinda go along with that i think that, another problem i have with MacKinnon is i think she just kinda, makes these sweeping generalizations about pornography and kinda like takes away from, individual experiences of women     mhm. yeah Jim before i i get to you yeah just one point connected to that when we were talking about, the whole issue of agency and all that_ have any of you guys s- seen that uh magazine Mar- Marie Clare, i think it's called? okay when i was um flying down to Florida, a couple weeks ago, i was in_ i had a long layover in Memphis and i went and bought this magazine just cuz it, sounded like it was going to be fun and it was but anyway, they had this sex quiz in there that was_ i meant to actually copy it and bring it to class today. because one of the questions in there, ( i don't know) i just loved that idea yeah i was just gonna say also the way they phrase that question like, i know from like Seventeen magazine when you take all those quizzes like when i was younger i used to like, be really into that  mhm right yeah i i ca- to be honest i don't remember exactly how it was worded i will bring it in for Wednesday cuz it is um, i guess i don't remember whether it was is or can be. um but you're right that could make a difference. but um, but Jim what were you going to say? we only have a, a couple minutes left. well this'll give everyone a laugh. um, mhm  mhm uhuh Bend Over Boyfriends. or Bend Over Boyfriends, thank you. there's a Bend Over Boyfriends Two too. yeah. kay   okay. okay okay oh these right. i've i've nev-   subversive it is subversive mhm  okay okay yeah actually_ i'm sorry Molly we're re- just about out of time but actually this is something we're gonna be talking about on Wednesday so if, you remember what you were going to say on Wednesday bring it up then. unfortunately we got through two out of five articles, as usual, so on um Wednesday_ actually i think we're gonna skip the Dines altogether i think i told you you guys could just skim that one, but definitely review Collins and um, and Hooks again i r- i really wish we'd gotten to them today, and then the other two that are specifically for Wednesday that are more about women's agency etcetera. okay great i'll see you then. 	1
OFC195SU116.json	so, who came here first? i don't know, um, you wanna start, do you have a question?     um, everyone  (Robin?) yeah, i have a question, (xx) okay this, right here i'm not sure_ i don't understand why we use this,  shape factor (xx) you use the shape factor when you don't know like when you have two dimensional heat transfer right? okay which is the case here because you know like (heat) is going this way, it's radially going out  mhm mhm but if that's_ this shape factor is it says it's for, hollow cyl- cylinder. um  yeah because this is for, no this is for buried, buried cylinder. for a hollow cylinder it's the same thing except you have R-two, except  okay uhuh   right. this is like the internal resistance, the convection resistance inside the pipe and this is for the thickness of the pipe itself. and then, from here to here the shape factor takes care of it. and you need to_ if you want to add the resistances you have to convert the shape factor into a resistance first which is one over K-S just like this. okay? so this is the shape factor, this is the Q for it, and this is the resistance for it. and it takes care of (heat) transfer from here to here.    if it's if it's a very small thickness and if the material is very conductive, then you can probably say that the resistance is very small because this is, this delta-R is really, small and this K is very big so this resistance is very small you neglect it in favor of the other one. so usually when you have thick, i mean thin, layer you can tell you can say that the resistance is very small it has to be very conductive too. you can't really say only by, the delta-R because if this thing is very small too then, okay  so there's jus- just one more question (xx) one more question like mhm right yeah yeah you should  okay now there's another box here, and there's another pipe in it.  uhuh is this solid right here? yeah  okay  okay Nusselt number, and would the Nusselt number be the same for these two or  okay. i mean w- the velocities are different so you have to first check if they're in the same regime you might be able to use the same formula for them, if the re- regime is the same  oh okay. if they just give you a Nusselt number a value for Nusselt number  yeah if they  um yeah but they, they probably won't give you a number for Nusselt number you know they won't say like Nusselt number is ten. okay they just give you a velocity and you should be able to calculate the Nusselt number yourself, using the formulas for for (inside  okay okay? okay great. thank you. okay. next. do you have a question? i'll, i'll go after them. okay alright i just had a few, uh, conceptual things (here.) (alright) yes if it's_ if it falls in the chart if it's falls in this   okay great.  yeah you do? okay, cool. yeah so, a- another thing (i was confused on) is that i know, you talked about this before and i don't_ i wanna make sure i have it right, now if you um_ because the one equation for, um, case two,  mhm yeah correct okay so you can  okay okay? as long as the thickness of the pipe is not really big you can use L-C because, um, as we said before yeah and that's case one. if it's not really insulated, we correct the length by saying we cut this in half add half of it to this side add half of it to this side, so this is just a little bit longer, right? mhm so if this thickness is not very big now, this correction won't make too much of an error yeah right? in the, actual case. but if this thickness is big you need to use the formula for case two which is the exact formula for,  um, and then uh, oh for semi-infinite, um... so, i was just uh curious is tha- is this exponential is that, all of this    yeah i was thinking (xx) right this if you know the surface temperature. y- yeah if you know yeah if you know the surface temperature you can use this, this is probably in terms of H so you know the heat transfer coefficient outside and the temperature outside. okay? well this is saying it's, T-one (and then this) (xx) is T-one? yeah T-one is in the fluid, it's not the surface temperature right? yeah, so, you can use this chart when you have fluid temperature? right.  um  yeah but i i j- if i read the notes right it's just you need to know that this     okay okay, um, i think that was basically it,  so when do we use this equation then? which one? only if you know the surface temperature? um see if it's, only_ if if you know the surface temperature it's only the first term that you need to, deal with, okay? if you ne- if you know the surface temperature and that's in your notes it's right  yes okay, and so, what_ i mean like you use this if you know the, s- the surface temperature (xx) (now where does T-S come from?) um T-one would be T-S then. but i thought this (was) T-S  okay if the X is ex- extremely large, or the H, the exponential of, this minus this thing you know like  so surfa- temp- surface temperature would be T-one right? surface temperature would be T-one yes. and then you would just solve it  in his uh wi- uhh on his exam notes, he does (have the small) (xx) does it? yeah, okay   yeah and he he showed the, (cases about.) right. so he just switched the T-S to T-one over the, yeah right? so if you know the surface temperature you can use that (xx) but, th- and then wouldn't you use this (part) if you know H? yes okay. this one, you can use if it you don't know H? no if you don't know H how do you use this one? i don't_ i don't know why would you use this one? why  so if you don't know H you can still (use this)  no but i said if, if you know the surface temperature, and you don't know H you can (do the same?) you don't know surface temperature but_ and you know H? no you know the surface temperature but you don't know H. you know the surface temperature and you don't know H you can use only this part. yeah and that's not as accurate, right? it is it is very accurate.  okay how're you gonna find (these?) i mean how are you gonna solve for T if you don't know H? no no, if they give it to you. if they give you like the surface_ they say like you have a semi-infinite solid initially at this, temperature at, like T-naught. and then at time T equals zero you set the surface temperature to be T-S and you keep it at T-S, how the heat, diffuses in, then you know T-S right? you know the surface temperature.  that's gonna be, T-one right? T-S is going to T-one. right yeah   for your what? the T T is what you wanna solve for. yeah  if you don't know H, you said you kno- you don't   term right. alright yeah oh just uh one quick_ i know you use alpha in this equation, uh, is rho a solid? is the K a solid?   for, w- whichever material you're talking about but_ right in these equations it's for solid. okay in Prandtl it's for liquid, oh, yeah for fluid  okay. so in this one (is just_) everything is for solid. okay yeah,   uhuh no no you have, two different cases.   okay   if you know H you don't know (xx)   for each, for for the five, first five seconds you use the H for, oh okay  you have to check the Biot number for both cases,  yes   okay  and then, we want, we wanna graph the temperature naught, the theta over theta-naught right? no you wanna, plot the the temperature itself. okay and is this, is this, equal theta over theta-naught or is this just theta? no that's theta over_ well it depen- depends on how you define your theta.   yeah, because som- usually how they define theta is, a nondimensionalized thing so it's actually this whole thing  right uh,   okay so we wanna actually solve it for T? yes okay correct and then, on the third one, uhuh  mhm mhm right     yeah so, let's say if we knew that temperature if you could evaluate the film temperature, and you could do all our (xx) calculations right? yeah so what if guess on, guess just the temperature for the walls, evaluate our film temperature, and get our physical properties, and then calculate an H, okay? okay and because we know we can calculate Nusselt numbers mhm yeah because it's   okay? so first guess, first just guess a, wall temperature in order to evaluate your physical properties and then just, don't worry about that, guessing, okay? just first guess one, get your physical properties, okay? and then calculate your H, and then calculate your temperature of the wall, of the plate. this won't be run? you don't have to iterate? y- then      yes okay okay but if you're smart enough you can, you can guess a value which is, close.  uhuh right don't guess like zero.  alright,  okay it should get you there in two iterations or something. it shouldn't take,  alright    okay okay? right,   this i (am) still doing this. okay  okay i mean i've done it (four times and then) thi- this is correct. it's cool? okay   okay you know? lemme just make sure this is right then. okay cool (should be right now. plus,) question one i did it_ i think an easier way you said you_ we should use like a, homogeneous (anaparticular) solution  right   right, yeah, okay so you move that down here, yes and this integrates relative to that and you have like a natural log (xx) uh that's not then the homogeneous solution, right? that's that's solving al- everything all together   no no   yeah right so okay yeah just don't make a mistake. solving solving the homogeneous part and then adding the particular solution is easier. okay maybe if i have time this weekend i'll do that. okay  (i have a) question (xx) right um, this is correct right? to find a particular solution? yes you say that it's (xx)  okay, but then the final_ (this is) probably_ i'm hoping that it's right like you just solve for C, C-one,  okay  yes yes okay and then you solve for C-one. correct okay and yeah, shou- i mean your  okay okay thanks i just have (xx) question in two now, with what you said and that, what i did was i just, what'd i do? i first, i got all the properties_ i can just write on this. i got all this and i calculated a Reynolds number and from that you can use this correlation to get the Reynolds_ or the Nusselt number. correct  right right correct. you're talking about the solid. you're talking about the temperature's trajectory of the    for H. exactly. H is for fluid around it, everything else is for solid. okay and, that's that's a (pretty small T let's see) does it matter that the air's going this way or this way? does it no. doesn't  no, it doesn't matter. it's just flow, past a cylinder, right okay well, i don't know like but my plot was something like that i don't know if that's okay you're i know what you're doing probably. oh wait. this is time no it's not, it should s- it should start going off really fast  uh this is for the heating cycle. this is for heating cycle, yeah so H is like forty-two H is pretty big and then you don't have much of internal resistance so it should go up very fast. oh   you're probably the way the way you plugged the formula  uhuh uh probably you're just plugging in the formula wrong because, everything is right here. um i mean you're_ you have the right formula (to combine that) so you should be able to use the (sample) (xx) okay  i don't even know if that's the formula (or not) well okay just to make sure you put the right formula. it's H-A over rho-C-P-V, times T. it's H-A over rho-C-P-V times T. the whole thing times T.  okay.   do you  doesn't  oh you can you can put it in but it's the same thing. like it gives you, it gives you pretty much the same answer     yeah okay okay? (xx) okay, that's, all. (xx) those are the surface area of the fin. they are? then what is the face area of the fin? that's the cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer. so when, so, so when is (sh- he) using this? when you say Q is minus-K-A D-T-D-X, that A is the cross-sectional area. perpendicular to the direction of heat  um, no. probably, might be an M. (is it um) in in the C like this is like the same equation but except this is H-A and this    yes actually this is easier.  yeah cross-sectional because whenever you talk about conduction it's minus-K times A D-T-D-X right? and that A is the area, perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer right? mhm (alright?) so that that's the area that that's how it comes in the picture. uh,  well you had the temperature profile and you took a derivative of it. right? well w- wait the Biot number, is   right so using this would probably (use them here?) that'll be easier right. okay yeah alright. kay so, let's go on with your questions. you came first  yeah,  okay i think i know how to do it but, like i didn't_ i'm not sure i'm like setting it up right, mhm   correct so i was thinking, you wanna guess this temperature right? yes calculate the why do you wanna guess the temperature? so you can calculate you wanna calculate you don't know the H, the heat transfer coefficient  right? correct so, you wanna guess that so you can calculate G-F to evaluate the properties, to, you know do the Nusselt stuff to calculate H-all? or am i doing this wrong? no that that's correct.   okay. okay, and then you wanna calculate, the, Q through here so then you can go back and recalculate this, correct to make sure it's right. yes so, but the question i was having is, you can either calculate Q like this, like being convected from this, or Q through here right? they'll be the same thing. do you think they'll be the same thing? won't they? well i'm just asking. yes yes, it's  right yeah. okay okay so it doesn't matter if you if you calculate it either way. right. and the other thing is, you don't actually need this temperature  right  inside of the insulation no you don't need it  yeah  okay, so i understand that, so i kinda_ yeah it's just setting it up that kind of confuses me, like what what to guess first and how to proceed you mean? ye- well i kind of, made just like a reason that it would be closer you know to this obviously than this and, i kind of (been) more confused on the second part how, it's the same, it's the same idea for the second part right? yes except you're gonna guess three temperatures. which are, which temperatures? the temperature_ like th- if this is the inside of the insulation the temperature on the inside of the insulation inside of the window and the outside of the window. so outside of the insulation you mean. not inside of the insulation. yeah,  in between the space. correct   mhm so, you guess the three temperatures but, what you can calculate all three in one step, right? in each step of your iteration you can calculate all three different temperatures. because if you know the Q, right? you can jump from, the inside of the room to the outside of the, um plastic, and calculate this temperature. and the with the same Q you can jump from here to here, you know to the inside of the window and calculate the temperature of the inside of the window with the same Q you can, jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the window, so all three temperatures can be  yeah right? yes so it's basically the same thing as part A it's just like three different temperatures that you have to guess. and as long as you guess them, you know like physically they're close to, what they're really    no i think it should converge in like couldn't you    um circular   yes you can do that yeah. okay right so, like you calculate the temperatures and then the temperatures that you calculate here you say these cells are  no i have no idea. okay. you guess_ you have three cells for the temperatures right?  two three. so this is like T-one T-two T T-three and then you go on and you calculate these three. okay? mhm don't put these three in the same cells put 'em in the next row.  yeah because this way you know like you're referencing something to to itself it's not good because, sometimes Excel, gets  okay? um, okay then the only other, thing that, i have a question on, for the second part, is, do we do i wanna like go about it with the same steps like first calculate, this H, to calculate, you know, see i- it doesn't make as much sense to me there i guess. why? tell me what your thought process is. well cuz i know that you you don't_ for the second part you don't need this H_ you need this H and you need this H right? correct to calculate, the Q. yes     yes yes. so what's the problem? oh okay. i see what you're saying. it's ju- but i'm just, yeah  no i just don't understand like what sh- i should go about doing first. you just guess three temperatures you know all your Hs right? if you guess the three temperatures,    yeah yes, yes, okay does that make sense? yeah no it makes sense i just, you know i'm thinking, like doing, i'm th- still thinking about it like one at a time like do this one, and then calculate this to recalculate  mhm right? you can't just jump from here to here because, first of all, um,  yeah, they all  okay okay? but it makes sense if i do that for the first part. yes, because, for the first part you can jump from the inside of the room to here right away. but, in the second part if you want to jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the window, on your way there's an H that you don't know so you can't calculate a resistance for this part. unless you know these temperatures wh- which you guess. okay okay? mhm so just start, start working on it it'll make more sense to you, once you  no no on_ for on for the second part  okay i have um  what? you should stay. yep we need, words here. (unless you use_) we use, we use bad words. uh, for the first one um, i know it's like flow through a pipe but, you need to know what regime you're in don't you? yes you need to_ so, to do that you need to calculate your Reynolds number? correct um, do you, do you need a rho? or you need a rho for what? a density o- of, rho of the oil flowing through the pipe? hmm hmm hm hm is there a way to get around that? did we not give it to you? okay we didn't give it to you okay but, um what is rho-V? oh um, if you have, mass (xx) (Q) oh it's just mass? rho times V no V meaning  yeah oh K-G per area right so you can multiply that by, it's kilogram per second per area right? yeah so it's like a mass flux.    so the mass flux so it means tha- i- if you know the mass flow rate, and you know the area you can calculate that, right? oh yeah that's right okay. okay?   yeah i can, i can play around with the units and (figure that out.)  see that's_ yeah, so that's, that's the mass flux going in here. mhm mhm  alright  okay okay? um, for the second one i thought i knew how to do it but, there's nothing that we applied, like that we learned, recently right? there's no natural convection or anything? no there's no  and then can you assume that the, ice is, zero degrees or the bulk of ice?   well actually you're only, you're only worrying about the surface of the ice right? mhm and the surface eye- of the ice which_ i- it's melting right? mhm so it has to be at  right? and the other thing is though, did you_ okay so, your solution scheme is right, but, once you start doing it you'll realize that there are some other things that you need to worry about. (alright) no not yet okay so,  yes  okay. well i haven't, i haven't tried it yet so i don't know if i okay so, um, your_ you want to model this as a flow over flat plate   just go ahead and do it and and you'll probably a- ha- have some more questions  okay okay thank you. sure... um, this one was Regina's right? i think she left  okay i think i  yeah,   so it's, kilograms per meters squared per second? yeah, so it's kilograms per meters squared per second it means that it's like a mass flux right? mhm because flux is, quantity per unit time per unit area. mhm mhm  and you know the area that it's going through,  mhm  well rho-V itself is, yeah  mm... no,   you know the rho-V,   i need to talk to the uh, advisor himself.   huh? how how long you gonna be here? i'm gonna be here until one-thirty. ah why? i was just gonna see if you wanted to go eat.  you do? i have office hours i can't. i guess so can't leave this room. you can't leave? come on no alright okay have fun have fun, bon appetit kay what, what Reynolds numbers am i looki- i mean, i found_ i mean like the only ones i s- ever saw were like, these i mean, these ones the Reynolds numbers? what, what do you mean like the formula for Reynolds number? like is it just like a regular Reynolds number? yeah  okay so it's just rho-V-D kay over mu... and that's for the, i mean you're using_ i guess this_ like it has a like a film temperature or a bulk temperature it's a bulk temperature   pipe um you don't need to worry about the film temperature it's all  mhm okay  i think i was using the  hey Ali. how's it going? pretty good. how're you? good. okay so what's up? uh, for the first two i'm checking if i did it right, okay and the third one i was gonna, ask for some advice. mhm okay, mhm and so then you can find an H. yes so then, you just set the Q equations equal to each other, um the Q equations  um  okay yeah what delta-T are you using here and what delta-T are you   yeah to the bulk  exactly okay okay great yeah i i suppose i should, define that a little better  is the, inlet  yeah i think it's a little bit, low. oh yeah? i'm not sure but  it can't go much higher though cuz it's only seventy-seven. well, this seventy-seven is supposed to be the average, somehow, you know like, the average of the bulk temperature. oh  okay  oh because, like when i take a delta-T, of uh, when i have a like, this delta-T, is that from ninety-eight, not to seventy-seven cuz that's bulk? is that where i'm doing it wrong? no i think that's right. okay okay it   mhm   yeah your method is right and i don't know the final answer but it should be around ninety degrees Celsius because, um, that's why we gave you this average. oh mhm and we give it to you at seventy-seven so it should be, around ninety.   okay okay now the second one okay and then i'm gonna listen in and yeah, okay um rho-L-W okay, um L-W D-T right yeah   um the ice correct yeah okay. okay so then i, um i said okay i foun- first i have to find a Reynolds number to do, figure out what region i'm in.   mean length between where and where? because i_ because it's not square, so i wasn't sure so i said, it's gonna be the average of these two, that's what L would be, because it's point-five, kilometers by,  no but when we were talking about flow over a flat plate, the L that we're using is just, in the direction of flow. we don't care how wide it is  yeah we only, care how long it is. so the L should be the length,  yeah, if you're modeling it as a flow over flat plate. okay. well then i can change that but, i don't think it will change it that much so then i just found, i found that (as in) turbulent and i think it'd still be if i used a thousand. yeah because it's even higher right? yeah oh yeah because L is even  okay  correct mhm okay, and is this an average H or a local H? it'd be average. okay i think, the equation right. now, that thing_ you remember we talked about this in the class, that this is for the case where, all of your heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime. oh,  oh mhm oh okay  do you, kinda, do you use like a what a (level ruler or covar) or like because y- you know a set length's gonna be in laminar and a set's gonna be in turbulent, yes so then you take the average, like they're weighted, or something     (get) another sheet here uh yeah just (xx) yeah oh well i can find some more paper here, just (take this one off)  mhm mhm now, the way we wanna do it here we want to break this, because we have two different equations for i- local heat   okay and   yeah okay yeah this one is, the laminar one is just, point-three-three-two, Reynolds to the one half, Prandtl to the one-thirds, mhm  okay but you know, first of all this thing you know when you integrate it what kind of, um what kind of a constant it gives you here because it's done for you right?  oh yeah yeah so this one you're all set, you jus- you know this point-six-six-four Reynolds, to the one-half and this Reynolds is at X-C,  mhm oh yeah, yeah because that's where it becomes turbulent  mhm (constant) yeah oh mhm so what will happen if you calculate from X-C to L? just think about it's very    oh oh oh you know, you d- you have to, you have to think about how X comes into picture in an in, heat transfer coefficient it's only through Reynolds right? oh mhm oh     mm yeah because lower limit is zero. if the lower limit is not zero, what would you get? think about it a little bit  yeah um,  yeah for_    okay then let's get, okay um hi Sarah. hi Ali. okay so  so (do you h-) do you wanna sit? yeah, okay so the first part's pretty easy i th- ess- you just add up resistances right? you add up resistances from where to where? you assume you start somewhere (under) rho, and you're given an H for the air, and you're given a K for the glass. mhm  mhm it'd be, sixty-five minus zero right? if you want to put sixty-five minus zero you have to go from, inside all the way to the outside. you're going only to the  so this temperature difference will be the f- from the surface of the glass to the, inside of the   surface of the glass on the outside? yes. mkay    no. which gap? after you put (the) in the  oh no no no okay first it's like, right and we're we're only talking about part A yo- we haven't put the plastic insulation yet. okay? okay so, um, th- doing doing it the same way you can you can talk about this, you can say that Q is delta-two over R. R being this but then delta-T is from the inside of the room to the outside surface of the, window. the temperature of which we don't know. okay  yeah  you just have to, add a, natural convection  mhm mm yeah because it, it's it depends on the delta-T that you have, between the vertical plate and the bulk       we can calculate the Q. now, once we calculate the Q, we can say, that same Q goes from the inside, to the right surface, through the outside of this, which is this formula. mhm right and check your T and if it's not the same T then you do it all over  so the first the first Q you calculate is just from the outside glass, to the outside, air, from like here to here using natural convection? you can do that you can do that if you want you can jump from here to here you can you can do whichever you want because the Q is the same.  right so you have the same Q you can either go from here to here you_ or you can go from here to here. right but the H you calculate from natural convection is just from here, to here right? right, yeah   okay? okay okay um so, for part B, do you treat, if you have air that's like, in the gap, and  no you won't have an H.  uhuh right it starts circulating probably.      okay so that   oh that's how you get your, that's that's like the air between two plates then? exactly. yeah. okay  so it's like the same thing that you  oh okay and it was circulating so your characteristic dimension would be the, gap   and then, the length is how, tall the window, is? yes. oh i forgot (xx) so thi- this part, you know the gap part is exactly the same as, what he, um, solved for you in the lecture. right  right the delta characteristic right? we called it delta (xx) oh okay okay so you have that thing too it's just like a, whatever i mean the gra- the normal gap that you would have and you have air circulating in it, that  mhm so you can calculate that too, um so once again you don't know, so once again you have to do natural convection, again get the Q, cuz you still don't know the temperature. right you_ there are several things that you don't know in part B, let's draw  yeah i'm writing on the newspaper, okay. um let's draw a picture this is the window, and this is the, plastic okay? so we have this fan here, we know H here, now we know_ we don't know this temperature we don't know this temperature we don't know this temperature right right? so we don't know anything. but let's say, first of all do we need this temperature or not? this one, inside of the plastic. i don't think so. 'm'm we really don't need it. the temperatures that we need are these ones because we need them for the natural convection, right? so, we need this this and this. right so, there are three different temperatures that we don't know but let's let's, see if we guess them, okay, let's see if we if we guess the three temperatures can we calculate them all at_ all in one iteration step or not? okay? okay so let's say we call this T-one we call this T-two and we call this T-three right?   if we know these temperatures we can calculate this H and this H right? mhm because they're just natural convection they only depend on the delta-T and the characteristics here and the, right  uhuh mhm yes because you know this temperature in,  (okay)  right  right   okay okay? and using a spreadsheet is much easier because you just put the formulas in you can say okay whatever H you calculated for here, put it in this formula for you know like resistances in series, go from here to here calculate this go from here to here calculate this go from here to here, calculate this, mhm oh okay okay okay?  yeah oh yeah you're happy now. no you're not happy now? it's okay, that's good well you started late you're not gonna be finished by Christmas. alright cool thank you Ali. sure, no problem. so did you think about that? well i was trying to think about both   think about that one. did you think about it Rosabel? i didn't hear that much of what he was saying. this is this and this is, so oh  awesome right? yes   exactly that's that's great. that's great it's not very obvious, where you say duh, it's not very obvious.  so we'll just rearrange  so did you come first or did Renna? well Renna is busy now i h- i heard what you were just saying. i totally, understood i was over here but i understand except, why was there only two, three T-thr- or three Ts unknown? uh no there're four Ts  no yeah because it depends on delta-Ts. but this natur- this convection uh coefficient you already have it so you don't even need this T.  so, you_ there're four Ts that that're unknown but you that_ there's one of them that is of no use so we just like disregard that one we guess these three... okay? okay and once you guess them you can calculate the Hs here and here and calculate the Qs and then recalculate the Ts from the Qs right? okay is this one just gonna be um, (H-al-) that'll just be natural convection,  for vertical plate, this one is natural  yes. yeah. correct okay. okay? yeah i have one other question. sure,  um lemme see what exactly you did you're saying energy over time is, Q over A  yeah okay so if you divide that flux by area  so you don't wanna do this. now i didn't really mean that. okay cuz i haven't  mhm will be Q. if this Q is the flux, then you need energy over area over time, to have the flux, right? okay correct? yeah. okay so but let's, i- wha- these are just um, these are just dimensions that we want to um, lemme just, alright? these are just um, dimensions that you want to correct but let's see what your solution scheme is, what you want to do l- next. um let's say you correct this,  mhm yeah okay, that's correct. where do you want to get this E from though? you wanna get it from here. um  i guess you should. okay yeah. so, you're saying that, okay dra- show me where the conduction is from, where  yeah, the energy goes through the_ yeah through resistance for the convection and then gets to the surface and that's  yeah   mhm yeah i wasn't sure because i know that they're traveling together so i thought,  i would natural convection is um, okay natural convection is when the, if this thing were,  but it's not it's not it's moving.  so then the water would be moving   then that looks like flow, past a, flat plate. exactly. exactly. so it looks like flow over, over a flat plate. yeah  okay thanks Ali. sure hey i did have that down.  um, cuz i wasn't sure. okay cuz i- yeah, i knew that only one of 'em was moving and i thought but, mhm  'm'm okay yeah okay? alright that was all? mhm okay,  mhm. don't worry Ali i don't have questions. you don't? i just came to try and do homework. okay. you just like this place huh? RESTRICTED oh you're doing separations? i think i'm doing (alright) now (xx) what you're trying to do here, or um you get the Reynolds number and see if it's laminar and then you're saying you have a Nusselt number equation yup that's fine. okay mhm thank you. sure RESTRICTED what? that's um they're just recording this for, some study. it's a project for the language insti- institute, and RESTRICTED no that's  yeah can i borrow it for a sec? mhm i gave mine away, but i have to give (xx) week, to the graders. Connor i'd rather get an ass-kicking than help you out. yeah yeah, i know... that might just be the case if you don't just give me that paper. you're horrible.  Elise you're working on heat and mass right? Ravi you got half an hour. go go. RESTRICTED dude i worked on that homework yesterday from like six o'clock until like midnight. like draw- with my ruler like drawing little lines, i was just_ yeah. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED it's like the most inaccurate method, to determine anything. wha- what method is that? it's um, we're we're doing multistage batch distillation, right thanks at a certain um, mole fraction a certain purity,   right  um, what you have is, you graph one over X-D minus X-W where this is the mole fraction of the distillate    yeah um trapezoidal is always better,  i use the trapezoidal. but then like i mean, i like had to estimate cuz i didn't wanna just use like the values that we had cuz that'd only be like two or three values, so i like estimated points on the graph you know, it's just like, you know everyone's values are gonna like, range all over the    really well there was another one too we had to graph, okay this is the Y equals X line this is the equilibrium line, correct we had to graph lines of constant reflux ratio so line of constant slope, at different X-Ds, uhuh  right   and then like, but to, to generate a graph, that's um, that looks like this so we have points on this side and on this side, you have to draw a line starting almost at one. yeah, yeah  yeah, that's engineering. yeah um, it kinda makes you wonder. RESTRICTED okay. good RESTRICTED hm? RESTRICTED for whi- for which one? let's see what you have. what're you listening to? uh i don't even know actually, W-C-B-N. oh W-C-B-N oh okay (i gotta find everything.) mhm yes alright okay. correct and then do you need to take into account, the heat transfer coefficient of the condensing steam or is that irrelevant? um for the steam you mean for the steam outside of the pipe? yeah no no you don't need that. don't need that because, because we're given the temperature inside the pipe right? the temperature of the wall just right inside the, mhm  okay so you just need the heat transfer coefficient for the inside? okay. correct okay, and then after you find the heat transfer coefficient, um do we know a relationship to find like, the temperature like along the, uh length of the pipe? you mean a temperature okay a fun- um   okay  no you don't um you don't need it and you don't have an equation for that. okay  because i thought it would be changing like along the whole length of    mhm you want to use this equation  the change i guess will come in through the, the bulk.  okay, but what we gave you is um,  average, right we say okay we give you a temperature and we say like these physical properties are given at that temperature  oh okay and this temperature is actually average temperature of the bulk. so, um, but you don't know it yet because you don't know the ou- outlet temperature right? mhm but it is actually the average temperature of the bulk so that's the  right is the average temperature of the bulk   okay. okay. so you only need to know, inlet and outlet, okay? yeah alright. cool. so just put those physical properties in here and get the H,  mkay cool thanks. mhm oh hey Brandon? yeah i just thought of something. for part A, on number two, did you get the an- get answers that match the ones in the book? um... oh for the_ you mean for number one, part A? or oh yeah i'm sorry number one. actually no but i put down the ones that were in the book. but they're pretty close i got like, (i got) like point-four-oh-five and i got, point-three-nine-five. i thought the answer was like point-eight-seven-five or something like that. oh, i wa- i was, i was talking for the, the liquid, the leftover. mm mhm yeah okay, maybe that's why my  i just remember my answers didn't match up exactly... i got point-three-five, uhuh  mhm... i can tell you what i got, i i think it's don't worry about. it's not like i'm gonna go back and change anything  wait a minute, so, okay so once you find H, mhm  um, so yes and this is the properties at, uh ninety-eight i think? yes ninety-eight. right, so um once you get the H,    right the area's gonna be... (xx) maybe sur- surface area, yeah the inner surface area  okay so you have this this too, now this is what T where? wall at wall right minus T um, i guess that'd be, that'd be T outside or, i don't know. (xx) that would be, the temperature of, the bulk. right temperature of the bulk, correct? mhm so, this is what, this is something you don't know yet  so this seventy-seven degrees is th- like the T-bulk that we're assuming for the physical properties but it's not necessarily the temperature coming out. no okay. no it's not.  mhm  right th- the change in Q? umm it's not a change in Q it's just a change in temperature. change in temperature it's the same Q, just raises the temperature of the oil right? right so the, thing that's raising the temperature of the oil would be the, condensing the steam right?  right bu- it's the condensing the steam, it's it's the condensation of the steam but we don't care about that    mhm okay so how do you say, Q is equal to, um, the increase in the temperature of the oil times something? increase in temperature of the oil (xx) if you give energy to some system it_ the temperature increases right?  increase in temperature, would it_ wouldn't be through conduction would it?  the the conduction because this is convective yeah this is convective     mhm mm would it be like, accumulated uh, generation? correc- no it's not generation. it's not generation. generation is only when you have reaction. right okay so it'd be, amount leaving equals, accumulation. accumulation right. okay it was uh, C-P exactly times delta-T times, yeah exactly. okay wasn't it C-P is in terms of let's say joules per it wasn't D-T was it? D-T, D-T you mean temperature? (in) time uh no, no, we want to_ okay let's look at the units. okay  so we just do the mass? yeah,  so multiply by mass so it's M-C-P delta-T. okay and if you want to have it in terms of, joules per second you should have M-dot then. right? because this thing is just joules per second    that would be from, this is for the oil? yeah. we say we_ as it as it goes in we give it this much energy so it re- it increases its temperature this much from where to where? from sixty degrees to, where the T outlet is. exactly, exactly, from inlet to outlet. so this delta-T is from inlet to outlet, and this delta-T is just wall minus bulk. mkay  mkay it's the    okay so, um, so, in, in this equation you don't care what Q is but you have H you have A you have T-wall, you don't know T-bulk average because you don't know the outlet, mhm okay right? alright mhm cool kay so i have a quick question on  yeah,  yeah outlet so it's temperature bulk outlet, so this is what that delta-T is, and this delta-T is basically this, from, equation right there right?   yep, that's all you need. okay. you have a question? RESTRICTED okay so what happened? we,   yes okay now we're just checking, um, the L will be, for like laminar, wouldn't it be zero to X-C,  you're getting actually one N- Nusselt number for the whole thing, averaging like this. ye- yeah, i th- oh so your  yeah but you put 'em in here and then you get just one H, one average H for the  yeah right? yeah so you don't really need to break anything apart anymore, like you don't need to  oh yeah, alright or sorry, times the K or times the total L. times the total L, right divided by K.   mhm oh so this L, for each situation the L will be, total L. um, for_   well see this thing doesn't even have_ like when you do this you get this thing this equation times some L yeah tim- times K over L. H is, this, times K over L. because it's yes.    it seems like when    because it seems like that would be a way that it's weighting it too because like if like, if this part's small, mhm right so um, okay but, let's you're canceling your things out though too  alright, (you) can write it down (xx) so, let's, say, for this thing for H-X of laminar we have, it's K over X-C.    L minus X-C? right. okay it is. yeah, that's what i was thinking. actually of course,   no no it's X  okay okay times point_ and there's a coefficient here which you're not given it's two-nine-six actually, (not) two-point-eight, so this is the coefficient that you actually put in here but you don't really need to know it. oh really? because you know when you integrate it you'll get this and that's all you need to know.   if i evaluate, these two points i can get,  no no no i'm saying this is the equation for the local one that you put in there oh oh okay. but you actually don't need it because you know when you integrate it what kind of, constant you get here. oh okay so you don't really need to know the constant you just have to know, what kind of functionality it will have for, Reynolds because you're integrating differently, and, you've_ well we talked about this this will be Reynolds to the point-eight at the end minus Reynolds to the point-eight, yeah okay at the transition point, mhm  mhm so you   yeah the two  mhm    yep    mhm       oh     okay okay okay i think   okay then just don't worry about it. oh  yeah.   oh okay     mkay cuz for,     okay for the last part um when you're trying to figure out, D-D D-T, um basically what i was doing was just taking the Q and dividing it by the, um latent heat fusion, and then saying that that was my D-M D-T, mhm    absolutely right. um,       okay okay thanks  sure... Jose. hello Ali how are you? you're late. yeah but i_ it's just a short, okay okay, let me actually_ if, see if you can can i ask you one question   but we're only talking about the   okay, thank you. sure i basically, i basically have it done but i just wanted to run it by you so you make sure that, i was, doing it right, so for the first problem what i did is assumed, that to be my, bulk f- b- bulk, temperature so my T-L was that.   okay how did you recalculate  mhm   okay i'll tell you what it is um, do you know what um, V times A do you know what this is?   no, volume flow rate. vol- that's right     exactly so M-dot. so so for_ from here we can say that, rho times V times A is just M-dot correct? right right? okay so that's what you're  mhm   yeah uh so, got my Nusselt number, got my H, uhuh make sure you put your units for the temperatures. okay. alright uh the grader's gonna take points off. alright   yes, so and what delta-T do you put here and what delta-T are you using  mhm uhuh correct and then this delta-T is an average of the bulk temperatures at the, outlet and bulk temperature at the, the inlet. mm the average of the inlet and_ well that average difference between the wall, and the inlet and the wall and the outlet   which is that one there, and then that's that comes out to that and just plug and chug, mhm okay yes    oh    for the second problem. uh, i figure out the Q, well uh fir- the first thing i did was um, calculate in my Reynolds number so i could use the Nusselt again Nusselt equation for flow,  yes but this is when your whole heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime. which means, if you have a situation like this, this is the plate right? mhm and then there's flow, there's flow going over it right? oh there is flow going_ i didn't know you see, i assumed that the iceberg was basically floating because if you assume actual physical conditions of a, of the iceberg you would have shrinkage, on all s- all directions you wouldn't, have    mhm  mhm from here it's turbulent. now, this equation holds when, all of the heat transfer starts when the tur- when the, um, viscous boundary layer is already turbulent. okay  right  right okay okay? so the heat transfer starts when the flow is already turbulent. then you can use this equation. for the  mhm    because you're putting the L the total  you know that it's turbulent here but it doesn't mean that it's turbulent  alright so it's laminar for some part and then it starts to become turbulent, right? so for the first part of the thing it's laminar. but, i would say do something. go and check, where it becomes laminar. um, where it where it tran- where the  until you hit five times  mhm  right right so you know where it's,  right?  right and if this length is very short then you can say okay for most part it's turbulent. okay  how would, would you then consider, heat flow, uh, not parallel but perpendicular,   yeah yeah. so you have, two different Hs you get  so check your calculations and see if, um   okay.  right right? and then, using this Q and getting the_ this known value i can figure out what, what the,     mhm this one, mhm i think i know how to do it, i wanna run it through,  yes, correct this is J_ H-ou- outside. yes and that's that's the one that you say we should iterate on? um, yes but your equation is not correct your equation is like this it's delta-T over  mhm right right? that's called_ that's T-naught. okay and this delta-T you don't know T-naught, and, in this H also you don't know T-naught. right,  that's why you say if you guess first, a T-naught if you guess a T-naught you can calculate this, and then you can calculate Q from Q you can calculate T-naught back. oh okay, right. okay? so you guess a T-naught first, and then you calculate your H for outside, mhm  alright okay? okay and then you iterate. alright okay okay? alright thank you very much. this T-naught is outside right?  yes okay. alright thank you very much.  	1
LEL200JU105.json	and so, between the lecture, the lab, and your discussions for Chem one-twenty-five, that should, be sufficient for you to do well, in Chemistry one-twenty-five (the advanced.) the difference probably comes to some degree in your backgrounds. the purpose of the lecture is to, cover the background material that you need, to get acquainted with to perform satisfactorily in the lab. however, typically there's fifty minute time intervals to do that. and so, you're going to have to decide, uh, after you leave the lecture whether you need to do additional reading on, a particular topic. because i'm just kind of reaching for some kind of common denominator, in terms of how i approach the material. and i'm also, uh covering it based on the feedback i get from you. so therefore it is important before we discuss topics, that you email me, with questions that you have, on that particular topic. so that i can maybe address them here in the lecture, okay as best i can or i will tell you, that it is not going to be addressed in the lecture because you are to discover that in the lab, and it will be discussed in your discussion itself. it is really the discussion is really important, that is where you share and discuss the results of the lab, and, really, focus on the implications of the results. and that is what the exams focus on. now in some cases you're going to have a discussion and you don't have one yet that's graded that's officially on material that we did on the exam, till you finish experiment two. and you may find that, your peer presentations, left you in some cases, (xx) uh feeling, well i'm not sure, about what those results were. it is really important to follow up on that, and in terms of even dropping in on another discussion, going to office hours, talking with your instructor about what happened there. also you will see on the syllabus that, just before exams occur, there will be a review session that i will do and some others will do, where i will highlight what the major findings were for the labs, to make sure that we are all in agreement. you don't have to come to the review session, i'll also put that up on the web. okay, so you have that to look at if you are uncertain about what the data was saying. okay, we'll address this term's, data. but between all those things you should be (directing) (xx) (this course) yourself, to, uh, to do well on those examinations. okay so keep those questions coming. the topic for your, upcoming lab you're starting your first officially graded lab they start on a two, it's called, uh water purity. and to illustrate that i have a cover of Chemical Engineer News, on the left screen, which has a picture of Venice Italy. and in Venice Italy, uh there is a big concern with the water purity, there are many industrial plants surrounding Venice that in particular discharge, heavy metals, into those waters. and those heavy metals in particular cause a lot of environmental damage. they're not only toxic, but they tend to get involved in many reactions including the type that you are studying in experiment two precipitation, reactions. now, when i say heavy metals i don't mean just the atomic form of metals, and i'm talking about, the metal that have higher masses so that they're, over here in the right of the Periodic Table and down into what we call the Transition and Post-Transition Area. and there in particular there's one culprit we're very concerned with mercury. okay and i'm going to be doing an illustration with mercury H-G, uh in a moment, but it is not the metal that actually is in the water that's the concern it's the metal ions. and an ion is a charged form of the metal. actually they charge, positively, and all our metals that go into solution, are positively charged they're called cations. and these cations tend to associate with negatively charged, species, called anions. and in our oceans in particular we have, a lot of, the salt sodium chloride, that contains N-A, that's the, symbol for sodium, and, C-L, the symbol for chlorine, and in solution we find we have the positively charged sodium atom called sodium cation, and it, tends to get attracted and, combine with chloride ion. and this is an artist's rendition of what is the most common salt in our oceans, sodium, chloride. all you'll be dealing with in this lab important, to keep in mind are salts. salts contain, positively charged ions called cations, and negatively charged ions, called anions. the way i think of cations is i picture a cat, two round circles for the eyes with, two, positive charges, (which) by positive charge meaning eye. whatever you can use to remember, what a cation is versus an anion that works for you, great. there's a lot of terminology in these labs and we need to find, methods for, learning, the language. so here we are all these compounds will contain, cations and anions, and we will call them salts. the exception to calling them salts, is the following, if the cation is a hydrogen ion H-plus, then we'll be calling it an acid if it's got O-H-minus we call it a base, and if it's got oxygen O-two-minus, we call it an acid-anhydride. don't worry i'm not going to examine you now on, which are salts acids and bases, i just want you to know that for a fact. and another important fact is when these ions combine they combine in such a way that they neutralize each other's charges, so that the total positive and negative charge, is neutral. 	1
LES445SU067.json	for the slight, delay. so everything went okay in my absence despite the fact that we had an overly uh, uh this week's homework was a little bit difficult, to finish with the project with the p- yeah you do have the project tonight so we're all gonna be, buncha engineers in here talking about ethics from six to eight so this should be, a lotta fun. um, yep. well it's one of those weeks where you have a little extra, remind me which chapter the homework was on. five five which is? interaction interactions  it's interactions of radiation with  yeah okay so i'm still where, i think we need to be, um, we'll see how things go you've got until Thursday on that we'll try to, cover the charged particles today. we have some guests in the classroom so i'll let them introduce and say what they're doing. okay? see at least we're not having this tonight when we've got the ethics, and you guys are all presenting. so engineers do i- do uh, do the humanities which is quite, quite interesting. okay. mm, we did charged particles already did we not? we did yeah   yeah we did that  we always do all of it we did what? we did all of it we did all of it i think we did because that's what i've got marked down here, okay. we'll do photons today. woo hoo hooray. so you've actually should be able to do the homework we did the charged particles before. oh before we start um, you happen to have had all the accident management you could possibly want the day of the criticality accident in Japan. i did warn you all that there's um, uh, the, that i had an assignment that i assigned about, patient triaging, and when i did that the next day Chernobyl happened, so i shouldn't have warned you about that were there any questions about, um, the plutonium accident discussions, uh things you've seen that you didn't uh, understand or that were puzzling to you from a health physics standpoint, or from a nuclear engineering standpoint... have they determined the cause?   it's clear to me they had no engineering controls, in the first place so there were no engineering controls, and some kind of operator error why you put, effectively a moderator blanket around a tank where you're doing precipitation of enriched fuels, totally eludes me. um, i've been following, the Radsafe which is a bunch of junk, and um, also following as b- as o- as being on the board of directors of the, A-N-S there's a lot of email traffic right now about it, and it's_ no one really knows, but it's sort of, we don't understand it. there was a U-S accident about this in Idaho, similar to this in Idaho in the sixties or seventies. you've heard that? yeah, yeah. but um, also a friend of mine is the h- uh s- sp- sp- sp- is in the department of energy and happened to be in California last week on business and was the highest ranking, D-O-E official, on the west coast at the time and she was beeped, on a pager, and told uh can she get on a plane to Japan in the next hour. she's beeped sort of uh, at an odd time. so i expect if she, ended up going over there that uh, she'll tell me what the scoop is but i jus- i think it is just a, simple um, uh, accident, but it comes on the wake of last year, when there was a chemical explosion in a fuel processing plant in Japan. this though has obvious, reactivity implications. now i looked into Cember and there is a chapter on criticality safety, that um, we may or may not get to, this term i have a feeling we won't get to it this term. at any rate, in that chapter you'll look and there's a certain concentration, of U-two-thirty-five, in, aqueous solution, if you stay below that concentration and have no reflector, you cannot have a criticality accident. this was about twenty times that, it was also a precipitation tank so they're dumping stuff in, and stuff's precipitating, at the bottom. the most difficult part of the computation is to try to figure out, you're gonna try to get doses. to try to figure out, the, um the total, energy, and the completeness, of the fission process. this is not gonna work, like a bomb because it wouldn't have reached criticality fast enough, and as soon as you start getting it happen in the aqueous solution the geometry, is gonna change so i suspect, that they poured the stuff in, it started settling, um, and, reached a critical mass because it's twenty times the concentration that's safe, and then had criticality with a large rela- or large release of energy, which then would've blown up and made the hole in the roof. what could then have continued to happen in my opinion is if you s- didn't blow everything, that way you could still have other masses of U-two-thirty-five, forming additional criticalities so you might have had, second hiccups sort of like t- tremors, after- aftershocks after an earthquake. um, but, the other thing is that with the fission products, fission product decay, from fission which this would've been a a prompt critical, fission situation, the, radionuclides decay with the half w- in- inversely, to the one-point-two power of the half-life, which i think we covered in kinetics. so, you're not decaying exponentially because you have such a mixture. the other thing is you don't necessarily have a point, geometry do you? for the irradiation you really don't know what you have afterwards, and there was contamination. interestingly, in the Ottawa Globe and Mail, uh, they didn't cover this story except on the sixth page of the first section and had no reference to it, other newspapers in Canada, had, expressly uh, photos, on the front page dominating at least a half of the front page, including a photo of thyroid monitoring with simple sodium iodine probes of children. which i found a bit, puzzling but it immediately then revealed to me that in fact, um, they were concerned about releases offsite and immediate, through inhalation and other methods, uptake, of iodine. not something that wai- waited for the cow_ get in the food chain and get in the milk into the cows. um, they were a bit slow i think passing out potassium iodide. in class you would've seen, last week that giving out potassium iodide, will block the thyroid and in cases of large iodine releases actually will help, because half the iodine actually goes, to the thyroid the other half is excreted fairly rapidly. if you load the thyroid with stable iodine you've prevented that uptake and it's mostly then excreted. so there's very little dose, uptake. it's interesting because if you looked at what, Professor Shapiro said he covered acute radiation syndrome right? also you can read in Cember, the radiation biology chapter, right? well, the um, the um, acute radiation syndrome they were reporting seven Gray, which is seven hundred rad, so you would've expected possible, central nervous system syndrome. and as my way of checking whether the newspapers were reporting correctly was that they said seven Gray, but the, patients, three of them, were uh un- uh unconscious or one was immediately unconscious and didn't come to, till later and you had several other unconscious, situations. as a result of Chernobyl however, the lethal dose fifty, is probably less than that printed in texts. because they knew exactly what to do with, bone marrow transplants and the like based upon the experience, of the people in Chernobyl. uh Doctor Shapiro should also have given you the name REACTS, R E A C T S did he do that? they would have been called over nearly immediately. i really don't know what the U-S government delay was on making statements which i heard indirectly that the government was making statements we're not gonna send assistance. and, if anything that team should've been in immediately, on the airplanes because they are the repository of information, or somebody who knew what they were saying. along the lines of public communication in Canada there, there were various sp- uh so-called experts from the United States who were, commenting in the Canadian press, i don't know what was going (on) down here, and i was asked by someone well do you uh, do you think uh, do you know this person? and i didn't know the person never heard of the person, they were clearly not an expert making some very sort of, uh, statements that were uninformed, but fancied themselves an expert because they were simply a radiologist. and it made it on the front page of newspapers in Canada. um, Professor Shapiro would be considered, an expert. he would be someone who could be called in to comment. but you really want someone with up to the date experience, practical experience on dealing with the, the victims. um, do you think this was one-over-R-squared...? do you think if you calculated the dose rates, at the tank and the dose rates at the edge of the, the plant, it would've been R, one-over-R-squared? why or why not? cuz isn't all your uh, dose, going out the roof and just uh, floating around in the atmosphere? that's the impression i got, from what i read. okay. we have to be very careful, dose, but  yeah i read somewhere i'm not sure even what the source was or, whether it was reputable or not that, a half a mile away that they couldn't measure anything above background. quite possible. again, what would be, far away? i don't know. it's clearly_ working from information reported through the press is extremely difficult. there was one thing that terribly bothered me is when they reported the doses, at various points like at the site boundary and so on, uh and they said_ gave the doses in Gray. this was in Canada. what did Ann Arbor Daily News do? Sievert Sieverts everything in the U-S that i read at least were Sieverts alright. you're gonna see that, w- at doses that high you don't use the Sievert, or the rem, because the weighting factors, the radiation weighting factors are based upon, nonstochastic effects they're not based on acute radiation syndrome. so the correct unit, would be the Gray or the rad, when your doses get that high. okay so that was one issue the other issue was, i was convinced that these numbers were dose, rates. and not doses when they talked about at the site boundary they'd say, s- eighteen hours after the accident the dose at the site, boundary was two, Sieverts. well integrated over what time? it was probably two Sieverts, per hour. so it it was very confusing to try to garner information in that way. so there probably was, acute, there was acute radiation syndrome, so the REACTS people are on it, there was central nervous system, (thing,) remember the L-D-fifties or that half the people, would die, and that the L-D-fifties are probably, conservative, in that the advances since Chernobyl, will have r- improved patient management. my worst-case estimate based on just newspaper data was that there could be as many as twenty, people, who have acute radiation syndrome and could die, but we're told nothing about the dist- physical distribution and the number of workers at the plant, we're just told there were, overexposures, at least the media_ i looked in about six newspapers, which didn't really, help me, we were also um, um, not told what the_ we were not told what the doses were. so conservatively, i'd say there are twenty, three would have had immediate effects, if their doses were higher but there're other people whose doses, would be lower. it's my understanding they've already done bone marrow transplants, on some of the, uh overexposed, individuals. the... um... but, e- the lower cases will not show severe effects, until sometime after exposure. and the degree of delay, and the lengths of the latency periods, are functions of, the total exposure and functions of, the individual. so my guesstimate, is between zero and twenty, individuals twenty being very conservative. based on newspaper information. now can such an accident happen, i told you it did already, can it happen in the United States outside, our weapons, compounds? fe- l- you had an Ida- I-N-E-L Idaho accident. can it happen outside, in say our, pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor environments? i need the help of the nuclear engineers in the class. i don't think so why, Darren? um, they said that they had procedures in place, at this place in Japan, and i thought that they, blatantly violated 'em. the procedures about criticality accidents are very carefully controlled. um, and they won't let you have, enough, uranium close to it, within a specified area and they're like really really conservative, on how much that they'll allow on a certain, range. like when we received new fuel, we'd have like, two fuel bundles in the crate, mhm Mike, do you know the enrichment of commercial, fuel in the, pressurized and boiling water reactors in the U-S? uh... two-thirty-eight pardon me? two-thirty-eight two-th- yeah what's the uh_ two-thirty-five what's the enrichment? what's the definition of enrichment? it's what U-two-thirty_ for uranium fuel it's U-two-thirty-five per uranium, and natural, uranium is about point-oh-oh-seven-two percent yeah it's like ninety-eight-point-something percent er- i don't think so (that's,) natural, and then, enrichment is_ i don't understand what you're saying what uh what is the enrichment? sir i, you had a knowing look there. what's the enrichment of U-S fuels? i know it's not ninety-eight percent pardon me? i know it wasn't that earlier ninety-eight percent ninety-eight percent?  it's three to four percent isn't   okay, so even at fairly  yep yep. now i'm not sure how hi- if i like this, conversation being recorded or not. this is really in the hands of a_ i i don't know. this is_ maybe we can like delete this part because this would get us in trouble, because we're ver- having a very comfortable_ we're having a very comfortable discussion and we certainly would have a different discussion with members of public present and i forgot y'all were here. but, in fact now i'm feeling like i need to, sort of, address she's gonna okay, well but you're not in this class, cuz i know the answers. do you wanna try it?  so it's just a psychological thing that we do as part  exactly in fact i would propose that was a meaningless, technically meaningless thing to do, but we do it anyway in case that's correct right? okay so. um, w- you would have gotten killed, the reporter would be gone already. yeah and Professor Lee would be calling you up saying can you please write an article, like we had back in the other (xx) do- don't but ac- with this audience if we didn't have the outsiders in here, we'd be okay. any other comments on things we might have said where we would have gotten misquoted...? Marty? i don't know  go ahead oh. i  they said, they said but natural, natural background's only one millimeter per year. so that's very confusing. Shelly you mean Shari uh  they're gonna    i agree a hundred percent now i didn't really finish the discussion and i see you Tom so we'll get  pretty much you covered what i was gonna say but, could, like this nev- this ex- like an accident pretty similar to this could never happen at a reactor because we don't process fuel at our reactors. that's right. you know that's right so, it's_ a- as far as looking at it as a reactor, at a reactor it's kind of a now you could have, a criticality incident oh yeah. yeah but it wouldn't be anything of this magnitude or this sudden, you know where, suddenly you, put six, or however many times the amount of uranium, you're supposed to have in it, and it_  cuz once the water, vaporizes you lose your moderator and that's right. once the water vaporizes you lose your moderator and it shuts down the reaction there's also the, what is it? negative temperature coefficient, inherent in our design which was not present at Chernobyl, that as temperature rises, the neutronics become, less, favorable, so the reaction will shut down... anything else...? okay. but this sort of making statements it cannot happen today it cannot happen in this country, can be ta- are taken with a grain of salt, because, they've heard scientists saying this before specifically they've heard people in the nuclear industry saying this before, and, it happened. i'm sure before our criticality accident in the ne- in Idaho, people may have said that. your your credibility, is far less, than your technical ancestors', credibility your great-grandfathers of nuclear. their, your credibility is much, less. and in fact some of those statements are gonna be interpreted to_ they'll s- just stop, stop listening, listening to you. okay? lower lower, of course. and it, with an a change in scattering angle. if we said we had a free electron binding energy of the electrons are the order of, what, Ellen uh free electron in electron volts. um thirteen-point-six you wanna say that's probably K-E-V for lead. so they're less than K-E-V, that's a lead X-ray it is is that amount so, the difference in energy levels, between the real estate of the atomic electrons, their R levels are like real estate, sitting out there, and you can have electrons occupying the real estate or not the real estate is always there, but the difference in, in uh neighborhoods, classes of neighborhoods is about thirteen-point-six K-E-V for lead, electrons, that's the X-ray you get, if you have something de-exciting from say the the uh L to the K shell, so K shell, so they're gonna be less than K-E-V. they can be the order of electron volts, for less tightly bound, electrons along the outside do you mainly get Compton scattering with, less tightly bound or more tightly bound electrons...? now i'm gonna ask Shelly... don't know i'm gonna tell you in a minute. anyone know? it's hard to remember all these things. let's treat this though first as a classic, mechanics problem, with the incident photon, and the free electron, that's sitting with no kinetic energy and no binding energy. we're gonna idealize this so we can do a classic mechanics treatment, and then we say afterwards we have a electron (scale,) uh and a photon, we can write down the conservation of momentum, the total energy, you can write this if you prefer, a- a- using Planck's law, Planck's law converts particle, particle treatments, into wave treatments, and back and forth. it allows us to assign a momentum to a photon, it allows us to assign, um, energy, a- r- in relationship to wavelength, so if i wrote conservation of energy, conservation of momentum in the two directions, just a little vector, uh vector stuff here, and photon electron, wavel- uh wavelength change we could, do a lot of, um algebra, and we would come down, to an equation that said the change in wavelength, between the incident and scattered photon, is gonna be proportional to, um, the, Planck's constant, and proportional to the rest mass energy in some way close to the rest mass energy over the wavelength that, is uh, rest mass energy times C not C-squared, times one minus cosine-theta so it depends upon the angle of scatter, and if you put in, um, some of n- the values of the constants, you get that delta-U, is point-oh-two-four-two one minus cosine-theta, where, this is the wavelength change in angstroms. if i plotted this you see the wavelength change as a function of angle scattering, if you completely turn the photon around, and it goes back, scatters at a hundred, and eighty degrees, it's gonna lose, maximum energy it's gonna have the largest wavelength, change. and, here it's just a curve folding over on itself, because you don't know if forty-five degrees this way is, three hundred and sixty minus forty-five degrees if it's above the line. so this is just the curve folding back all i did was plot that expression. things to know this is called photo- uh Compton shift, greater the angle of scatter, the greater will be its energy loss, the greater will be the Compton shift, and photons can Compton scatter at any angle. and if i tried to relay the electron in photon scattering angles i gave you the blow by blow no and then a miracle occurred type language. we get, a relationship on page twenty-three of the notes, of the flux being in an arctan relationship, and then here E is the incident energy, cotangent-theta-over-two. and i sat and put in extremes, whenever you get an equation you can play and see does this make i- e- uh sense in the extremes, i said okay if the photon scattering angle can have any value, which we established zero to two-pi, but this cod- cotangent function, only spans values from zero to pi, so theta is small, the phi, is near ninety degrees the electron, trav- the photon d- goes forward, and the electron comes off at a right angle. as theta increases to zero to a hundred and eighty, notice that the cotangent decreases from infinity to zero, therefore, you go from ninety degrees to zero. so my hand waving argument is, for the electron, recoil angle is always confined to the forward direction. by classical mechanics, the f- electron always goes forward. now it could scatter in some bizarre way and come back, highly unlikely. but there_ the photons, can go in any angle, electrons always go forward they go more forward, depending on the, uh Compton angles. here's electron angle as a function of photon angle, this is a cotangent, function and what i'm saying to you is for scattering between zero and three-sixty, of the photon, you only have electrons between minus-ninety and ninety degrees. more energetic incident photons forward scatter the Compton electrons, and you can't have electrons, more than plus or minus ninety degrees, scatter. so that's to know. i can do more on scattered photon energy i can compute the minimum photon scattering energy and lo and behold, it turns out that the minimum, uh photon scattering lower? you would want lower energies because you would want more back scatter, at_ which is around a hundred and eighty degrees. they are using some back scatter ti- techniques usually with neutrons however, to, do things like look into, uh spaces that you can't normally look into and you can't get a detector on the other side of, I-E this could be used for looking into safes, for various spy things, as well as characterizing or checking materials, to see, uh, what the composition is below the surface. here's a polar plot of the same thing, again that's Klein-Nishina, you can do Klein-Nishina formula and figure out electron angles, here's another polar plot they all see the same thing. so you should know these things in summary, about angular distribution. alright we, these then should be clear these are the Compton edges, where you, you must lose a certain amount of energy in Compton scattering so if this incident photon, then your elec- your things are gonna come out in that area (and) you do see something that has, starts an edge, in a spectrum. yes, Mike um is, is it always point-two-five-six for the Compton edge? cuz i know in the homework you gave us, it's completely off (in the end.) where di- e- i- ch- it's varies as a function of the energy of the incident photon. where are you getting the point-two-five-six? wha- what  in three-fifteen uh we always use like point-two-five-six as what? the, distance from the incident gamma to the, Compton edge alright let's see okay would you always get point-two-five-six...? let's look elsewhere. where's my um, i liked it in this form. the, wavelength shift i mean the okay the shift. so to me that would say it is always less and you're that number is point? two-five-six. two-five-six. and that would be in? M-E-V? yeah okay. that is correct. if that number is correct, this equation says there should be a constant.  what's it say? well ther- the spots that i picked up, one uh says that the three workers that did it they were on the assignment for the first time, it was the first time they ever did the job. mhm um, two paragraphs here, that are exactly what you were just talking about uhuh and uh Paul's point the other one that i've got here is um, uhuh. uncool very uncool. Darren can you share that with everyone please? sure,  just reading the Daily, today, on the second page there's an article about what we were just talking about. and um, the couple of things that i noted were, that one one of these paragraphs say that the three workers it was the very first time that they had ever done the job, uh, the other paragraph, uh it says um, hasn't, Japan's had, had some other, uh decently-sized accidents that really haven't gotten out, uh i know they had a leak last year at one of their, plants that went undetected for, a couple months i think. mhm mhm. now there's differences between something being technically possible, and assurances that something cannot happen, and in some cases it's technically impossible, i think to have an accident like this at a processing plant, for CANDU fuel is technically, impossible. mm, if they go to an aqueous phase which i don't know enough about to comment but, i would certainly_ in responding to the press i would certainly have found out whether, what the different processes are and made a few calls to be able to comment, um, and be seen, between something being viewed as improbable. remember though th- Three Mile Island, was, predicted, by a nuclear engineering professor at M-I-T, Norm Rasmussen, the lost fourteen-hundred port, uh report. it predicted that in so many, reactor hours megawatt years, of nuclear reactor, operation, we would have a small bu- so many small break locus, and other events. the focus was unfortunately, on, the catastrophic event, and not the s- the the bad event, bad from an economic standpoint, bad from public relations standpoint, certainly Three Mile Island was not a, a a, a health significant, event. but um... oh i lost it, but th- there it was probable it would happen and the predictions were that it should happen, and then it happened and everyone acted surprised. if you operate for so many hours, and th- p- you have these tiny probabilities, sooner or later it's gonna happen and it's statistics though, you can't guarantee, it wouldn't happen. if it's technically possible. the best thing that ever happened to the U-S nuclear power industry, from a safety viewpoint, in my mind, was the Three Mile Island accident. as a result in my opinion of the Three Mile Island, accident, you had, um, greater emphasis on operations, compliance, the Nuclear Regulatory C- Commission rode in in white hats and said we're now the good guys ha ha ha, in things about communications, they were trying to call the designers at Babcock and Wilcox Company, to get some information on what was going on, the phone lines out of Pennsylvania were tied up because the governor had made his statement, and they had no separate, phone, they had inadequate if if any, special phone connections and they could not reach, the chief, fellow who could've been able to m- uh'oh i know why this is behaving strangely, which in part was responsible for the melt. so, the communications improved, operator training, in everything was completely redone, and i think we now have much safer plants than before Three Mile Island. now we don't have new plants, but we have much safer existing, plants. so from the viewpoint of, safety of operating commercial power reactors in the United States, Three Mile Island was a key event in terms of improving them. the concept of operator error. and operator error upon operator error, upon operator error. we are human we make, mistakes. have i told you Three Mile Island was the reactor that cried wolf...? what ha- one of the things i heard_ and these are insider stories cuz i worked at, Babcock and Wilcox Company when they designed, the Three Mile Island, and knew the folks and so i called them i was in graduate school then and i called, called 'em up and said you know what's going on you know i used to rent a house from the main response guy, before, before the Three Mile Island accident, i rented a room in his house, and um, he said this is the reactor that cried wolf basically, because, it got, um, um, they were starting up and you know when you have a system like oh like a smoke detector, right? you got a smoke detector, it might be too sensitive if you put it too close to the stove right? and any amount of steam will set it off, sometimes dust will set it off, it's hypersensitive it's, it's crying out to you all the time there's a problem when there isn't. well one of their, um, systems kept_ when they were tr- first bringing things up to power, kept tripping things off and saying there's a problem here there's a problem here, and that kept, happening so they, took it out of the sy- system, eventually. but w- after this happened three or four times it went off again and they said oh just ignore it, that's that uh, that system again let's defeat it, and in fact that was, a real warning. this is folklore i don't know if it is true. it's folklore within, people who who were there. why were there releases to the environment? at all? well you had all these lovely systems, well there was some point where there was an override, they were taking the water out of the the, basement, and then they have all the water E-C-C-S water, uh emergency core cooling system water, was, gone in the basement and then they pump it out and put it in holding tanks, well something happened i don't recall whether it was that they, failed, to, take an action to switch tanks, or whether someone overrode the switch, but basically they filled up a tank, till it was overfull which caused pressure problems then they had to vent through the roof. that's other for- folklore, from, from the inside. but again i don't know what is true and what is not true but when you start hearing stories like that, from people in the business you say well what next? you know they're defeating, the safety systems. um, what are the qualification levels of a reactor operator? do you know, what kind of education do you have to have? going in? um, not much. most of the training is done inside have a high school degree? do you hafta have a high school degree? yeah i think you hafta have a high school degree but i don't think you hafta have anything beyond that. that's right. sometimes it's two year Associate's degree but, i- they they take people with high school degrees and they're the people who are running these things. but those were the people you probably want. i was lucky enough to get on the U-S-S Alabama, the nuclear sub, and while i was on the nuclear sub i w- s- looked at all around at all the people and the guy who was in charge of pushing the button, looked like he could've been any one of your all's, um, younger brothers. i mean he looked about seventeen. and someone who was doing critical steering for the entire sub, looked about, seventeen. these are not really, couldn't have gone through college much too young, well they can follow orders and directions, in general. you want someone who can follow orders and directions, but not just that, if something's wrong will call, they will call, and get help it's kind of like the, the woman from Brooklyn in the red dress that i hired in the PET Facility, told you that, story i think. is that she, she was the only one everyone else had all these theories how to deal with my, my interview question. she said i would call you first. cuz i'd know something was wrong i'd be scared, and i'd call you first. i then proceeded to train her what to do in the actual accident which did involve calling me, only i was being called, second. jeez 	1
LES175SU028.json	um, hate to break up this, party here. uh first i brought the book that i thought that i had but didn't have this morning, and uh, this is a, Atlas of Breeding Birds of Michigan, and, it's a tremendous resource, and i i'm gonna put it up in the bird lab, because, it'll be important for you to look at when you're putting together the, the project, um paper. and i'm just gonna show you for example, the Merlin. um this, side of the page has, basically a summary on biology ecology and so on, and this is a, map using breeding birds survey data, showing, um, what's known about the distribution of Merlins in the state, so you can see from the blue dots that, you know there's not a lot concentrated up here on Isle Royale, then if i just flip to uh_ give me another species. oh here i'll do it i just wanted to, uh, here's the cowbird for example RESTRICTED um, about ninety-one i believe or, ninety, or ninety-one... nineteen ninety-one parrots?  um, a non-game program, means, in i- in a typical, Department of Natural Resources, um, they would have, like a division of fishes, and their money and their, energy would be going in to making sure there are enough perch to keep the population of, Michigan the fishing population happy, enough walleye enough, trout in in the streams enough, you know so all game, related. they, had no concern about things like sturgeon, that were declining, no money would go there, uh, even though sturgeon is a game fish they're just not common enough, to worry about and they never would be, so, they would kind of fall by the wayside a lot of the, um there's some, uh tremendously interesting minnows and other non-game non-hunted, essentially species that, that uh would not get any attention. in, in the, uh wildlife section, you would have somebody who deals with upland game, the grouse, the woodcock, the snipe, then you'd have a specialist who dealt with the waterfowl. um, for example, and then you would have somebody, who was the forest ungulates, the moose and the deer, and_ or large game, (include) bear, and somebody, who also or several people who were dealing with, the h- the trap, trapping, small, mammal species, those are all the game, hunted for game or, harvested for, um, a product for humans. non-game is anything that's not hunted. so, um, most of the bird species for example. (what's that?) so, mo- until the ei- n- nineteen eighties, states did not even, think about it they put no money towards, um, chickadees or, owls or, you know whatever. it was just believed that, the energy that went into protecting the game species, would spill off and protect, the non-game. so if you set aside a wildlife refuge for waterfowl, then, think of all the good it would do for Marsh Wrens and bitterns and so on. and, um, the same for forested areas, so the nineteen eighties was a real key point of, getting, um, the public and and getting legislators to you know change, the way money was appropriated. okay so now we're, at a time, where people are, um, are recognizing that we don't have the time, we don't have the money, to focus species by species or population by population so, the energy has to be, spread, more widely. and, uh, many bird conservation efforts, are focused at the community or ecosystem level. that's what i've, been trying to do with Piping Plover work, is to think about the other species of plants that are involved think of the entire dune complex, use the plover as, a, species with federal status that can help, in, in protection um, but, don't do it at the expense of other species, which is what has happened, in the past. now, here we are, now, ki- dangling at this, or headed in this direction of, of, concern for global or regional biodiversity protection, and the question, is you know what what's the next step in the future well, i don't know, exactly where it is, but i see one issue, that's coming up in terms of, conservation and management, that people are having tremendous problems dealing with, and that is we are now, we've been very successful with a lot of species, and, human activities are changing, um, ecosystems, and we're having global, pattern changes, and we now have overabundant wildlife, and some of these are tolerable, at, certain levels, some are, not tolerable, in a lot of different spots, and some are causing, um, very significant ecosystem problems, um in, big regions of the of, North America, i'm gonna give you the details on this in just a few minutes. um, so i see that as an area that is, going to be very challenging because, it involves ethics, it involves, you know, where do we step in and say, these numbers are too much for us to bear as humans, um, and, wh- how should we make these decisions, whether to, try and control populations and how should this be done, should it be done. should we do this for every species, that we see as a nuisance, or are we naturally gonna see these fluctuations anyway, and do we need to step back and just let them occur, knowing that, there will be some, times when, people feel uncomfortable with, the density of a particular species. and, this is, you know something that's occurring with plants, insects, you know, mammals, it also has occurred, with birds. okay i think that i've covered, everything i wanted to, about legislation and these general stages so what i wanna do now is go through some slides, and talk about, the species and how they fit into these different, um conservation stages but, i'm gonna have to answer some questions, Sally (xx) RESTRICTED um the, nineteen sixty-six is the year that, is typically given, um i can't tell you, um i don't know when the Bald Eagle Act was, um was initially passed and, what happens is that the Endangered Species Act is peri- periodically up for re-authorization, and, a few years ago it was, very um, close, there was a lot of heavy pressure and and people were really looking at the Endangered Species Act and then that was the time when the federal government was shut down, um, for whatever it ended up being a week or so, and that just kind of brought, that re-authorization process to an end. the w- concerns about the Endangered Species Act it's considered, the most powerful piece of environmental, legislation that, has ever been passed, um, there are, a lot of concerns by biologists and by non-biologists. there are concerns that it, um infringes on, um, citizen rights, when um uh endangered species occur on private land, uh that's a very big issue that is, uh leading a lot of, legislators to, push, to have, modifications or changes made there. from, a biologist's perspective, um there are many cases where the Endangered Species Act has been used, uh to, promote the, survival of a single species at the cost of other species within the ecosystem, um and people feel uncomfortable with that, one of the, things that people may, feel most uncomfortable about, those who work with endangered species is the allocation of money. there are about ten species that, end up getting, you know about fifty million dollars a year, a- from Congress and, these species are, not logically, ones that you would feel should be receiving the money some of them are but, um, some are marginal in terms of, um, uh, their... they are, rare anyway in North America, there's been some efforts that have gone into ocelots and some of the species that are, found in Central America and occur just over, the border in southwestern U-S and received a lot of money, the California Condor has received, tremendous amounts of money, um, and you know maybe for, justifiable reasons a huge amount of money went into the bald eagle, Kirtland's Warbler here in, in the state of Michigan, has received millions of dollars, and then there are other species like the Piping Plover that we typically get about ten thousand dollars a year, which, barely pays for anything, so people feel there should be more of a reallocation of funds, um, and, that these you know really, big money species uh, need to be evaluated re-evaluated as to whether, that's justifiable. and a lot of the decisions seem to be, very political as to which critter, gets the money. think of the money that's gone into the spotted owl issue. you know maybe some of these, um, you know i could argue on either side, uh but that's been a big issue with the Endangered Species Act. okay. have you guys eaten your fireballs? alright, you better cuz i'm gonna, turn (the slide on...) and just, burst in if you have questions. let me see, we'll have to figure something out no, there oops... might wanna back it up a little, get it a little bigger. okay now, what i want you to keep in mind is i'm gonna go through i talked about those different stages, and i'm gonna go through and give some examples, and, the first one's the period of, uh, of abundance and, and fouled with, overharvest, and this might, be a surprise to you, but one of the groups that was very heavily harvested were the shore birds. they would come, um through areas during migration in, the hundreds of thousands, and millions of birds they'd congregate along shorelines, and they were shot for food, and in fact, they're very um good eating, um and many species and the Piping Plover is one that, there are records of them being harvested, i don't know what kind of impact, um there may have been on, on plovers. have you ever eaten a plover? oh no RESTRICTED uh, no i've never eaten a shorebird i've eaten um, i've uh tasted uh Herring Gulls, and Caspian Terns, birds that, um  Ring-billed gull Ring-billed gull and, uh this has a neat story that you don't, hear about elsewhere, um, it's really not written up anywhere but it is, in old literature so you can find it, um, the Ring-billed gull, was present, um during, you know the settlement time, presettlement, and in what numbers we really don't know but it, it was present in the great lakes. um, by, the, early nineteen hundreds it had disappeared as a breeding species in the great lakes, which is hard to imagine. in the state of Michigan right now, um based on the survey we did this summer, there are about a hundred thousand pairs, nesting, um in the state of Michigan. so what would happen to cause the ringbills to disappear as a breeding species in the great lakes? they nest in, good-sized colonies, and they have an egg that's, um, ranked as being a high, uh, in terms of its uh taste, palatability, there is actually a scale of, of egg palatability that somebody worked out quite some time ago, and, um, when harvesting of eggs for food was, was a, legal thing to do. so, market hunters, um, knew about these egg supplies and they would start, at the south end of Lake Michigan at the south end of Lake Huron so Detroit region Chicago region, they would move north the colonies really don't start, until about Saginaw, for the for Lake Huron and then they go all the way up to, northern Lake Huron where we, had breakfast at Search Bay the area where we did the Black Tern census, and then they s- the Ring-bi- Ring-billed colonies start, about um, a line at about Traverse City, the islands off the_ offshore the Manitous and so on, and so these boats would stop, at all the ringbill colonies on their way north, and they would smash, all of the eggs. they'd go north as far as they could, they'd turn back, and then they'd stop at all the islands, and wherever they found, eggs, those they would collect because they knew they were fresh. they were, uh um, early in incubation so they were not gonna have large embryos, and, then they would ta- pack these in the barrels of salt, and take them down to Chicago and Detroit, to be sold in the markets. now at the same time, it was a tremendous fashion for women to ha- wear feathers, um, in hats and on their clothing, here and also in Europe. and birds with white feathers were particularly sought after because these feathers can be dyed. so adults were also harvested. so this type of market hunting in very intense pressure went on, with the ringbill gulls and because they nest in large colonies they were, um much more vulnerable than the Herring Gulls that tend to have less dense colonies. so, the ringbill was knocked back, and it was through, protection efforts, um that made it illegal to sell these feathers and illeg- illegal to sell the eggs in these large markets, that brought the ringbill gull back, and by nineteen twenty-four the first, um gulls were, ringbills were reported nesting in um, the northern Great Lakes it was either Huron or, i think it was in northern Lake Huron, and then they've slowly increased, to the point where in many areas they're now, perceived as a problem because they've done so well, um in association, with humans. but this was a species that was harvested, to extinction within a region, um, okay here's another species that was heavily harvested, this is? Sandhill Crane Sandhill Crane Sandhill Crane Mourning Dove yeah Mourning Dove, you didn't know they were so, gaudy, did you, blue eye-ring and all those details. well, the Mourning dove is not the one i'm, gonna talk about, it's actually the Passenger Pigeon, that i think is the most interesting of the overharvested species, and, the the Passenger Pigeon is, um believed to have been, the most abundant land bird, ever, on the face of the earth, uh uh historically and up to modern times, existed in the billions, and they were a bird of the eastern deciduous forests. they were a massed crop feeder, feeding on beechnuts, it was a prime food source for them, and also on acorns, but primarily beech, and, they would, um they were also colonial nesters and roosters, and wherever they occurred, they occurred in the hundreds of thousands, and there were historical, nest sites and roost sites, that you know people, reported, you couldn't help miss it, i mean if you've got, um s- several hundred thousand birds on your property you, you know that. and, um they of course, doves are hunted, in many states and and, and the Passenger Pigeon uh as a an adult bird the meat was, highly sought after, they weren't, no one was interested in the eggs but the young were also eaten the squabs, and it was the same thing as with the gulls there were, a handful of people, you know we're talking about dozens and dozens of people throughout, the Eastern deciduous forest but in comparison to the, the whole, um human population in in Eastern North America was small, um who became organized to hunt, the Passenger Pigeon, and bring these in to the large market so l- large markets throughout the Eastern U-S, and there were a number of things that went on that helped this, um, this whole process. one was the railroad, came in. and there were railroad lines throughout Eastern U-S so they could quickly, ship, put, birds, onto uh the train and send 'em into markets, immediately. another was the invention of the telegraph, they could communicate, somebody could send a message and say, i've just found a colony of, you know, here in uh, southern Wisconsin at such and such a place, and they'd get twenty men on the train and, whip over there and, and uh harvest them. um, so, the the communication network and the transportation netw- network, was really critical, um in terms of the demise, so to speak of the Passenger Pigeon. well another thing about Passenger Pigeons that played an important role is that they're, highly social and, uh it's thought that they, n- n- will not nest solitarily and and do not, really could not be successful unless there were large numbers of them, and it's not sure exactly, what those reasons are but, the market hunting of course could not, individually kill, billions of birds, but they went in year after year, for ten or more years and constantly disturbed these colonies, so that birds were deserting, the young were dying, um birds were being killed, birds were not breeding so they, the Passenger Pigeon, did not breed for ten to fifteen years, and, literally, in that short time period, um, became extinct. the last bird died in captivity, uh in the Cincinnati zoo, in the um early nineteen hundreds. so this is a, this example has been such a powerful one, how could you ever imagine, that something that existed in the billions, a vertebrate no less, could be driven to extinction, um, in such a short time period. well, it did happen and it's_ you know it really is a symbol of, of um, not the conservation movement but the, overharvest and the impact potential impact that humans can have, um on a species or on populations, so it's a a very very powerful story and figured, in an important way in um, in subsequent conservation efforts. okay the next, group so that's really the period of, uh abundance and overharvest and the next group, the next issue i wanna talk about is the era of, wildlife management, and the studies on ecology. and here's a species of Canada Goose that you're well familiar with, you've heard me say a few things about it, this was an overharvested species. in the state of Minnesota, they were extirpated they were eliminated as a breeding species, in, the nineteen twenties, in the state. that's a long time ago. and, the, uh, w- people in charge of waterfowl the Department of Natural Resources folks, said, this is a tremendous resource, people want this they want to be able to harvest Canada Geese, we will bring them back. so they did this through reintroduction, by bringing in birds from other states where the populations were more robust. well, what's happened in Minnesota, is that we now have a huge population of Canada Geese, and they are valued as a hunted speci- species so there is a hunting season, but they also, are viewed as a non-game species, people, have, many, um, urban, areas have brought Canada Geese into their, parks, and at first this was wonderful, because there'd be a couple families and everybody'd like to go, and see their babies in the spring and, and then all of a sudden the numbers began to increase, and the birds, get up on the golf greens and eat the grass, which is not appreciated, and defecate, which is not appreciated and they defecate in tremendous amounts, um, on sidewalks where runners are jogging around the lakes in the twin cities there's always a crisis about, too many geese, but at the same time, um, when they tried to, do something about it, there were people who wanted them there, even in large numbers. so it's led to a lot of, um, court cases and, interactions between animal rights groups, between management people, between, the airport, is concerned about, um, human safety, because geese are, have caused fatal accidents, and um, we're left, with a species that is, uh, an overabundant species in many areas in Minnesota they, shipped extra birds, to every place they could. finally, all those places said we don't, we can't take any more Canada Geese, and one of the things that they did, try next that were successful for a while, was doing a planned harvest and all, the geese went to (local food shelves.) and that was very popular but, there were also legal concerns and now, pressure um, from some of the animal rights groups has stopped that, and they found, somewhere, i think it's Oklahoma that they've been sending, extra geese to. so um, this is an issue we have someone in my department that back in Minnesota, who has contracts with all the local communities, or many of the local communities, um you know like five to twenty thousand dollar contracts for goose management, um every year so, here's a, single-species effort to manage, um a species for harvest that, has been too successful in that setting. Ruffed Grouse is another species that's been, managed i've mentioned this one before because, the recipe for good Ru- Ruffed Grouse production, is very opposed to, what is needed to_ for good conser- conservation of forest birds. grouse need a mix of, forest ages so it's recommended that, the forest be, uh viewed as a um, a twenty-four year, um, harvest cycle, you break it into four, sections and you rotate through, so every twenty-fourth year, the oldest um uh (plot,) aspen are allowed to grow until they're twenty-four years, and then they're harvested but you always have, um, you know every, uh six years sixth year you have some harvest that's going on so this means, you have a fragmented forest you have a very young forest and, species of birds, that do not, do well in this, in the fragmentation are, really being um, managed, to their death so to speak. so this was a, a case of single-species management, and it's been popular this is the number one, game species, uh upland game species bird species in, um Minnesota that uh more hunters uh had permits for this than than (others.) now, here's a species, uh like the Canada Geese, was extirpated, an- from a lot of regions in eastern North America the Wild Turkey, and in some cases in Minnesota it's doubtful that they ever were there, but they were close by, and, so departments of, uh wildlife had introduced turkeys. that's what, was the situation here in Michigan, turkeys were native to Michigan, um and, now uh it must have been about twenty years ago they undertook a big, reintroduction program, and that's why you're seeing them around the station area these are, birds that um probably came from Missouri, that seems to have been, one of the most successful stocks for the more northern states, so they were wild birds, found native in North America but these are not, genetically Michigan birds. well this reintroduction, goes to it i- its extreme with a number of species and the Ring-necked, Pheasant is a perfect example, this is a species that's highly desirable, hundreds of thousands of dollars go into this species, in, the w- Midwestern states, up to the millions of dollars in some, cases, to manage for the Ring-necked Pheasant this bird is found in Asia it's not a native species, and, um it does well, um in many agricultural, regions as long as there's, good cover and not, uh s- harsh winters. this was okay in the nineteen thirties to the nineteen seventies, but a lot of people questioned, the value of, and the ethics of bringing in non-native species. for a long time people thought that pheasants, had no negative impact on the land, they now know that pheasants will lay their eggs in, Prairie Chicken nests for example, and pheasant eggs hatch sooner. when they hatch, and the chicks leave the nest, the Prairie Chicken parents desert their eggs and go with the pheasant babies. so that is a negative, and it may have affected Prairie Chicken populations. the states will, probably you know within my lifetime will never touch the pheasant. it's too, it means too much financially. it's a highly desired, uh harvested species. and the negative impacts are too minor. okay, another group of, of managed species are the endangered species the s- kind of special interest ones, and the Peregrine Falcon was one, like the Bald Eagle that was affected by, um problems with, um D-D-T so that it had, eggshell thinning. and tremendous money and energy has gone into, essentially re-establishing Peregrine Falcons, uh in, um the U-S they were essentially gone, and it's been through a very intensive program, of captive rearing, and releasing birds, um into locations where they were historically, um around North America, that has re-established them they're not, uh large numbers, but they, are no longer doing, releases they are now, the the nat- the population, the current population is not being supplemented by released birds, and, um, their, um, they they've done extremely well in urban areas so that's been very popular they use, skyscrapers like cliffs and they feed on pigeons and, other, uh House Sparrows and so on, and they do very well. um, this, Bald Eagle puppet, um is being used to hand rear a young eaglet, um a lot of energy of course went into Bald Eagles in some areas, they did reintroductions, uh of young birds, in many areas it only took good protection like in the state of Michigan, the, uh national, uh ban on D-D-T along with good protection, um around the nest sites and so on has led to, a recovery that will probably take the Bald Eagle off the endangered species list, uh in a relatively short period of time. um this is a female Kirtland's Warbler, and this is another species that, received a tremendous amount of, and still continues to get a tremendous amount of financial, support um, and they require a very specific habitat, of jack pines of a certain age, and they nest only in jack pines, and it was found that they had very heavy, um parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds, and, so a, major program to remove the cowbirds, was instituted. now this is objectionable to some people, from an ethics perspective, because you are placing a higher value on the life of a, Kirtland's Warbler, than on a Brown-headed Cowbird, and, of course that's debatable in lots of different ways, but the program still, uh it continues on, and the Kirtland's after many years, are finally, they went from about two hundred, uh pairs up to over eight hundred, Sharon? um why, was there so much emphasis about this bird just be- because  oh. um what's its call? it says cheer cheer cheer Larry cheer cheer cheerlerie? cher- cheer cheer cheer Larry. oh it's, kind of off the subject, but what about the Bachman's Warbler? the the um blue book said that they might be extinct, it's kind of old though i wonder if there's i you know i really can't, i can't tell you i mean that's all i know that there's, you know there's this debate about whether or not they're still, um, they're a lo- there're other species that_ where people just don't know the status, so sorry i can't answer that... i mentioned before that the bluebird was, uh... not endangered in terms of small n- numbers, and certainly not a harvestable, species but it was s- something, a species that people really liked, esthet- esthetically, and they may have declined, because of pesticide use, they may have declined because people no longer were using wooden fence posts, and they didn't have old o- orchard or- apple orchards with the how- howa- (hollow) that woodpeckers would make in trees, and a, very big effort across the country, uh not that it was a national effort but, lots of people pitched in, really has seen a tremendous return of bluebirds they're now, you know, we haven't_ it's not that we've seen them a lot, but when we're in open country, if there're bluebird houses around, you find bluebirds. so they have really, um, thrived so to speak on, relatively minor attention, uh from people. the Purple Martin is another one. um, their numbers, though, seem to have declined and really not recovered, but there's been a lot of efforts, to manage Purple Martins, we for a long time at the station had a big, Purple Martin colony, but they have declined here because of changes in habitat, they like an open, a very open area near water, and down by the beach and the cabins here, um, you know forty fifty years ago, this was, totally open, and now the trees have grown up and, it's just not a, a habitat that appeals to them, but this is a species that, um, people like to have around so it was really for esthetic reasons that people found ways to manage them. well the next, stage, in um, in conservation, that progressed after this all this, emphasis on single-species, endangered-species management and and management for harvest, is the concern about, um ecosystem or, regional management or, um, uh habitat management on a on a much larger scale wi- with multiple species, and this Scarlet Tanager is a symbol, of large blocks of forest, and people who are monitoring songbirds began to report declines in a number of species around the country, and, they were declines, primarily of species that were, required large chunks of forest, and, people who were doing the studies and monitoring, were able to point out how, forests were being increasingly fragmented and just disappearing in areas. and then there was another camp of people who said well, you know it's really not that, it's not loss of breeding habitat, look at the changes that have occurred, in the winter. in, primarily in, Central America, in some cases in South America, and in others just in, in southern coastal regions, um of the United States, so, this, problem of, songbird decline you've_ i mean i can't imagine you haven't, seen something on T-V you haven't talked about it in classes, or you haven't read about it but it's you know where, the titles are Another Silent Spring or Where Have All the Songbirds Gone or, uh the Mystery of the Missing Migrants they're all these kind of catchy titles, and, this really spurred on, groups, uh agencies like the Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service, a lot of the private, nongovernment organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, poured, millions of dollars into figuring out what was going on, with forest songbirds, why, are they declining, are they really in_ declining, is it happening in the tropics, is it happening in the, in the breeding, um areas, and, what is, making the decline happen. so some of the species that were focused on were Scarlet Tanagers, the Ovenbird was_ is one that is, known to, well it appears to prefer large, blocks of undisturbed forest, but it's also found in marginal lands as well. the Rose-breasted Grosbeak, mature deciduous forest, and the woodpeckers, all depend on, uh older forests or most of them depend on, older forests for food and for nesting. these are not songbirds but they've been, included in the studies. so, um, there're now, um there's been enough time that, if you look, the result of all the money that went into the forest songbird work is that if you pick up any journal, that publishes on birds, you will find a huge chunk of the papers are on forest songbird studies, so much money went into it, people, dropped their, research efforts that they'd been pursuing for years just to go for the money, and we now know a lot about, forest songbird issues, but a lot of things are still not resolved, there are no nationwide trends for declines in particular species there are regional declines, and some species may be declining one place and increasing another. we do know that, habitat fragmentation is an important issue birds, that nest near forest edges or any kind of habitat edge, where, um predators are gonna be using these areas have lowered reproductive success. birds in intact, forests in the center have higher reproductive success. they also are not, those in the center are not exposed to cowbird, um parasitism, as_ in as great a frequency, um so we know that those things are influencing, uh bird populations. um, it's not real clear about what's happening in the wintering grounds there's some areas where there's tremendous loss, of habitat, in other areas where the habitat has been lost there are some species that, seem to be benefitting. so these programs are all, um, many of them are still continuing, and as with any piece of research you open one door and you open fifty more. so, uh the, forest songbird work i think will continue, uh for quite some time we're still, you know getting a huge amount of information. um the original money is not there but a lot of these programs are set up and, this is a place where you could get, um jobs i- quite easily in, in the summer, based on your, experience with the class. i also mentioned the, of course i talked about my work with Piping Plovers, so the effort now, in many conservation, uh studies is to take a bigger approach. look at multiple species, think about the landscape, um think about, conservation issues, from a much, larger perspective, and including, human interests, because without, getting human interests into the picture, you can never, um resolve uh most conservation, issues. okay i'm just gonna finish, with those species that are now superabundant, overabundant, and just say a few things about what these problems are and where things may be headed. this doesn't sound like a real, exciting direction, we're thinking about future directions, and in fact, coming up with conservation plans, at an ecosystem level, and regional level, for birds for multispecies is extremely challenging and that's gonna occupy, people working on conservation issues for a long time. endangered species still need, to be held by the wing so to speak. we do all that very intensive management with Piping Plovers so it's not to say that, single-species management is out, game species will demand, a lot of attention and time, simply because of money, but these are kind of, you know new problems on the horizon. species like Red-winged Blackbird and starling have been around for a long time, of course this isn't exotic, and they do, billions of dollars worth of damage to crops. during the winter we don't really see that here, but they migrate down throughout south, south, eastern U-S, and there are a lot of, uh control programs to try and keep the numbers down. the Red-winged Blackbird um, i've heard it reported as being the most abundant land bird now that the Passenger Pigeon is gone, uh in North America and on top of it, a problem species. the Mute Swan we've talked about this before, it's appealing people like to have it around but it also, um is responsible for environmental degradation, um destruction of the, substrate and vegetation in wetlands and they'd be challenging loons on their nesting platforms, um, here is a species that, really isn't superabundant or overabundant, but it's increasing in numbers, it hasn't reached anything like the Canada Goose, it it may be a concern right now, it basically is doing its own thing and there may be some_ a few local control issues but, i just wanted to point this out, we've got a lot of these that are kind of, you know on the fringe, um that people wonder about, you know, whether they're gonna be, uh what their future will be. the Brown-headed Cowbird, has definitely increased, it was a bird of the plains, probably followed the bison. and because it followed bison capturing insects, it could not be tied down to a territory, and evolved, the, um, the behavior pattern of not building a nest, it's an obligate nest parasite, does not cannot build a nest, lays its eggs in other birds' nests, and then it moves on, and the other birds then, um, raise the cowbird young, and it's been very successful, when Michigan was cleared, prior to that cowbirds were not in Michigan probably, they moved way up into Michigan, with the clearing of the forest and followed in with the farmlands so the distribution of cowbirds has changed. next week on the twenty-ninth we're going to have one of the world's experts on cowbirds here, giving a talk at the, required lecture the Hann lecture, he's also um, probably gonna go out in the field with us and has offered just to meet and talk with you folks, and so i'm gonna work with him to come up with an idea of, kind of a general lecture about, cowbirds and, why cowbirds are interesting, so you know, you have that to look forward to. um, this is my, special species of interest as a, overabundant species you've heard me talk about this the Double-crested Cormorant, in the state of Michigan a big worry because, um, they are increasing, and where they're increasing um sports fishing is very very popular and is a tremendous source of revenue for people, and there's tremendous concern that cormorants are eating, the sports fish. perch in particular. the studies do not, show, that that have been done on (diets) do not show that the cormorants have, big impact, that's hard to discuss with people when they're fishing and they see, cormorants zinging around their boat, catching fi- fish faster than they are, um the cormorants have gone from about, seven hundred pairs, uh twenty years ago to over fifty thousand in the Great Lakes, and they're increasing, everywhere, and this is probably, in response to, banning of, D-D-T and also, a big thing is a change, a conversion of the cotton, crop in the southern U-S to, uh catfish farming, because now the birds have a great source of food in the winter, so mortality is lower, juvenile mortality is greatly lowered, the young they're breeding when they're one instead of four years old, and so on. what will the future be? there's a depredation order, anyone working within an aquaculture facility, can shoot cormorants if they see them catching or about to catch a fish, and, local, um communities are pushing for local cormorant control. i don't, you know i really don't know, where this is gonna go but, Fish and Wildlife Service is under, tremendous pressure, one phone rings, from a congressman who says, get rid, of those damn birds, and the next phone, call is from an animal rights group, saying you touch those birds and you'll be in court, so the poor person who has to answer that phone has, got jangled nerves. Betsy. are they an exotic species? nope, these are native to North America, um so are they protected under these are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and, um, so they have to, there is a special, what's called a depredation order, that is signed by the Secretary of the Interior, that allows the har- you know the, shooting of, birds that are damaging, human property. um, anyway, that's that's a story, to watch. this is a story though that i really want you to watch because, this is going to make big national news, on and on. it's already started but i haven't really seen any, big articles yet. this is a Snow Goose. the Snow Goo- Geese, nest up in the arctic, around Hudson's Bay James Bay, by the millions. and they're grazers like the other geese, they feed on vegetation. in the winter, they go down to the southern U-S and, they're in many places they're on wildlife refuges, but they go into farmers', um, in agricultural lands and they feed a lot on, new rice new wheat all kinds of, um, uh, typically what you'd think of as kind of short grass crops. they've been protected, there is a hunting season, on this species, and, the numbers have, s- began to increase slowly slowly, and now, the numbers are so great, that, this is probably, the only, uh vertebrate species, whose impact can be seen from satellite, because their impact on the vegetation, in the tundra, is unbelievable i've seen the satellite photos, and um, they have completely destroyed, the vegetation, um that they require, to to feed on, and it's you know it's basically down to the bare soil, so this means that, the whole tundra environment is changing so what do they do well they shift their nesting patterns, um in response to this, there is no predator that can even begin to make a dent their most, um, feared predator a- is the Arctic Fox, well, if you've got, millions of birds, even, hundreds of Arctic Foxes are not going to eve- even begin to make a dent, so, and then there's the concern of, with these birds where they're going in the winter. some areas there doesn't seem to be a big impact where they're spread out but others, um there is, so Fish and Wildlife Service is in, in huge debates, um with Ducks Unlimited and all the, other agencies and noncon- and nongovernment conservation groups, to try and make, um, a decision, that will lead to, um, a solution to the problem, and one thing that's very difficult, a logical solution would be, increase what's called the bag limit increase the number of birds, that can be taken by a hunter. well, they already have done that, and people, are not harvesting, at a higher level, you know people don't want twenty, Snow Geese, or whatever the level is. another possibility is that they will lengthen the season, of harvest and, probably the next step will be a spring harvest. whether or not, these will have the impact that, they want in terms of bringing the numbers down is, you know it's not known, because the, the numbers are so large, um that, it's it's just, difficult to make, uh predictions as to how popula- the entire population would respond, uh to different harvest levels, but this is very contentious, from groups who don't want the birds touched, to people who are concerned about, the, um, quality of the arctic environment is this affecting other species will this have global implications on, all kinds of things water quality and, and um just the, um watershed, patterns and so on in in, in the arctic, so it's a, a fascinating, um problem, i'm glad i don't have to deal with it, and it's something, that i predict this fall you're gonna start seeing, more in the newspaper, so you can remember that you heard about it here first. okay i think, that may be my last one, it is. and um, anybody have specific questions? or nonspecific questions...? yeah. how reliable are those, bird atlases (just in terms of) going out and (xx) well um, she wants to know how reliable the bird atlases are with groups of people going out. how reliable were you folks this morning? um, you know with any set, with any data set, the longer you do it, um, the more accurate your patterns are going to be. um, you can, you recognize that with a group of amateurs that you are, you are_ that there're gonna be errors, with the group that's doing the breeding birds survey, there there're gonna be errors, but the overall pattern and just the, um, the strength of the numbers in terms of the data, that's what really, um, counts and i think, that the, that the patterns, are quite accurate. i know, one um, for some species if_ they're not gonna be, because we just don't know enough they're too secretive. um, now there was one that i looked at, and i was kind of surprised, can't remember what it was, um that the distribution was kind of as thin as it was, but if you look under say Least Bitterns there's not gonna be much information that's because people aren't out in the marshes, looking for Least Bitterns, um, and for the breeding birds survey, that's where people are driving a route, well you're not gonna have a good record, of Caspian Tern distribution, they're out on islands out in northern Lake Michigan, but that information is recorded, so, breeding birds survey, info that's then converted to a map, it is very, um, it's not at all accurate for some species. but for a lot of species i think it shows, you know very good (regional) patterns. we just have, you know we just, we, people, just have to keep, and will continue to refine the methodology of, yes RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  	1
LES485MG006.json	today, what i'd like to do, is to finish up our sort of, first seven weeks of the course which are taking eight and a half weeks, of, of the... interaction of classical fields, with, atoms or molecules... and later on today we'll start, some aspects of the quantized nature of the field. the assignment for next time looks long, but it's actually much shorter than all, all of our other assignments, because, we're now entering into an area, where... it's not so, much my area of expertise so that, i can't make up such long problems, uh, hopefully educat- problems that are educational but, these are more standard s- problems which, are fairly simple and take only a page rather than, three and four pages so even though it looks longer, it's really, one of the shortest assignments of the, of the semester. the material, actually on that again, the material that we're going to be starting to use, is really, covered pretty well in, Mandel and Wolf so that, starting with the quantized field i think that if you use the text and i i emailed you, various sections that we're covering, i think that'll help you and you'll be able to go ahead. in fact one of the homework problems i think is actually solved at the end of the Wolf, and also, the first volume of Cohen-Tannoudji's book, on uh Introduction to Electrodynamics, interaction of atoms with fields is on reserve at at the uh, science library, that's also, covers this the material. but it's also covered in almost any, basic quantum optics book. but before we get there let's start and just_ i wanted to finish up again, what we had last time on the Ramsey fringes. the physical experiment here and developed by Ramsey, is one in which you have something an atomic beam, that passes through two field regions. and the idea here is to get a line shape eventually, that will, be narrower in frequency than, you would've, had if you did, C-W spectroscopy, and you would've been limited by the transit time the amount of time the atom stays in the, field interaction regime. here we're assuming that the atom really, doesn't spend very much time in the field interaction regime we're assuming short pulses, but that there's a time interval between pulses, which, in the atomic rest frame is just L over V-X, where V-X is the longitudinal velocity, and V-Z is the transverse velocity or V-perpendicular, in this case. so the idea of the experiment is you detune the laser field, from the, atomic transition by a certain amount, you send the atoms through, and you measure the population of the atoms, just as they exit, the field region, you can do this in a number of ways field ionization, or just probing it with another, if it's in the R-F domain with another radio frequency field. does everyone understand the experiment? you do that for both fields right? excuse me? you check after each no you check only after the second field. only after the second only after the second field you check for the population. alright? so just right here, you check for the population. now what's physically going on here? (between) yes (between) the (out) field it_ both fields have the same (between). oh. alright? normally the way you would do this, is you would take this field, and send it down via some uh corner cube or something else and get it. i- i- i- in the case of optics in the case of R-F you would have two cavities, that you would be sending the atoms through and you would have to weight the cavities to, to uh, make sure that the cavities have a, fixed relative phase. so this is what's happening, and we wanna measure the population so physically, what's going on here? this is what_ you can_ once you understand that then i think uh things are are fairly straightforward. what you're doing what you're going to be measuring here, is, essentially a difference in phase. (xx)? the first pulse actually starts a clock. you can think of it as starting a clock pressing down on a s- on a stopwatch and starting a clock, and the second pulse then, stops the clock   well you got 'em both alright? atom field um... (that) length? uh think of it in terms of time it's easier, how much phase does it, go through...? its frequency is big omega, so it's just omega omega T omega times T, big T. and how much phase does the atom, the dipole that you've created go through? if its natural frequency is little omega? little omega times T little omega times T. so what's the difference in phase?  so there's no Doppler phase there is a Doppler phase we have to look at it and see what's involved with a Doppler, phase. which we did that last time but i'll redo it again, today. now any question on the physics once the physics once you got the physics then the rest is, is is mathematics but it's i- it's really, a- and there are some, important applica- implications of the Doppler shift as well, so we have to look at that. alright everybody any questions on the physics? alright? stop_ start and stop of a clock, so that last time we calculated in fact what W is, right after the second pulse, and that's_ we're interested in rho two two, or W, it doesn't make a difference really. and W, is just sine A-one sine A-two and those are the areas of the pulse, E-to-the-minus-gamma-T, cosine delta-bar T, where delta-bar but aren't you gonna record that when you make the measurement y- it's a background so it affects so how do you get rid of it? i mean, you, have to have  yeah two, you mean it'd just be constant? not constant if it was monoenergetic it would be a? delta function, it would be delta V-X minus whatever the, speed of the beam is, alright? monoenergetic means you have all the, atoms have the same longitudinal velocity, alright? now out of a thermal source you don't get that out of a supersonic source you can do a lot better, and you can use laser cooling techniques actually to get close to that. so let's, i just took a simple distribution, for the speed along the beam V-X-squared, typically in a thermal beam it might be V-X-cubed, times E-to-the-minus-V-X-squared just moves it out a little bit. but this is just a function that's peaked, at some value related to U-X. so we have to calculate, the why they in the Doppler now they have, the exponential, um, Us, um U-X, uh, U, is that? this is U-X-squared. alright that's, gives us the most, that's related to the most probable, speed along the beam but here w- we have we have U-squared not i know but this is a beam you_ uh that's in a that's in a cell, where U-X-squared average equals U-Y-squared average equals U-Z-squared average mhm yeah okay mm, yeah they'll just cancel each other out what are you telling us with_ you're asking us, what that number means or what are you asking us with in other words this number's ten-to-the-fourth, but we still have to integrate i just took a st- a typical V-perpendicular, we still have to integrate over V-perpendicular mhm so you're saying the same thing that you said before basically with the, with the  okay how does it compare with delta? delta's not_ delta's fixed, and we'll have to deal with delta also delt- there's another phase here, that we'll have to deal with, but i want to look at this phase first. no matter what delta is it's fixed. so when we average over Vs- V-perpendicular, the signal washes out of the optical domain. so you can't do the Ramsey fringe, for these typical parameters, in the optical domain... and in fact the original experiments were done in the R-F domain, where, in the R-F domain... frequency? frequency so K changes. so K is about... it's small it's small? it's small and we can neglect it it's small we can throw it out... and that's where Lorentz originally carried out his experiments, so we're left now, with an integral, of, okay but why are we looking in the R-F domain? that_ that's where the or- we don't have to look in the R-F domain that's where the experiments were originally, carried out it's still an important domain. because the frequency standards are, are, cesium for example ground state transition, so it's a transition between, between the two hyperfine states and the ground state, which is in the radio frequency part of the spectrum. it's on the order of gigahertz. so that this is in fact the region where most standards have been, developed so far it would be better if we could get an optical standard, but we're not there yet, because of other problems. so that this, is, a way to measure, for example transitions between hyperfine states... now what if we did have a monoenergetic beam? what would this signal look like? in other words if V-X instead of being, a distribution as i, wrote it, was, just a delta function, of V-X minus some, V-X-zero? (xx) integration'd be easier? the integration would be trivial but what would we get...? let's say it was delta V-X... cosine cosine it's a cosine it looks like a cosine. um, you have a problem with the... it's not confined to a, point in space? what are you trying to determine...? what value of delta? (xx) when delta's equal to what? you wanna, you wanna use this to measure the frequency of the transition so what value of delta do you need? zero zero. well if i draw you a curve like this (xx don't know) you don't know. so in fact, you want something, that destroys all the fringes, except the? delta equals zero fringe yeah excuse me i'm not following this is it you want to measure (the delta) the uhuh why they want delta equals zero fringe? you tell me why do you want delta to equal zero? you say you want to measure the when a_ if delta equals zero, what is the frequency of the laser equal to? equal to the omega equal to the atomic atomic oh okay  g- Gaussian no it's normalized but what's the integral? one just one. and then what happens? as delta starts to, deviate from zero, you start to get oscillations and what'll happen eventually to this integral? as we integrate over it? it'll start to wash out. you have to do this integral numerically, and it's done in the notes, but it'll look something like this. how do we know that gives us the width of the? you do it, you do it numerically you can measure it, but i'm just saying, here you have a phase. when do you start losing, when does it_ when do you start getting things wash out, when the phase is of order? pi pi unity pi equals, two pi equals one, right?  okay it was two pi equals one that got me (laws) as the length gets larger and larger, what happens to the width? gets smaller smaller smaller and smaller so it looks like you have arbitrarily small width. there's only one, feature that's, that we haven't mentioned so far or i didn't put it here, we always have this so in R-F domain, the frequency will be lower when you measure it? is it only (can) measure (it) lower? you can measure R-F frequencies which are oh yeah because (xx) velocity because of the Doppler effect, the wipeout. so we have to do something clever to eliminate the Doppler effect. the big phase difference is what you're talking about, or the big phase? the big pha- the Doppler, the large Doppler phase. and you already know how to do that in some sense... how did we eliminate Doppler effects in the f- in the past? two photon, two one is the two-photon and the other in in the coherent transient domain what was it? essentially used a photon echo... right, oh right? so we have to do something similar to that. so now, the idea is... are we taking K-one and K-two to be, in opposite  to get rid of okay and what does the second pulse do essentially? i put these very close together, to indicate that we don't have to worry about what's going on here. so the second pulse just gives us another, the same type of factor. the only thing that changes is what? it's K-two cosine  delta equals zero (xx)   okay by taking K-one and K-two to be   is there a reason why we_ the decay factor is different, here than it was in the R-F? it's the same factor except we have two Ts oh okay alright? okay we're always dealing with the dipoles, between the, pulses. now, these these experiments were carried out in the, eighties, and then later on uh Christian Borde, gave, an interpretation of these experiments in terms of atom interferometry. now this is a somewhat controversial area. and, which, i've been involved with a little bit and Dor- Boris Dubetsky who works with me, is uh much more emotional about these issues. and i'll come back to it in just a second and tell you why why what the controversy is, in terms of atom interferometers. you could think of this now, if we remember those diagrams in terms of recoil, we could think of these as, two atoms going along different paths, because of recoil, and then recombining. so, in that context, this could be, as an atom interferometer. but to get this result did we ever use, anything related to quantization of the center of mass motion? not at all. so in_ ultimately or, fundamentally, this result is not related to quantization of the center of mass motion, and it's not related to matter wave interferometry in other words, treating the motion of the center of mass motion_ center of mass motion quantum mechanically. you can still use it as an interferometer, but it's what we call an internal what we term, an internal state it depends on the fact that you have, different internal states, and you're looking at the interference between those states. and that'll become a little clearer in just a second. so this is, a way of, doing Ramsey fringes doing interferometry, as well, because no no so you can measure phase changes due to gravitational effects, or rotation, and this can serve as a rotation center, or a gravitational sensor. and the experiment's already been done, in which that was_ uh, those were measured... the question is, is it possible to, to build an interferometer, when we're not so much interested in standards, so we're not trying to measure a frequency, but we want to have a very long baseline of time, so we can carry out an experiment over a long time, to get a higher precision... if we use the dipole moment, what are we always limited by? the decay? the decay of the dipole, (sine state) so what's a long time you said we need a long time what do you mean? long time the longer the better but let's say we c- want to get up to seconds, or tens of seconds   the ground state. so we have to build an interferometer of this type, that just depends on the, ground state. so let me just sketch again how you can do that you absorb from this beam, and then emit into this beam. how much momentum do we transfer to the atom?   two-K two H-bar K, remember because, when you (absorption) you change the sign if we absorb from this beam, and then emit it into this beam of course, then that thing would've been zero, but by doing it this way how much do we transfer? two two K-V, and we can be either in the excited state or the ground state. if we do this twice how much do we transfer? four four K-V six K-V eight K-V any even, even frac- even uh, power of K-V. but let's just look at the two K-V to see what happens, lowest order of perturbation. so now, and let's assume we're back in the ground state. where will the diagram_ where will the line_ what line should i draw now since we've got two K-V of momentum, what should i draw? a line going up at two (xx) two K-V what is you_ what is doing in the ground state? well that's a that's a term remember you go, just do it in perturbation theory you start in the ground state, you go up to the excited state with one field and back down to  so, i understand your (by your) picture i think i understand what you're talking about, well, you're talking about both fields acting at the same time but no it's  yeah   th- these are two, this is a standing wave pulse and a second standing wave pulse.  so you're looking at one standing wave this is just the first standing wave. okay alright this is just the first standing wave. u- so you're saying we stay in the ground state but we we  okay and now,  that's the second pulse? that's the second pulse this is at time T... from scattering by creating a modulatio- a spatial modulation. two K dot R. and then R goes like R plus V-T. that's two K-V-T. and then what've we done by the second pulse? we've? rephased, that modulation... and now you're sensitive to very small effects because you can, use long time scales. however there's one catch, okay when gamma is when the system was, open well, the diagram you've drawn, looks like we're only looking at rho one one. well you have your rho two two as well. yeah okay that's my  always in the past we're always looked at, the difference and now here it's the same thing we're still looking at the difference. where's the second_ where is there a line for the second state? in the second state? we have to_ we have to be uh... to to go to a three level? now i hafta (xx)  so i guess my let me think about that my my real question then is, if this does i-  well if i i no i didn't give you a complete picture   yeah okay how do you say, consider recoil, it's a, it's open?  one that's equal to one.   oh yeah which way does what recoil? the atom the atom you absorb radiation this way,  mm (xx) it emits it in a lot of different directions so we can get a kick another way. so that this condition, oh  two mm how many H-bar Ks? two two? two. so you create a coherence, in momentum states. you started by saying this can be used for an atom  you had to cancel (xx)  if the whole thing accelerates, wouldn't it if it_ it's in a gravitational field oh   more fringes meaning that the, two ground states are sort of in phase for longer? it's it's that we measure this as a function of some detuning or as a function of, of some, time separation between the pulses. we vary this time separation. alright? and then we'll see that uh things are periodic with omega K t- the ra- the recoil frequency times time. so each time you move by one over the recoil frequency you get a new maximum or whatever the pattern repeats. so if you can go out a million waves, you could do much better in determining the recoil frequency than if you have one wave. alright? the precision is essentially one over the time of the experiment no alright. uh, of course i'll do anything to avoid starting the next topic which is a little fifth fifth grade? where did you where did you first learn about quantizing the field? um don't remember quantum   everything else is quantized (when) (xx)  the classical field doesn't explain everything? and uh that's sometimes used as a reason and what k- doesn't the classical field explain? what's the first   what's the first thing you learn?  no it's what is the first evidence for a quantized field that most people learn? uh, the photoelastic, er  yeah and of course that's known, that uh you can explain the photoelectric effect totally without any, reference to, photons... alright? Compton scattering, when you, think of the particles as, photons. but the Compton scattering experiments, the Compton scattering calculations were done with classical fields. in fact most calculations and most of your life, you're dealing with, classical fields and you can describe things using classical fields, when the number of photons is, very  measure it n- no (make one) you don't know if you measure it you you can then you don't have anything that's right, so you  and you excite it you excite it (xx) and you wait a little while. now what's emitted in that case? how can take one? how can you take one atom? mm mm alright? so you have the_ some atoms in a host and you can just focus in on that one atom... and you can ways of checking we'll talk about it alright? so what happens then what does that atom do? what's the normal nomenclature? emits a emits a photon. well that's not quite, true either. my, my advisor was Willis Lamb, and, his point was that he said he d- it's not that he's against the word photons but he thinks it's, that people should have to apply for a license to use the word and he said most people wouldn't get it, a mess? problems. alright? even if you take a spherical cavity, which is a nice system for using angular momentum states, to quantize the field, what will you find when you try to quantize those states? it's like quantizing in a spherical cavity? you get Bessel functions you get, all these combinations of Bessel functions, and, things are not the waves are not transverse, you get it's like, you're_ oh someone was talking about Jackson, this is the modes inside of a spherical cavity. if you take a box, then things get a little easier, (xx) whatever (xx) whatever the modes are of that cavity, mm so quantize field quantize the mode this is the way that you never run into trouble. if you look at the classical prop- for example if you have a beam splitter which we'll do later on... you should include as your system, include the beam splitter, in your system, and quantize the field, get the classical modes of the field, with the beamsplitter in... and we'll see how to do that, and then you don't run into any problem. and then you associate with each, classical mode, some quantized mode. and that's what we'll be doing. so that's the pep talk, the philosophy and then i, go through this. most of this is in the notes i'm not gonna_ it's_ as boring harmonic oscillator harmonic oscillator P-squared over two M, plus one half K-X-squared. so it's tempting to think, that, i can assign one of these, E for example to momentum, and X, or X to momentum, and, B to, E to X-Q and B to momentum, and it will look like a harmonic oscillator. well you can't quite do that because the, commutation relations for the field, are not the same, as the commuta- or the Poisson brackets for the field are not the same, as the Poisson brackets for X and P, in the harmonic oscillator. but for certain boundary conditions it almost works out, that way. so the idea instead of doing that is to use a little trick. is to use some combinations of E and B, and then see if we can get the Hamiltonian written, in a new form that also looks, quite, familiar to you. so this is what we'll do. and let me get the, definitions correct. so we need to take alpha... is this in Gaussian unit? no everything is stan- S-I. S-I that's the wave of the future right? even Jackson's new edition which he's writing, and what we'll also want is alpha star,   substitute you substitute in, and remember when i'm integrating over K what can i always do? i can change K to minus K, and, it doesn't change the integral, at all, so i can make that substitution when i need to. so what do you get when you substitute in? when i get the E-squared terms what do i get? i get terms like, alpha alpha-star, alpha alpha, complex conjugate, this time this complex conjugate. and what do you imagine when i add these together what about the cross terms? cancel the cross terms cancel. and what about the, contribution from E and B? you know for a for a plane wave? contribution to the energy from the E-field and the B-field? same it's the same. so we're just gonna get a factor of two, which will cancel this, factor of two, and we end up, the details of, i think you need a C as well there's a C, yeah, let's see but i'm going to wanna leave it in some type of symmetrized form, so that when i try to quantize the system, i'm able to quantize it... alright? so this just comes now, and this is dot really it just substituted to the next (wave) alright? it's just equal mm, K cross B I-C-squared-K the partial'd be I-C-squared-K cross B minus I-K cross C minus I-K cross C minus I-K cross C dot-squared-E? no remember use the (back cav, row) alright you don't have to er- it's K times, K dot E. but what is K dot E? it's, zero. zero, because K is perpendicular and then you get minus E times, K dot K, but K dot K is, kappa is just zero? K. K dot kappa kappa's in the direction of K. oh so it's just K. so what_ without going through all the details what does this term give you just back?  and what does this term give you? E K cross B. E (xx) no K cross B. so we're back to what we started with. kappa cross B and E. and what's the multiplication factor? it's just C-K... and what is C-K? omega? omega. so this is just equal to, um... i have to put I H-bar, so this is ex- excuse me?  we haven't yet we haven't yet quantized remember, this is just_ everything is totally classical now. each, B and E, remember since we're in_ using, periodic boundary conditions what modes are possible? mm, it's, all a- all plane waves, so each K corresponds, and, we actually hafta introduce some polarization, each K corresponds to how many set_ independent modes essentially? two two wu- you have two independent polarizations. these are the number of modes? this is just a normalization factor. remember it could've been anything. if you're not happy with this, keep the N in the equations all the way through, and at the end you can choose anything you want. i'm just choosing it this way. so if we put that in, what do we find for H? L   over L two pi N-X, over L. so we're inter- we're interested in the integral mhm but what is delta K? two pi over L it's just two pi over L we just change N by one. (xx) two pi over L-cubed, and we take the sum. so H now it's the H-bar omega um J H-bar omega J J   alpha J star.  the Hamiltonian but what does that equal...? mm alpha alpha J dot  these are what not Ps and Qs but they're? canonical variables. so we see that, alpha J, I H  so what do you change to A, A is uh alpha? A would change from the classical variables alpha now oh mm harmonic  do the, raising and lowering yeah and how did you do that y- that's right. how did you do the raising and lowering you remember? this is something to remember that's why i wanna remind you of this if you don't remember it. what do you mean? how did you get the raising and lower operators? what did you consider? the outer (xx) levels the outer (xx) levels or even the phase (xx)  (partial A-P) what's the commutator of H with A? let's take a single mode, (xx) yeah (xx) just do it oh it's A dagger, first of all a half commutes with A, you don't have to worry about that. mm squared? A dagger A, comma A what is that? it's been a long time  it's been a long time at least uh... remember how to do this you take one (xx) out to this side, you take this out to this side, yeah yeah   A A  so it's  alright? so what does that mean? if i look at H A, minus A N (xx) (xx) minus A, operating on N... but what is H, operating on N? parameter H bar omega N plus a half. mm hm so if i end up i look, and i find  A-N is an eigenstate of H with an eigenvalue of N minus one N minus one. so what does that mean? that means A-N number (xx) i get number gives me, the number operator N, so this just gives me N. so that (xx) positive. number states number states. alright? in the case of the radiation field what are these states called now? photon states? photons... N means the number of photons in a given mode of the field... so this is the quantization procedure you get a classical, box, you find the classical modes, and to each classical mode, you, essentially, apply, an A-H-bar omega A dagger A in the Hamiltonian... so let's stop here, we now, you can review this if you've forgotten it before next lecture, but i_ next time what i'll do is i'll start to talk about some properties of these, photon states, and we'll talk about what are called coherent states, i'm not going to do the phase operator in any detail. the phase operator's in the notes, and Mandel knows more about pha- a lot more about phase operators than i do. and he's worked on that extensively so if you look in Mandel and Wolf, he has both, which i'll talk about the Pegg-Barnett, definition of the phase operator and, what he's developed himself which are called operational, measures of the phase operator, which, disagree somewhat from the, Pegg-Barnett but there's a discussion in his book, about that. after, that i'll talk about coherent states, and then we'll talk about two photon coherent states or squeeze states, as they're called. okay? so does your_ well, this is just a side question you were talking about excuse (xx) well one question at a time alright? you were talking about how uh, the uh, your advisor said that Lamb said that you need a license t- right, (xx) has to do with_ does that have to do with coherent states? that has to_ well the coherent states are strange states what it has to do with_ people talk about photons yeah yeah oh okay alright oh alright uh yeah how do you got C equal square root of N? here? yeah well A dagger A is just N oh operating on this, alright? we know what A... A dagger A is just, remember, this is H  oh uh huh okay um yeah homework now, we're gonna relate the raising and lowering operators to D and B, next time? next time we'll just write_ remember we've already done that. because, alright it's off off the board now but we wrote, we wrote E in terms of alpha and alpha star. yeah but the E and B there were still classical they were kind of a_ all_ the only thing we had to do is replace the uh, alpha by A, and the alpha star by A dagger and they still_ i mean nothing really changes between the, sort of classical B and E no that's how we go from them there there are changes but that's how we go from a classical E  (xx) haven't people tried to actually, tried to get (into) the vacuum entity, experimentally? well you can never measure the infinite (xx you're) always measure differences right? right cuz (xx) snapshot but utilize the vacuum you can utilize the vacuum but that that's you know this is all, that's all hype i mean, you're inside a cavity you have vacuum fields and, you can see the effects, on an atom, and you send it in you get a force on an atom and things like that, so, the Casimir fill- forces are usually right right oh right right right and that's what- that's what's  uh are_ can you, can you spend any time or are we gonna spend any time talking about that because, that's what i, that's the piece i i seem to be missing to understand why coherent_ you mentioned that, coherent states have to do with the absorption, i think well at least we talked about it in in, field theory or whatever we call it, the quantum mechanics (xx) it was confusing me at first why, why you'd be interested in an operator that doesn't have eigenvalues... you mean coherent states, that's   well maybe it'll be more_ maybe_ maybe it'll make more sense  yeah okay give you the  uh yeah, that's what i need help with,  that's that's the, that's the uh (xx) bye 	1
TOU999JU030.json	okay. so. i got a couple quick_ please listen to me please please please listen to me please listen to me, thank you. i got a couple quick administrative things to go through real quick. not only did i have to ask you about this English Language Institute thing, but i also have to ask_ guys move in come on come on come on. this is ridiculous. i'm not gonna shoot you guys i promise i'm not gonna shoot anybody. now, couple quick things, first thing that the c- campus tour is my favorite part of the entire orientation thing. this is where i get off the most, i absolutely get a big kick out of this because i think i give a pretty decent tour, and i've been doing tours actually for the last two years. so anyway, basically i have a really good time giving a tour. if you do not want to be here, i don't want you to be here and the reason is, because, i don't want you to cramp my style i don't want you to cramp anybody else that wants to actually be here, so if you don't want to be here that's fine. i won't hold it against you it's just like that English Lang- Language Institute thing, that's okay if you don't wanna be here cuz you got something else to do you got another agenda please go. because... hey, if you're gonna be like all pissed off that we made you come, it's not a big deal i don't really care. so honest to God if you guys don't wanna be here i'm not gonna be pissed at you. so if you wanna leave, be back at eight o'clock at the same, um auditorium that we were at this uh morning, for our_ for the comedy troupe thing. can you tell us why you have a water gun? i can tell you why i have a water gun. now the reason i have a water gun is because not so that i can shoot you guys  you have like the smallest water gun though yeah you do. you really do really? um yes. you like  okay. i end up winning, nine times out of  so anyway, as i was saying, you guys (xx)  you gotta warn us. no they're not gonna get you they're gonna_ nine times out of ten they're gonna hit me. they might go after you guys which is why you guys gotta back me up well if you'd told us ahead of time i could've brought a squirt gun. well i blew it i know i'm such a jerk. anyway, how long is this? long it's gonna go to about eight o'clock so little over an hour. not even cuz actually we're gonna hang out on the Diag for frisbee later. now the next question is, do you want a campus_ all-campus tour, an all off-campus tour or do you want a campus and off-campus combo tour which i happen to think is the best combo deal going. (xx) oh combo deal wow. any objections to the combo tour? no. okay. alright. with that, we're gonna go. so if you wanna sneak off, you know (do it) really discreetly (xx) so then the other thing is that i got a lot of candy why do i have a lot of candy cuz i'm gonna ask a lot of questions during this tour anybody that answers any questions about the tour, is gonna get, a little bit of, Starburst love. now, you guys all (know) that really cheap liquor we go to North Campus (for) tomorrow right? uh are you an engineer? yes. (xx) (first of all i can't hear) (xx) no, no no no. cuz um, now i actually_  (is it?) it is. it is posh, it was mostly an upperclassmen dorm (xx) last year (it was) converted completely on my thing when i got here it said, (xx) four percent upperclassmen. yeah well it's not like that anymore they changed it. um so if you got_ and you got a pretty good pick. rooms are a decent size and, it's just really, cool to look at. School of Business Administration. well there you go. (everybody) at the same time couldn't figure out who it was, that is the School of Business Administration who's interested in going to the School of Business? me good luck. it is tough. kick-ass. it's a squirrel. they're rugged around here i'm not kidding they'll kick your butts. if you look through here through these little trees over there you will see two big nice Greek pillars. those Greek pillars were imported by the School of Architecture Dean. he thought it was so cool, and, he was so rich that he decided to import those two pillars himself, so that the School of Architecture students which was housed in Lorch Hall which is behind, uh those two pillars... he thought he would bring 'em in so that they could see what Greek architecture's really like and (how) you know_ how're they gonna get these two pillars there? you can see they're_ the one on the left is segmented off very clearly broken into smaller pieces, that's how they got it here. so, there you  they are actually put together like that yes  right i know, but (it_) that's how they were there_ that was the   i'm glad to hear it. alright. hey you know what? and for putting me in_  okay. (xx) oh. it's my (favorite) building on campus. (beautiful) (xx) (classes) (xx) what that? (like two buildings) (xx) oh underneath? yeah. oh, (it's not) a greenhouse what is it  (xx) Law Library (xx) yeah. okay so this is the second part of the tour and one of the first parts of the off-campus tour. everybody's gonna look over here where the two, older guys are looking at you? that is Dominick's. Dominick's is the largest hub of underage drinking, ever to be imagined on University of Michigan campus. basically what happens there is that you get into a line, somebody with an I-D goes up there, orders, big pitcher of sangria, everybody's, maybe familiar with sangria maybe not probably shouldn't be, anyway, everybody knows what sangria is you go up to sangria guy, i want a pitcher of sangria. so he hands you one glass, and a pitcher of sangria. now, is one person really gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria? no. so that's why that person brings the entire pitcher and one glass back to the table where there's twelve friends who all can't, get in and shouldn't be there in the first place, are all gonna suck down this big pitcher of sangria. if you want more I-D_ you_ you want more glasses you're supposed to have more I-Ds. but, i've seen people drink straight out of the pitcher and i don't understand what the mentality is because honest to God like if you_ one person is gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria now sangria's pretty dilute. but if you're gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria i'm sorry you're not walking out of the joint so i don't understand (xx) Law Library. Law Library. who all said Law Library? right there Alex, (xx) not have access to it?  you do have access to part of it. the dumpy part of it (though) right? ohh (you're getting) good and (i know where the (xx) are sitting) cuz there's (snow) in (lots of) (xx) that's stupid well you are really bitter aren't you. you're really bitter. (xx) good try (xx) i've always wanted to go down there. that is incorrect. that is incorrect that's  they lied why can't we go down there? alright so here's the story about this building, as s- so many people are so impatient to hear about. this building is the Law Library. it was built in the mid-eighteen-hundreds by a name, by a name. by a man by the name of William Cook. William Cook was an incredibly rich law professor that went to the University of Michigan and taught here, and he decided hey let's just donate about oh i don't know about twenty million dollars that i had back in the mid-eighteen-hundreds which is a fat check, still now but was a fat- even fatter check back then, to the University of Michigan to build this law school he wanted to build it after the Stanford_ er this the_ the Yales the Harvards you know the really nice Ivy League posh places right and you can see, i mean it must've cost a lot cuz all those things are hand carved up there you get the shield right there the crest and you got all these little pillars that are hand carved blah blah blah, and he said two things have to happen before i... are gonna_ am gonna give you all this money. one, the whole building the whole thing's gotta be done by the time i die. secondly if you're gonna add on to any part of this, then you have to guarantee that it has to be done in the same style with the same brick. as, it was done now. so they're like okay. well that's cool. so they worked their butts off to get it done before he died and he was really old but unfortunately he died just before they finished it, sucks really bad about two years boom he's dead, they hadn't finished it yet, and the second thing is when the University of Michigan decided to add t- on to it in the nineteen sixties, they didn't have enough money, to add on to it because the price of brick went from about six dollars a brick to sixty dollars a brick so they couldn't afford to do it so what'd they do? dug a big hole in the ground didn't use any bricks and went underground. this is what you're leaning over right now. into the Law Library which is down and to your left you can see (xx) but, that's basically what it is. you cannot get i- get down there unless you are a law student, you can go down the stairs and you can stand there and they'll swipe your card and if it doesn't say you're a law student,  oh yeah. oh yeah. is that another group over there? what's that? where? Aaron don't play me.   (xx) alright. we will go to a restroom right now. okay cuz i've gotta_ i'll catch up (xx)   uh oh alright okay. alright this is Eric_ this is Eric's group Eric really gets made fun of a lot because he has chicken legs everybody's listening in the back right, Eric gets made fun of a lot because he has chicken legs right and so what we're gonna do is as we walk around the corner i'm gonna go one two three and on three we're all gonna scream chicken legs, okay? if you don't back me up in this i'm gonna look really stupid and i'm gonna make sure you look stupid by the end of the time so please back me up on this. this is crucial. alright you guys ready? he might (scream) one two three chicken legs woo. ow he's got a bigger gun though pretty big yeah but he doesn't know how to use it. in this case size certainly does not matter. stubby stubby? (xx) yeah if you um, if you, head down these stairs, don't forget that shit.  can i get you to (xx) oh. is it not working? yeah. (xx) (description) oh_ whoops and i just_ dropping stuff. alright sure. hi Rudy so anyway, look around. okay cuz everybody comes in here, and they, look at me. i'm not the cool part of this tour okay? like this is the cool part of this tour, if you look up at all these_ all these stained glass windows and stuff like that? all the major seals in the universities around campus? are all up on these seals. there's one thousand two hundred and seventy-five lights. i counted 'em all. cuz i was really bored one day. another thing you can do you can actually take a tour of this inside area i don't know if they have 'em right up here, but they've got maps and stuff, they got maps and stuff of the inside place so you can take a tour, of this whole, r- room, and figure out what all these different things mean cuz everything everything means something else all these shields along the top there's Hebrew written over here they tell you what the Hebrew is, it's awesome it's totally cool so actually take five minutes some day and actually take the tour. you'll look like a nerd but, it's cool. is that like writing here? yeah that's writing. the uh buildings... forming this Law School, Quad blah blah blah. blah blah blah. (xx) what's that?

Cook Cook  (xx) oh really? what's that (xx) she makes little chains and, crafts out of 'em. i'm not sure what the story is. (xx) (a dorm?) yep. (xx) just about to (talk about) that too. very good.

Bollinger? something Bollinger Bollinger Lee Bollinger very good. mystery chew, mystery chew. no i wasn't mystery  (xx) oh. you got screwed then. we gotta get variety into this the next time you answer a question. (xx)  (xx) i'm not sure what they did. not since i've been here... Michigan Union A (xx) huh? (xx) oh it's a_ it's_ yeah it is pretty cool. shit it's raining. what's that? (xx) Union? yeah that's what i meant. well that's not what you said (can't you) listen? i don't wanna (wanna repeat what  M-card heaven yeah definitely, definitely, okay so the next stop on our tour is the Michigan Union. Michigan Union can't give you credit for that cuz hey there's a big sign over here that says Michigan Union. well that and   and she lives in Ann Arbor. she doesn't count she shouldn't even be on the tour cuz she's already been on it many times but i'm glad you're here anyway. anyway moving on this is the Michigan Union uh what cool thing happened on the steps of the Michigan Union? a President gave a speech. a President gave a speech which President? Kennedy. Kennedy excellent. Michael Garcia special helper ladies and gentlemen, mystery chew. anyway moving on uh Mr Kennedy gave his speech here on October fourteenth, nineteen sixty at two o'clock in the morning to introduce his idea given to him by two University of Michigan students for the Peace Corps. why did he give it at two o'clock in the morning? any theories? that's when everybody was  anybody_ (yeah) everybody's up at two o'clock in the morning. when the buses stopped going? i don't know what's that? when the buses stopped going? buses stopped moving. wrong okay so actually what happened he wanted to the bars closed. what's that? the bars closed.  if you were alive in nineteen sixty. if you were alive in nineteen sixty. Hillary came last year... yay, but i mean you know hey whatever, (i thought) we were going in here. very (xx) okay. i can stand over you like this, but you'd have to crouch a lot. alright Literature Science and Art Building. oh i can't give credit for that i'm sorry... anybody know why it's orange?     what is with this guy? what? what is with this guy? the Ann Arbor lady didn't even get that one. get what? huh? why is this orange?  that's_ that's the one we're gonna (call our home) no actually you'll n- probably go in there like once, a year, if_ less than that probably. the only thing that's really in there of of any worth, of anything at all in my opinion, is the Cashier's Office. and i'd really just as soon not go there anyway because i've always gotta pay my phone bills there because they always send me these notices that say, yeah you owe us thirty-six dollars and if you don't pay it yet you'll shut_ we'll shut off your service. that's happened about six times or so, but they give you about ten notices ahead of time so it's kinda cool they_ you know they lead up to it... the Registrar used to be there so_ but they moved so pretty much the only thing worth anything is the Cashier's Office. (xx) (hand me a) Starburst (candy) ah Jesus, mystery chew. that was_ it's pink. (Nasr) (uh'uh) mystery chew. (how come you) (xx) the Starburst? it's for the brick. i (didn't) he got it for the brick and he got the mystery chew cuz he's been bitching at me about the fact that he only gets the pink ones. i like the pink ones. well you can have all his pink ones then. officially. okay. we're actually gonna stop right here... alright, is there anyone in this group living in Helen Newberry or Betsy Barbour in the fall? a friend (is.) huh?  your friend is.  that's (xx) Dentistry School here (xx) it is one of the best. really? yeah the Dental School is really really good. i've had some friends that've gone here and actually my dentist went here, and they said, the um_ they're trying to phase out a lot of the old professors but, the uh professors are (xx) yeah and they're uh_ they're really, rough. do you have to watch the green sign? oh if it was green i would have to watch out if it was green okay so this is the next stop on our tour now i'm gonna try to make this as inconspicuous as possible cuz hey we're off campus now. so i'm not gonna try to embarrass you guys in front of a bunch of people you don't know and everybody's like oh great it's a tour. i love these tours. blocking up the streets, blah blah blah shut up i gotta go. that's all there is. Domino's. Domino's Pizza Domino's Pizza's the coolest place, at four o'clock in the morning because it's cheap, and it's open at four o'clock in the morning it's one of the only places that's gonna be open at four o'clock in the morning for your, dining needs. why would you need to dine at four o'clock in the morning cuz you were at a party until two-thirty you're completely wasted and you come back here and you eat some food. now, i still eat here at four o'clock in the morning i'm not much of a drinking guy but i come here four o'clock in the morning anyway just kinda to see what's up with_ what's up at four o'clock in the morning the line is stretched out the door, everybody's hanging out here, all kinds of people really fun place to hang out. um another neat thing the reason why i actually_ that i came here to the University of Michigan, is because, we just walked across the street, from, that way and if we would've come from that way, or even come from that way, we went from campus to off campus in a matter of, oh i don't know thirty feet. that is pretty damn cool you can't get that, anywhere else. you cannot get that anywhere else you go to Michigan State, there's campus, and way the hell over here is off campus you go to any other school it doesn't work this way it sort of just melds and kind of flows and, it's just pretty damn cool. so, yeah... and it's neat cuz you can go, out to a club or to a... social event other than a club and, get home in like five minutes cuz your dorm's right across the street from that, place like Dominick's or something. any questions before we move on? no. no. damn you guys. whoops excuse me. sorry   no (whatever) (xx) good job. aw thanks. oh i was for a uh... (xx) concert. what concert? i don't remember her name but she's uh like Tori Amos or something, or piano piano. okay. don't remember her name. Tori Amos by any chance? no. Tori Amos played here. anybody else? who else has been here who else? graduated here. graduated here. anybody else. come on. Harlem  who? Cleveland Orchestra Cleveland Orchestra.

Saint Petersburg Philharmonic San Francisco Symphony University of Michigan Musical Society Single Ticket Day, all kinds of great stuff happens here. this is one of the coolest auditoriums ever in the history of the world i'm not kidding you at all, um if you ever come here...  the reason why we go through the fountain is because all incoming freshmen, walk from this part, which is the Grad Library, or the Grad School towards campus, it's kinda your culminating_ it's your it's your_ it's your oncoming to the U-of-M and (i'm) getting involved and do we start from up there? what? do you walk (xx) just leave your stuff up here. do we have to run through it? no no we'll just walk we'll just walk. it's gonna be like hey i'm coming to the U-of-M and damnit i'm proud to be here. everybody does it. i have a question. come on. come on. (Anna) ugh. watch out, there's (xx) (xx) oh yeah. Tina's lame she won't do anything. it's not that cold, it's not that cold. it is cold. (oh shit.) alright. hey hold up. move move. (xx) oh no.

(it's your tip.) sweet. whoa. so anyway hand me my sock it's clean i swear to God. throw me my sock. would you throw me my sock somebody please thank you very much jeez, i don't want to touch your sock. you walked through the fountain didn't you, you know who's been in that fountain? they did it i don't know why they did it they got really wet doing it and, why would you put your lips on a stone thing, that's been there oh i don't know, forty years? it's not like they scrub it down every night. now would be, a good time, to steal her bucket. oh go get her (sure.) should i do it? yeah. get her. you know how pissed she would be? so? (xx) oh she's already (xx) somebody wanna go get her bucket for me? yeah. alright. go get her bucket quick just go dude she's not gonna do anything. oh shit. he is not sly about it (xx) really comes in (xx) i'll give him credit though (i'll) (somebody get the) the i've been there no.  so anyway it looks just like a penis i swear to God, it's got two little towers at the base of the penis okay. so everybody, trust me go up there and look at the brick dick that we call it. i was gonna make a comment that maybe she's never seen a penis,  don't shoot my students. i'm not shooting your students... oh shit alright actually i gotta fill this before we go. la- everybody's got my back right? (so) you said uh that Business undergraduate's number one? yeah. what about uh (uh,) U Penn.   what's that? Wharton's number one for graduate? i'm not sure    yeah y- what about uh graduate? i- the graduate program is really good too. wow. wow. (xx) Josh how how hard is it to get into the law school? how hard is it to get into law school? it's pretty hard, but, actually i have a lot of friends that are in the law school. uhuh. that's really? so i mean if you if you do really well your undergrad, and you_ get involved  well yeah because_ i mean honestly, like you have to be good you have to be damn   yeah.  yeah. so everybody's like oh i'm gonna study my ass off when i get here well that's good. but if you don't get out man, you're not going anywhere i'm sorry nobody's gonna hire you, nobody's gonna give you a job you're not gonna get in at any grad schools, i mean you got a_ you have a four-point-oh and you know, whatever totally blow your LS- LSATs away, but if you do anything nobody wants you. cuz you're a nerd. yeah. (what's like the) average class in the Business School? what's that? what's the average class size in the Business School?   wow. it's small.  hold on one second. i'm not sure what the_ what the mean G-P-A is i think, like as long as you're right around like a_ like a three-three three-four three-five, you're okay. that's, (an extra) (xx) (is it like) the hardest one to, get into kind of, the Business School? it's one of 'em, i mean_ yeah it's pretty_ it's pretty competitive. um but yeah... woohoo woo yip yip. nice dreads... and what about med school (that's) just like med school's pretty tough to get in here too, um, but it's not impossible. yeah. oh i know. i mean, i know a lot of people that are going to med school here too. that i never really? yeah. so it's kinda like anybody can make (xx) you just gotta bust your ass. yeah.  yeah (sealed) yeah we're gonna talk about the M in a minute but Tina's gonna go in the library if you wanna go in the library we'll go to the library but, i don't see any point. if you guys wanna go we'll go. who wants to go in the library raise your hand. anybody? no okay. (well) yeah. you want to? (i mean i-) i can go by myself i (don't i don't care) you guys care if we go in the library? yes. it's just a bunch of books haven't you been in a library before? ooh ouch.  damn Anna that kinda hurt. that did kinda hurt i i i think an ass-whipping is, definitely in order. yeah really. no. that's (cool.) you got two personal tours to do tomorrow for him and for (him.) that's right that's right i got personal tours to do tomorrow. anyway uh we're kinda standing in the central Diag area_ i don't know if she's done. hey hey are you done? Tina. what? are you gonna be done after this? no. oh. i rerouted. oh. i'll be_ i'll be off here in a second. well hurry up. okay. God, jeez. okay anyway. so she's taking the lame route so you guys actually really did_ definitely got the best tour because you're supposed to end with the M it's the coolest part. so she's gonna go from the M, to the library. so alright anyway. so okay there's a lot of different things to talk about in this area. introduce you to a few buildings on campus so i don't_ i give you the full tour. over here is the, Randall Laboratory Physics Building this red one right here if you can_ you can barely sorta see it over here, is the middle white part in the middle now why is this building cool? well physics is held there and physics is cool. no actually physics sucks i hate physics it's probably one of the worst subjects that's ever been taught here ever, um that's just my personal opinion, but um anyway the cool b- part about this building is that middle part is all completely free-standing and it's on its own base. it's on its own base. why is it on its own base it's so it's they can do seismic studies. they have these little generators in the inside that can shake that part of the building so they can do, earthquake stuff. pretty damn cool okay. the rest of the building, isn't like that but the middle part it's all labs up in there and it shakes freely on its own base. whoa. moving on to the left coming over here to the brick building over there is the School of Natural Resources and the Environment anybody involved in that? really cool program here at the University of Michigan lotta people call 'em tree-huggers, i do too, but i got a lot of friends who are in 'em_ in it so i can do that. really really really neat if you're, going into biology another neat thing to do is to go to the Biological Station up, towards the U-P. really really cool thing to do i did it i studied insects, and uh ecology. the insects was a little off but it was pretty cool too cuz i got the really phat Belostomatid it's really really neat it's kinda greenhouse? greenhouse. greenhouse thank you very much yes i am a biology major. uh the building behind there is the Biology Building, not much in there except the Nat Sci Auditorium, cool stuff happens in Nat Sci Auditorium they show free movies in there every now and then, you gotta wait for about two hours in line just to see the free movie but it's pretty cool nonetheless, and uh you'll take exams in there it's one of the worst places to take exams because you're sitting in this little chair, and you got this little tiny desk like you did for those placement tests right, the desks are smaller and th- the uh_ the table_ er the_ the guy in front of you is even closer. so you try to put your, knee up you're kicking somebody in the back of the head it's a really big pain in the neck, took all my exams in there that's why i didn't do so well here at the University of Michigan. moving over here is Angell Hall, Angell Hall pretty much speaks for itself a lot of great stuff in a lot of administration buildings etcetera etcetera etcetera. any questions before we move on to the coolest part of the tour? is that where the Fishbowl is? that's where the Fishbowl is. what is the Fishbowl? everybody's wondering what the Fishbowl is Fishbowl is one_ you'll see it on the third day. unless you're an engineer. uh then you won't see it, um you'll see a cooler building actually but um the Fishbowl is a big big big room, and it has, about three hundred computers in it. one of the largest um... (here's) a mystery chew. oh my god. i dropped a mystery chew. has about three hundred computers in it and's one of the biggest computing sites on campus, uh University of Michigan houses more computers than any other facility in the United States except Microsoft and NASA. whoa. lots of computers so the question is do i bring my own computer? obviously you don't have to cuz you can find a computer somewhere else because we got that many computers i guarantee there's probably gonna be one available. if you're willing to walk a little bit. who wants a mystery chew? takers for the mystery chew? Adam's got the mystery chew, threw it on the ground, last part of the tour you gotta run, like naked (a in front of them) no no no shh. that's coming up. you mean like the bell ringing (and you have to run back and) (xx) yeah that's true but there's something else. okay so what everybody always thinks, they always tell people on the campus day tours and the other campus day tours, you know when you got your parents with you they always say, every time, um, Michigan beats Ohio State the pumas roar. well, we beat Ohio State all the time. and they're stone. they're not roaring i'm sorry it's not gonna happen. so actually what is true is every time a virgin graduates from University of Michigan, the pumas roar. and as they're, stone, they've, never roared. anyway so that's the legend just wanted to throw that out, for the little thing there, moving on to the last part of the tour this is the M. very sacred and, actually geographical center of campus, this is the M. the M was actually just refinished all this area right here (all) around, it was_ used to be blue this blue part right here uh we- used to be blue but it's not blue now it's rose or salmon or whatever the hell color you wanna call it, and they just sent it to England last year to have it refinished last summer this whole area was completely redone so you're standing actually in the new Diag, um and it's a lot more light_ lit than it was before like i said i was playing frisbee here (at) two o'clock in the morning, we're gonna come back from the comedy troupe thing at night and you_ we probably are not going to go through here but you look over here you see this wow i mean it looks like, what do you call it Close Encounters of the Third Kind man it's just like all lit up it's totally cool people study out here under these lights, two o'clock in the morning i'm not kidding at all, so anyway, really neat refinished and everything like that so what's what's the story about the M? you can't step on it. shh. see i don't want you to screw up the story, see i appreciate your efforts but you can't screw up the story cuz everybody's got their own version of the story and everybody always tells their version of the story, and it's wrong i guarantee it this is the only story, here. cuz it's your story. cuz it's my story and i only tell the truth, i never lie. so anyway, currently stepping on the M why am i allowed to step on the M? i just graduated from the University of Michigan and i've already taken a bluebook. what's a bluebook? a bluebook is a big thick wad of paper. with a blue cover on it. and wh- if you take a class like econ, take a class like oh i don't know philosophy, sociology, history, those kind of things. involves a lot of reading and writing. you're gonna probably take an essay exam. that essay exam is gonna be given in a bluebook, if you are to disrespect the M... eat the bluebook fascinated. fascinated in awe. yeah. that deserves a Starburst right there. (okay good.) definitely definitely. how do you pronounce your name? (Shill. Sepa) really. yes. that's beautiful. thanks. no i'm not kidding at all, that is awesome. okay so anyway, actually that concludes our tour. yes. (can i have a) frisbee? yeah definitely definitely. so we're done, actually, if you guys, okay. (where is) (xx) 	1
OFC320SU153.json	the only batik i have is this one here, mhm after class i have another class. okay okay, alright  is that what_ yeah. um, oh Janet was going to be here at ten forty-five. okay. i know as soon as i sit down with this i'm gonna be like oh, i didn't look at that. so remember then when you're, when you're looking at the weft ikat, they've tied and dyed the threads that they're weaving in, this way this is a more, difficult technique because you have the warp threads are all the same color, and they would've had to have, strung up these, weft threads on a different frame, to tie and dye them to get these different, think about the different color, the different color variations with the colors have to go in at different times. have you done any textile design  but then it wouldn'ta been the first one. um    mhm  mhm, mhm that seems to sort of go over where, there was a yellow re- you know a re- when they do the dyeing though mhm? it's dipping. dipping okay.  mm i mhm    yeah  yeah okay  okay, okay is wrapped   mhm  yeah s- so they can have these little, little spools of thread above and not hanging below which is  yeah, cuz there's little knots on the corner of each one. t- here's a little patch. well again it's just a beginning, a   mkay. and y- i mean you also don't know like, when it was done? it's very hard to d- date textiles mhm okay  okay okay. um  mkay mkay. do you know_ i might find this out from researching too but if it was common to do both the ikat and the in Palambang it is now. okay which is Palambang, P A L L A M B A N G. it's a city in East Sumatra. remember that's the other place in Sumatra that does the songket. okay mhm mkay so the books that deal with generally, Indonesian textiles, Sumatran textiles Balinese textiles are all over surveys of Southeast Asia, and just float through and look for the Indonesian sections. okay okay. and mos- i mean do you think we'd be able to, get enough out of the stuff that's on reserve? or would we be going like way beyond that? um i- it might help if you go beyond that, but i would start in the reserves. okay okay. mkay? and you could i m- remember if you do a MIRLYN search,   okay  hm? i think you can specify the library, too? oh maybe not. oh in the search? in MIRLYN. yeah but don't specify the  okay okay? okay so, but you'll probably stick between Hatcher and here. okay okay? great just have fun with it. okay alrighty? okay. thank you. yep. see you tomorrow. yep. only one more week. ahh i know... so fast. RESTRICTED good how 'bout you? RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED okay well obviously we're looking at the back side RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED well, we have different techniques RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED so we have RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED mhm and then RESTRICTED RESTRICTED well now we know that songket right? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED right. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah, uh w- when you start thinking about color RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED well, yeah it's one of those colors now that um, with age it could have oxidized a bit, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED okay good. RESTRICTED they are the same RESTRICTED and the green areas RESTRICTED remember when i- they're lying_ and and this i- doesn't have to be a big focus RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED but the other thing to go on is less technical RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED well look at the wear and tear, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED into the sides. so it could've been too, if you think about it, the way it was folded, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED if we just go carefully and lay it out here on the floor, you should be able to RESTRICTED hi. RESTRICTED yeah it's automatic failure. RESTRICTED and it's nice to have photographic records of these because you can, study the motifs at leisure too and be able to compare. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED oh excellent. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED oh no no no. you're RESTRICTED Emily if you wanna hop, over,  oh no oh honestly it's fine i really like i'll admit i have no real, knowledge of how to do this so i m- okay okay will   okay okay okay okay mhm okay mkay? mhm. i actually oh (xx) RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED okay. um, i think initially i wanted to do that but actually i think that this one, is a little more interesting, than this  mhm okay good. okay okay. and this is from the island called Timor, yes  okay  okay mhm  RESTRICTED okay so, you want us to determine where it's from based on how it's made and then w- the motifs found on it? is  usually yeah. it's like fi- finding the point of what's called the provenance of of an artifact. and what you usually have to go on are style and motif and color and technique and size and shape, and see how close you can get with other similar objects that are, truly have been identified as, coming from a certain place from made by a certain people. and that will give you, get you closer to understanding the social context. if you can't get, that close, you can step back and then say well, but we do know, it's a woman's, mhm okay  okay okay, so first, so, i've got a microscope here. um, if you don't have measuring tape you're lucky cuz Janet does. i have a ruler,  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED mhm. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED (xx) okay it's the hazards of, not having these in a museum collection. RESTRICTED um, as best i can RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and i will be available the week in between the fourteenth and the RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED thanks. RESTRICTED are these like individual motifs or would you say they're more border patterns? th- the stripes? mhm i would say they're stripes but, this um s- this stripe within the stripe? mhm ooh is it turned the right way? y- i don't_ yes. okay... well they're, it's definitely something cuz   it looks like it's dyed. dyed as opposed to a thread going across mhm mkay. so then that would be called ikatted, right? mhm  yeah it's definitely, on the yellow one it's two. mhm  i th- mhm mhm okay and you know it's a  right okay. oh no   mhm warp? fa- right so here you have one warp band this way, so this is a supplementary, warp, here. and then you have the plain weave, mhm wow  yeah wow yeah wow is it_ and then and its the same it looks like this one is bigger. mhm. so you have a different scale. but then the others do appear to be the same.  yeah yeah. hm   yeah which is interesting. so would that be where you think they rolled it? to leave room for   no, the bottom also has a difference in it. so... so this could be, here you start out, and as the weaver wove, it got wider cuz they were pulling less hard, on the selvage here in the weft threads, and that, was, here, and then as they came down to the end it got tighter, so it became smaller again. see how the this sort of, pulls in and curves? mhm  right. so in other words she's she's weaving something, like, this, right? mhm mhm RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED bye um, will give you a different width, mhm  bu- yeah hi let's get you started, uh out there. you wanted to work with the Balinese piece. yeah can we photograph them? yes, okay oh okay also give you a chance to think about questions you might have in class tomorrow. yeah. do you want us to go so in detail in the disser- description that we talk about how, the stripes increase and decrease? i think you need to decide what you want to spend your time on. we're only doing three four pages. yeah okay but every single thr- thread, not you ca- you just can't.   i think you wanna, wanna keep it in perspective here. okay  mkay mhm  i feel like this is so_ God i don't, know where to start but i'm getting better.   can i come back if i find that i  oh okay   okay, no problem. and these are upstairs? the books? yeah you're gonna find if you do a s- a MIRLYN search you can start with the research books on on reserve here, mhm okay  okay if it's ikatted, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference in between the strings or would you? because i said i thought that this was initially but then looking at it closely it looks like there is blue, thread actually stitched. take a look on the other side and see what you see. a lot of times what you need to do is consider both sides when you're talking about a woven item. there it has green in it that i can't even see here. yeah, and where else do we see green? there, and there... here too. those are threads. mhm the blue? yep. yeah mhm they're green aren't they? i think they're blue. no you're right they look green in here  mhm. well that's the problem with indigo. it will go from blue to green not this bright of a green, mhm but a  mhm yeah yeah  yeah yeah mhm so we're looking at the inside then. see how the threads, bunches are ending here? uhuh    mhm yeah mhm okay okay so, okay. that  okay but it's not a bad lesson to learn that the more you look the more you see, and realize how complicated, this was to assemble. cuz at first glance, yeah... wow but i don't want you to um i don't do you know how to how to start do you know, how you wanna begin? not really um okay so look part one yeah formal analysis, dimensions so here we have a long mural cloth, mhm mhm so you've looked at paintings yeah okay, so think about it in t- in those terms. then, what do the artists do? we have one particular technique here in the center field mhm. i would say an ikat. and then you wanna decide is it warp or weft ikat, and then you have a songket here, and then you have this technique of crochet here, and crochet is not local. so this obviously came in in the colonial period. mhm mhm  okay yeah okay. so just, holler, if you have more questions. okay. and this one looks different, you would say it's not weft but warp, because of, it goes this way? well the warp is going this way right? yeah  mhm okay  okay  so they can do that? i didn't_ they can just put threads in for a, block? mhm. so when when she's weaving, here y- you have, the weft and the warp and then she has extra little threads that she's weaving in and she's going one green here one green here one green here as she's weaving, she's creating these patterns, in, incorporating them as she's weaving, not laying them in on top later. okay okay, mkay. i think i have a good base to start with i suspect i'll be   sure. hopefully that helps, look over these um, um, mhm okay okay  mhm okay okay thank you. you're  yes, and let's see, you do, you do know that it's going to be posted the final,  mhm yes okay alright.  you too. oop, i missed it 	1

(you know you're right you're probably right) ooh (xx) (in the road) (another, a) Red-eyed Vireo back (there) (definitely) oh, there's a bluebird house over there w- is there anything in, like on the corner of the field. i see a Barn Swallow. next to the bird box? that a bluebird? there're like four that just (xx) by the, that (bird box) you guys remember what the bluebird the juveniles look like? they're  look like sparrows don't they? thank you ohh, what else could live in a bluebird box though? swallows i don't think it's a swallow. well there's something really tiny, out on the (xx) oh, about ten birds just flew out of that (xx) somebody here's a really good (xx) which, which ones were those? your your (xx) (xx) like way in the distance? like Sandhill Crane? oh i hear dogs yeah i don't think that (who was that) she said that there is water in the (background) she was telling them on the way over here that, there could be, a large bird that could fly by, because there is (xx) it wasn't a Clay-colored, it wasn't (xx) but it was (xx) (xx) think it sounded like Sandhill Cranes (xx) who's this guy? oop it's a bird. Chipping yeah (xx) white tail oh it's a robin i see an American Goldfinch down there. it's in that bush over there (xx) (yeah the) taller one, the closest, (xx) (xx) (want me to) hold those? do you see the um,  yeah i was looking that at that bird i couldn't_ i don't know (what that was) there were like ten of those in there and they all just like flew up and then went down. okay uh'oh do you see a dot on the chest? (xx) no i see dark wings, oh dot on the chest? (xx) sparrows i know (no) there're like ten of those (if you pull these out,) the roots smell like carrots. alright, let's look happy. is that the last one? think there's one more (xx) alright guys i think this is our  it seems much, i think we missed one. yeah i think we missed at the corner when we curved off, cuz we walked a ways. yeah. well lemme reset this. Red-eyed Red-eyed Vireo? uh'oh what is that? (Mourning Dove) what were those? oh my god. a ruby throated, hummingbird? oh yeah a hummingbird sweet is that a, Barn Swallow?   to the left mhm (what is that?) it's in the road. is it a robin? no. (xx)   Mourning Dove? Mourning Dove. what is making that that's why i thought it was a jay but oh could that be an  i don't  Evening Grosbeak is just the (xx) yeah (xx) what's that? oh. what was that? i don't know there's another, oh oops another i don't know. we have a_ oop that was the, American Goldfinch (Nancy) yeah. you got the vireo? Blue Jay? no so what's in this tree behind us here? oh yeah oh i think there's couple of 'em    oh (there was) another American Goldfinch. which one has the red head what sparrow? um Chipping i saw three of 'em. okay is this another Red-eyed Vireo (closer) or is it (xx) same one i think it's the same one. just heard a woodpecker there's a goldfinch ooh what was that? was that a kingbird? no that was a uh, uh  (xx) it is, a bla- blackbird... um    what Cliff Swallow? it's a Cliff. i think i might see a Gray Catbird... um ah  oh   there's a goldfinch right o- that's a catbird? yep, i think so.   um look in the tree and see some (xx) to the right or to the left? to the right oh yeah, oh cool. nice shot.  very nice. where is it?   it's right in the middle  rusty? it's right  the big gray bird with that, that, in the middle there and it's right behind a yellow leaf and then look right to the left (of it.) go to the eight o'clock position of those leaves oh wow that's a big bird. to th- on the right side of the (road?) on the left side of the (road.) oh. i'm sorry i wa- i was talking about the right side (xx)  oh oh wow they're kind of dull but if you wanna look you can oh thanks sure   awesome excuse me you were right for the bunting can you see the, dead leaves,    um God damn it. yup yup okay then go, to like the eight o'clock position okay gotcha.  oh there it is, it's_ oh it just (hobbled) back in are we done? didn't see it okay thanks sure American Goldfinch is that one of the biggest that have been out here? oh wow huh? is that one of the biggest that have been out here? hey American Goldfinch right o- over the road. oh nice yeah that's a good one do you wanna look at it (closer?) do you see it? on the right side in this right track oh, okay. oh cool. down just above the ground, in a little purple plant. do you see it? it's eating that it's  do you see it? and it's on_ it's just, a few inches up off the ground. look yeah look down on the right keep your it's really close it's not far down the road at all it's right there it's really close bright yellow. you guys what is it doing? you got it, do you see it? preening? (or something) did he see it? did you see it? yeah. thanks. um right, here, and you can, squeeze them, together or pull them out. cool (xx) (oh this is gorgeous) i gotta come back here and pick wildflowers. alright (hold) (xx) wow no they get bigger than the catbird but the catbird's just interesting cuz it's real secretive, so, and it meows (xx) oh yeah it really does meow meow it's weird. what do you mean by secretive? um, like it doesn't to like show itself on a branch, so they're hard to find (xx) yeah and likes shrubs and (underbrush) mhm yeah whoa (is that a robin?) yeah mhm yep isn't there one more? i think we skipped one at the turn. oh great, he's gonna walk us through the (xx) yeah oh no (birds on a wire they must be) (xx) stripes on the breast there's a Barn  (is it) Chipping? (this one?) it could be. it didn't_ well, (xx) stripes on the breast, it didn't have a (xx) an American Robin in the lawn it's not th- it doesn't look like there's any (stripes) on the breast. no it doesn't yeah that one didn't have stripes. (what does the) i don't know  'm'm there's a robin right there. yeah what is that? a Blue Jay?   catbird. (it's a) catbird. oh i can hear the Cedar Waxwings. oh yeah whoa there's many things up there.   so what was  i don't know i would say catbird. right there oh are they, blackbirds? like is that their warning? mhm, yeah i think they have just a really, harsh, warning call. (xx) like the Barn Swallow oh the Barn Swallow (xx) yeah... anybody wanna look at them? lemme see oops sorry you think they're sparrows or swallows? i thought maybe they were Barn Swallows. (xx) did you see their tails? (xx) the forked tail, or the tai- the pointed tail. (xx) is the tail (xx) doesn't seem very long though. are you looking at those birds on the wire? yeah they're they're infinitely far away. but the wings look a little long. (xx) my god there are like so four more  looks like a Cliff Swallow. there's like twelve. wait is it white_ is it really white   yeah  do Tree Swallows hang out in groups, like the Barn and the Cliff? there's like, a dozen of 'em i've never s- i've never seen a Tree Swallow in a group like this. yeah me neither i've never seen one really out of a group (xx) but i i've seen like one or two on a wire, but, never together there's twelve (xx) there's thirteen. are they colonial or no?       Mourning  what's what?     Mourning Dove is that t- two_ it was one_ or was that (one) just keep (saying that) damn Mourning Doves they wake me up (in the morning) five minutes is that it? uh nope,  Mourning Dove  it sounds like an owl (that's odd) (sorry if i was) (xx) sing it for the tape.  Dr Voss they just piss him off, those damn Mourning   American Yellowfinch yellow goldfinch? goldfinch?   is that what that is? wait what is that? wait no but i saw it fly so i know i saw one. it doesn't sound like that though. but it flew she saw it,  Francie   but what is that? i don't know what for the, for the goldfinch? that well no i don't think_ i think it was a different bird. okay, how'd you do? sounded good. what was the last one that was calling     yeah, it_ i s- i could  okay good call okay (Julie,) alright.    yes those  birds on the wire birds on the wire. probably sparrows?      oh yeah the first ones were larger (than) yeah they were large, dark any idea? we got we discussed   	1
MTG270SG049.json	they might be so (xx) so anyway, um, finished? the real, item of business for today is uh, for Rob to give his uh, practice for his thesis proposal. this isn't a, um, a straight group meeting either this is uh, uh to be a practice event for uh, for Rob's defense. but what we're_ the protocol of course is that we interrupt Rob on any point on either, content or, uh, presentation-style suggestions, or anything because, um, this this committee definitely will interrupt him, those of you who have been through this know. who's on his committee? um, oh it isn't up there. um, so Matt of course and Jim Dimmitt, um Steve Baker and Dave Sutep, who's a professor in physics. so so you have two outside professors? mhm right. uh although calling Steve, an outsider is yeah mhm so f- for those of you who don't know Dave is the director of the program in complex systems, so, that that's how you know it makes sense to have a physics professor, on this, committee. okay, so, um thank you for coming, and i i look forward to your comments however sca- however scathing they may be. um, my talk my, proposal is called a market protocol for decentralized task allocation and scheduling. i would like to start with a concrete example to really motivate the problem, i am addressing here. so, this is a, a stylized um air combat domain. and what we have here is some commander who wants us to perform an air attack. and there are various resources, an- and agents that can help the um commander accomplish this task. um, in this case the commander, simply wants to use a bomber squad and a fighter squad for th- for the air attack, and, um the bomber squad and the fighter squad in turn need, um each need t- to take off from an airfield. um, for this particular problem, there are b- excess resources there are plenty of airfields to satisfy the demand, so we can actually accomplish all the tasks and satisfy this commander without really much difficulty. now the tricky thing comes in if we actually bring in another commander. um this, the second commander, wants you um, perform a ground attack, which involves a bomber squad, a paratrooper squad and a fighter squad and it can be any of these, um squads but it i- he does need all three of those squads. now the problem is these squads in turn need airfields, i- each one needs an airfield, and, but we can't satisfy both of these commanders at the same time, because they need a total of five um squads, but there are only four four units of the airfield available. so, i- if we need to somehow decide what the more valuable task is what the best cost-benefit trade-off is and, alloc- and in this case reallocate the goods, to, um meet the highest value task. uh in this case if we assume the commander, the commander two has a  what's the concept of value? value i'll i'll get to that le- let's let's just kind of leave that a little bit vague right now we'll we'll just say there there's some, value to, the um, commanders for accomplishing, you know, um tasks, and there may be some costs in providing some of the resources, and i'll i'll formally define what what those, costs and values look like later. you know i i think, uh of course the reallocation is interesting but i, wouldn't necessarily, um, trivialize the initial, allocation, in the first place, you might wanna just say, you know how we come up with this original solution, th- in this case, it's easy to find one, but, that's part of, the work is how to, find solutions in these, networks you know the style of your presentation i- it says okay you know where th- i'm really, where i'm really starting is this reallocation problem that's not okay w- s- so, so yes, so the the fir- that first resource allocation was part of the, whole allocation problem that wasn't a particularly difficult one, um, it it becomes a really, more challenging problem when you have the limited resources right. right so here's for example how (to make it) more difficult. but also in just mentioning the problem, um, you might want to suggest to them that, that the the details of this are really ar- it's just completely contrived, for, a DARPA site visitor okay... so, what we a- what i do then, so i wanna formalize this model, um um, a bit and i do that in a in a task dependence network what i call a task dependence network. that's a very, there's a general model for how, we can do these um, these task allocation problems when we have these sort of hierarchical dependencies and we have to form a supply chain. um, so let me explain the portions of the task dependence network. now these circles throughout the network represent the tasks or the resources. um, in in either case i i actually treat them i- in exactly the same fashion i assume that a task, is performed by one agent on behalf of another, and that the results can't be, replicated for, can't be directly replicated for other agents y- if you want to have if you wanna have this task performed for say, (you know) an- any this task performed for two agents you would hafta have two agents performing it. so in that sense, the tasks are really the same as any resource any discrete resource these are, all discrete so, i um, basically call them goods. so all these circles represent goods which can be either, you know, a task or a resource. um, on this end, i have  you- that that isn't e- even necessarily quite, the correct characterization you_ the- some of these prod- s- well      i- it's it may be more natural in some problems or another to call it task or resource, when you're actually characterizing  you know uh, a supply chain you know producing automobiles or a job shop the intermediate um, goods may be, physical resources, that  you said this was the first example? yes. this_ s- so   oh. but you have, the ground attack, there. well, we could say that this, this agent exists here but is is not accomplishing anything. it might be more clear to people, if you don't have that ground attack (thing there) if you claim this as the first example but actually in a way it might be clearer if you do, because,  right that's right    so you might wanna, so, if you wanna make that point then, and keep it this way then you have to point out, see the, just the graph, makes it look a lot more like the second example than the first example. so you have to point out that, the thing on the bottom isn't, commander it's just the, capability. okay, mkay... um, so, (sorta) explain what the allocation is now a solution allocation is one where, one or more of the consumers actually acquire their goods and there's basically a complete supply chain all the way back to the suppliers. what that means is, well there's two things to, have a complete supply chain one is that for any good, the number of input arcs equals the number of arc- output arcs, or in other words supply equals demand. um, another requirement is any producer, that is selling its output good must also acquire all of its input goods, so, that is we r- require that the producers be feasible. and again here's another example of a,  yeah i'll d- i'll do that right now. um, well maybe i'll d- i'll do it in a minute. so also i do have, i wanna point out there's this, producer here that is, colored light green, um, what i've i've done that to distinguish it from the other producers, um, this producer did acquire its input, but didn't sell its output. now that is allowed in a solution, it's not, uh es- the most, i- it's a little bit kind of wasteful to use some resources that um really don't, you know that are, that the producer doesn't want because it's not producing an output. but, we we need to consider this possibility, in in these, um solutions. and again i, showed, here here's the example again with the second commander coming in and shows how the um, how the, how the links change to feed the supply chain into the second commander. um, i wanna talk a little, go, back a little bit to the costs and values i that i hinted at. um i assume that, each consumer, is interested in potentially a, you know some set of goods, but, the consumer only wants to acquire one unit of one of the goods. um, so basically, (you know) it can acquire, some value for any, particular good but its total value is just the maximum of all those values of the goods that it obtains. the suppliers, um have some opportunity costs for supplying the goods, this can either be some real costs for, you know t- real monetary costs for um, supplying the good or maybe some lost value from some other use it could have put the, um, good to. so in this case i just say each supplier, its its total um, opportunity cost is the sum of of the individual opportunity costs for each good. um, so um... uh you said you have a a, the quantifier of G and X in the second bullet you probably should have it in the first bullet too. so the max over G, should be G and X here? yeah. oh yes, you're right. you're right. yep.  w- yes with the producers. and with the producers or with multiple consumers. if we wanted to actually model, um additive, um value with the consumers we can simply simply replicate the consumers and have each different consumer, um, want some different inputs and then, and look at, the, you know the the total, the sum value of them. um another op- possibility is maybe a consumer wants to acquire multiple goods, um rather than just a single good, well we can do that if we look at here, one way to look at you know this uh commander two is we can see that what it what the commander really wants is these three, separate goods and this producer, is basically, defining this good to be, the combination of these goods. so we can um, so we can actually have a, a large range model a large range of problems and value functions, with this simple um um, setup. um, now i wanna talk about the value of the overall solution. (excuse me) uh uh, is the, second bullet is there a typo to have a C-O, on the left hand side and a O-C on the right hand side? yep. let me just stop you for a minute Rob mhm  i think that's a good point and even i- even whether there's a slide or not, it i mean part of, what we're (referring) to is that you started so quickly, jumping into something that it wasn't,    yeah, you don't want to bog down you don't want to bog it down     okay. s- so getting back to your question about this slide? i'm pretty familiar with this but i'm, h- having trouble, understanding the math. i mean th- there's hardly any math there but, i think if maybe the symbols, or... or maybe just if you had a picture, for each of those two, yeah i- i  i i went kind of back and forth on that myself, um, yeah i could i mean i could_ this is a pretty simple concept i could just say, you know say this is the sum, this this is a little, nicer way to represent this... i i don't but in- may- maybe someone can give me, some suggestions i... how- is is is it  um, n-... no that's, well i mean i can use some different letter to indicate it. yeah  no not necessarily. so it's so he has changed the model since the last time i saw it i think it it do- i mean it turns out it doesn't really matter whether they supply one thing or a multiple things because right sh- can you say again why, it's the max? the max? i'm just good okay. or,  (okay) but... consumers only ever (draw on) where it has inputs that, where it requires all of them. no they o- actually in these all the examples is they only have, have inputs of one. but if they had multiple inputs it would be that, that the meaning would be they ha- they need all of them, no     but this is a producer. the commander only wants this, (in) wants this good. well  that comman- has  so maybe you need a different shape,   no i do have an example  oh,  yeah  so they sh- you should have a different shape i think yeah um yeah, you're right, um i used to- i, i- it's really the limitations of the drawing program that caused me to d- well ugh i mean i_ well you see_ wha- in my in my_ no, in my papers i i i i ha- was able to draw nice oval,  yeah     no, ok- well no one thing one thing that might clarify things maybe i should wait on these values and costs af- until after i do scheduling because here, this is where it becomes really clear why a, a commander m- a a consumer would want multiple, to consider multiple inputs. um, yeah, and it doesn't seem like that stuff at all refers to values and costs, the scheduling, those next two slides of scheduling right? not no, not explicitly okay so since they don't... uh uh okay,  well um, well, they're not special cases of producers because, see a producer, i mean i- i'll get into this later but a produ- consumers and suppliers can get away with really, really s- like, really simple, bidding policies and, it's a little more, complex for the producers because they have hafta they hafta get apart all their inputs in order to sell their output. wait why couldn't you define them to have, potential to have or relationships over inputs too? the, producers? yeah.    yeah that's not a problem but i just think, producers and consumers have should have a difference icon representation (you know) they should because, uh because i k- sort of forgot which was the consumer and which was the supplier. le- let me s- let me see if i can rep- let me see what i can do about that later. alright. in terms of wha- so  they don't have different meanings. well, yeah multiple inputs to a consumer to a prod- yeah consumer, have an or relationship but multiple inputs to a producer have an and relationship. no but that's not what the_ the arrows just mean, can, you know can make use of or um, you know an arrow from a good to a agent means can make use of. and whether it's, you know what the combination rule is, inherent in the type of uh so, let me go on t- uh i wanna, spend a l- i mentioned that this is task allocation and scheduling, and i wanna sh- um su- suggest how we can actually use this model to d- perform scheduling, now there are m- this is not necessarily the only way we would do scheduling but it it's certainly i think that it's a fairly general approach, um i'm assuming that uh, we're h- we have discrete time scheduling where, we have some hori- some some range of, of discrete time slots that we would want to schedule, the um, the goods over. um, the key point here is that we multiply the goods, times the number of time slots so we_ the airfield output, it can be available at time one two three or four. and, now there are certain times where, we may want to make use of, multiple units of an airfield maybe two consecutive time units of an airfield in which case, we have arbitrageurs, um, which will um, an arbitrageur will, take some number of consecutive inpu- uh consecutive um, time units for some good and produce a temp- what i call a temporal bundle good. so this good represents, two time units of of airf- of an airfield, um ending at time two. and this one represents two time units ending at time three and so on. uh in this model i assume that the fighters wanna, acquire, wanna acquire the- one of these these bundles they don't care which airfield they use but they wanna acquire both of the units from the same airfield which is why i've split them off in this particular model. um,  it depends on how y- what how  in this problem i'm assuming we want consecutive, um, y- you cou- there are a lot of ways you could model, scheduling depending on what your constraints are. i- i'm just showing, ch- giving a feel for how one might do this.  well i'm i'm just as- i'm just saying well l- say for this problem they can i- i- pr- prev- previously they could get it from actually from either one-A or two-B, that was the case before,  one-A or one-B. there's also two-A and two-B down here somewhere, oh, right okay. um, what's that, little box? before the word arbitrageurs? that was a conversion problem, from PowerPoint, whatever i had before to PowerPoint what you have here. what was what was there? there was nothing... there. like a sp-  okay. i see what you're saying, um, it might be clearer i- if th- that label two-two, maybe, if you, since you have room what if you just spelled out airfield, parentheses, two-two. yeah i think you're right i c- there is room for that what does, A-T-T mean under the fighter attack one?     at T, yeah, oh, i put what- another thing you might do is italicize T. okay. although if you're gonna do it in a  that's true it can be hard to read i'll i'll play with that to make it, better, might put the at back up, up here write an at sign or something, instead of A-T mkay. now i also wanna mention that sometimes when we w- go into scheduling we don't want to make all the goods we don't wanna make them all temporal goods like this, um, i'm assuming in in this problem, um that the fighters, we- we're just scheduling the airfield over some short period of time, but once the fighters go out they take several hours to perform their, their attack, and that's beyond the scheduling horizon. so i assume that actually the f- using the fighter squad, tha- tha- i s- say that that's actually consumed, and you can't use, the same fighter squad over multiple time periods. so i don't multiply this, time four times i can just have a single unit, of it, and to perform a fighter attack you have to acquire one unit of it, and this guarantees that you_ only one of these time slots, can, can actually be active. for the fighter attack. w- why do you have a, another good at the very end? at the_ why do i have these? yeah this represents a fighter attack. at time two, at time three and time four, which a fighter attack requires use of the  doesn't that, s- rectangle represent a fighter attack attempt? this? this is, well this is a fighter attack producer. producer... so you don't have a consumer in this example. not not okay i'll i'll get to that, it's it's too big to put on a single screen. okay okay i don't know if this would work but if you could, like take the previous network in a little box up in the corner and, and draw, put, you know some color on the part that you, exploding, that might,  yeah i might be able to do that, um, i don't know if that, would work but it would help u- help us transition to this, chunk. i certainly should explain up front that this is only a portion of the network. that's something i f- i neglected to do. um, now this is at the other end of the network a portion of the other end with with commander one, um actually yeah this's commander one and i- and it wants an air attack, and w- it's happeni- it can have the air attack at time two three or four. and we might assume that the commander has a different value for acquiring, the air attack at the different times maybe earlier is better, or maybe we could even say that, you know aft- at time four is too late and we might have a zero value there, for instance. so, um, and then this is where i, go and talk about the values again. um, not again, but  s- so i see oh we're not gonna, get back to scheduling again after this right? is this not explicitly  did you, y- you know in that talk about value do you have you don't have value of a solution yet. i talked about, yeah i did. oh you did? yep oh you did.   that's that's why it probably works better, yes yeah is it_ do you have any good reason to argue that that might be the case of, the, um military, application? well i don't think you'd wanna argue specifically in no right, it's uh remember the military's the one giving this money right.  so i i y- you have prices on, suppl- on um, producer_  maybe maybe you would wanna, back on its side put V, value     uhuh that's a good  s-   it might've helped to have given an example just look at this eyeballing the network first and then... that's a good idea is that paratrooper one supposed to be green? paratrooper one, paratrooper one, that is a bug, i'll get rid of that... no no, that isn't a bug the um, it_ what is the fron- yes, tha- that's a bug, that's not green. thank you. so, what's going on here? well, the s- so how these agents use these prices t- to guide their decision-making? well these these, consumers, want to um, acquire their in- acquire a good, at a price below their value. so you can see that this commander's, um ha- i- is a is acquiring its its input good for twenty-two dollars which is less than its value of thirty. and the suppliers on the other end, are willing to sell their good if they can um, recoup their costs, a- at least recoup their costs. now the producers in the middle don't have any intrinsic value for the goods so what they're looking for is just strictly profit, they they're willing t- they they'd be willing to be active in the solution if the um sum of their i- if their output co- um value, their output price is greater than or equal to the sum of their input prices. and this is just um, a formal statement of that um the agents are_ ideally the agents would want to maximize their surplus, where the surplus is defined as i specified, it's basically the difference between the value they get and the costs incurred. but i- uh someo- some producers are at a, negative value, that  oh. so,  it's kinda, well it's implicit in this, i- i'm i'm not talking about any_ i'm not talking about_ competitiveness is be- whe- is when you're talking about behavior, i'm not talking about behavior, the only assumption is here is that they're optimizing with respect to prices only. the current prices  right but di- but what makes it a competitive equilibrium is that everything is relative to given prices, and that's, stated, yeah  so tho- those are A B to E A B to E  yep B D  yep. and then just E to F yeah    yep yep yeah okay, um, so so thi- so for instance this agent is profitable.  i- it's stable with respect to prices meaning the agent no agent would want to um, do anything differently, at the current prices. unilaterally um, unilaterally, actu- actua- yes. no individual agent would want to, deviate from the allocation it receives, it it couldn't do any better at the current prices. the um, equilibrium is globally efficient, so, what this means i- um i- in thi- for this model, when the agents optimize locally, we're also optimizing globally, and this is due to the fact that they have this qua- what we call this quasilinear value, which means they, they value, goods in their value is l- linear in the money, the amount of money they acquire, and that means they can transfer the utility on a common scale so so you know that, only, the only, competitive e- equilibrium prices that exist are, are, the efficient prices, or support the efficient allocation, there's no, inefficient, c- equilibrium? equilibrium is, globally efficient. i- it any,  but that's not, necessarily true for, all discrete, resource   yep   okay and, and, and a- as you know, bundle-pricing schemes. um, als- but unfortunately, an equilibrium actually may not exist when you have, the discrete goods in complementarities which we, do have in this problem. i'll show you a particular example, of ho- where you may not have equilibrium. um, basically, what what i showed here are the constraints on the prices for all the goods, um, this  okay, the the only difference here is, that the consumer has a lower value. um, yes i'll maybe explain that so, this is showing, what was it before? uh, i think it was fifteen. um, now the the key to h- here is that, the total cost for the solution is um, is seven, and the consumer has a value of nine. so it_ i me- if we were to have an equilibrium, it should be this solution because that's efficient. however i'm going to show that we can't have an equilibrium if the consumer has a pr- value this low. and the reason it_ so if we have, we look at this, um, um, constraint, this is to ensure that, that this agent is profitable. on the other hand this, constraint, is to ensure that this agent, is not profitable, because if we raise this sufficiently high, um then this agent, can't make a profit on there. well what that means, that if you take these two constraints and (keep) them together we have, that price the price of F has to be greater than or equal to eleven. so even though, um we_ the, um, thi- this solution, would be e- this particular solution would be efficient for the consumer having a value range from seven_ from anywhere above seven, we actually can't have an equilibrium if its value is below eleven. well the the consumer shouldn't be green, i don't think. no i'm just showing, i'm saying, this is what the allocation would be, oh the green is the,  so that oh it's just a solution it's just some it's it's so- it's a solution allocation, that, that it happens to be the optimal one. so the  ye- yes  and the way you, explained it was, you know that price has to be high enough su- such that the supply_ um, the producer was not active correct because if  right  i get it. the constraint on uh, price of C, should that be greater than or equal to one? no less than or equal to one because, we don't want this supplier  you might_ you could put, for the consumer's value V between seven and, eleven. or i don't_ i mean f- so what you're saying is for any, value in that range, there's no equilibrium. yeah, y- that might be clearer just to say, well so actually w- i'm not sure why it's the the uh constraint, why is it greater than five, because the price of C can be as high as one,    so it's really only ten now, i mean still yep. though though i'm ac- yes. so, so s- equilibria don't always exist. now now i have, b- sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. the question is, when they do exist, how can we reach them and wha- you know what do we do when we don't have equilibria in, or can we even always each reach equilibria when they exist? um in the auction theory literature there's been a lot of work looking at price-based auction mechanisms that try and, reach equilibria or some approximation of equilibria sometimes you can't, reach it exactly, or o- and when they when they don't each reach equilibria the idea is to hopefully have, produce an allocation with a, sufficiently high um, wi- with a fairly high efficiency. um, one common approach to this, um using these priced based methods is the simultaneous um ascending M-plus-first-price auction. and this was actually used for the um, F-C-C um radio spectrum auctions a few years ago. um, really, was it M-plus-first-product? i'm s- okay i i there was_ you're right, it was a simultaneous ascending auction, this this is a variant of the type of auctions that were used for the F-C-C auctions. they had a lot of other rules in there too, right. so this is a variant, it's not exactly, the same. so when you say often used say simul- just simultaneous yeah yep right  yep. we're using a particular variant with a an M-plus-first-price auction rule. so there's an auction for each good. um, to kee- one important point is these auct- this auction is two sided. both the buyers and the sellers will bid in the auction. and, as an iterative asynchronous auction, that runs um, you know according to this bi- you know high level structure. um, first, some agents bid, and whenever an auction receives a bid, it issues a price quote. and, then, um then maybe some agents when they receive that price quote will decide to change their bid, in which case the auction will submit a new price quote and re- repeats this continuously, until, the agents stop bidding. at which point we've reached quiescence. so, that's kind of weird but what is it what is the bid this is supposed to be the program for the auction? um, this is really the protocol for, the agents and the auc- the interaction between the agents and the auction. i mean i- i could say a received bid   (on bid) (well but wait) the point is it's event driven. the auction  right right right okay. i'll agree to that. so tha- that continues until the agents stop bidding, at which point the auction's e- the auctions will clear. and the clearings determines the final prices for the goods, and, actually i should explain what the price quotes are i think i, glossed  it's different mainly because most, most ascending mechanisms ther- are only one sided. that's true. so  y- yes, a small amount beyond the current price quote. okay then, why is it that the, suppliers and the, consume- the, suppliers and the producers when they're selling things they're not, doing anything strategic they're just bidding their top valuation. you're right i_ well, okay the consumer  no you said   the prod- the the supl- the consumer doesn't,  the producer when it's selling? it's just the sum of its input, it's not trying to make any profit, it's just you're you're right i'm assuming, i'm i'm kind of ignoring strategic issues here. um we could look   s-  yeah it, are they, is it incentive to_ it's not incentive   Ronnie? um, in, an earlier result is that the M-plus-first-price auction can d- that, M and M-plus-pla- M-plus-first-price auctions are incentive compatible for buyers or for sellers one is compa-   right there there  no we we shouldn't expect any sort of incentive compatibility. yeah it only makes it worse when things are iterative w- well another thing is it's really hard to talk about ince- you can't talk about incentive compatibility for the pruc- producers anyways, you can only talk about incentive compatibility when you have, a a, a set value for a good. the producers want to make profit. and, it_ that_ they just have an extreme- a very  well if you fixed, i mean if you fixed any, all but one, the price of all but one good, you could talk about well i- what's the incentive for bidding on the other one but i- oh i oh i see, the producer but but this is not an iterative_ i mean, the price quotes are iterative but it's not an iterative auction it's a one-shot_ i mean only once (do)  (right)  the actions, the bidding actions, okay, that's what eliminates, incentive  yeah so actually maybe you're right there is a weird thing because, this isn't a direct mechanism where the producers just report their types actually if they did all they would say is, here's my inputs and here's my outputs,  correct. um, i was wondering is there some, way you could, describe the producer's, um, bid on his output as a function of the price quote? like, it can only raise it, if, if its, you can imagine that if its, ha- if its costs are greater than, the current, um, uh, bid price i mean, than any buyer's willing to pay, then it might choose to just raise it as little as possible. but i- if it's actually less than some buyer's willing to pay, it could, raise it up to that, that price, and that would be profit maximizing, a simple profit maximizing (bid.) and it probably turns out that as the network progresses, the consumers, never bid any more than they have to so that, it stays at this lower, the lower bound. so the can you repeat, i did- i didn't get the, proposal  so an explanation for why this might be a reasonable strategy could be that, you could_ a simple, bidding policy for the producer would be to, bid, as much as anybody's willing to pay. but you  well there's a price quote but no no um but um, what anybody's willing to pay, it comes from the consumers way down here. and that  but in, f- yeah. so it's_ at some intermediate point, there is a price quote that says that, someone has offered, effectively someone's offered to pay this,  yeah   right (right) you know but the th-  i think all all these price quotes are very, are tentative, y- um, i guess i'm still not... yeah but you're assuming that they're taking prices as given     but but i what i'm assuming is here you_ when you bid for your output, it you're you're assuming that, you want to at least cover the cost of your inputs. right so, but if the, if it so happened that, the bid price was much more than that, than the cost of your inputs, then, a reasonable strategy would just be to bid that. n- well, no you could say a reasonable strategy is to stop bidding on your inputs, maybe  but you would if the world ended today because it's an M-plus-first-price, auction, even by bidding your tr- your true costs... alright? so if if the so  oh i oh i see. that's right. so, but so, so that seems like a reasonable story,    it may or may not be higher than that. alright, you're winning all you kn- you know that you're winning this at some price, if you bid above that current pr- the current, bid price, that's because your costs, your current costs are, are too high. if you bid bel- if you bid below it then your costs are less than that and you're still gonna stay in the game. so look at it this way, suppose that, uh, Dave and i are sellers and you're a buyer. we know that there you you've offered to buy at ten. and it costs me, three. right  but if you were the only,  and i and i well y- okay now i guess i'm understanding is you're saying, the bid all the way up well also you have to keep in mind that, that might work, okay if you're the only s- s- seller, selling to a consumer. but if you're somewhere in the middle of the chain, you bid up too high, on on multiple ends, then well, yeah so, i'm, i think that, there's, there's some way to help explai- to help raise the intuition about why you might not wanna, raise your bid. why you wanna_ as a seller, and a producer who's selling you might want to stick to this simple policy.   well it's not really myo- i mean it's not optimally myopic it seems. is it? uh,   assuming they (have) both bid and (ask) quotes well anyway i thi- we're actually,  but some simple intuitions might but they're wrong, the simple intuitions, you know they're they don't really, go through. well but, but the first impression of the bidding strategy is just that it's so, natural. for sellers to raise their bids cuz that decreases their chances. but what we know is there's actually lots of strategies, that, s- all seem plausible, and uh and some of them, don't work. most of them don't work and the one that Rob identified works and that's really, right right so, something... some justification even if it's just that, that, you know there's there are lots of other ones but they, we don't think they work but this one does, would help. but, i'll s- i'll say up front and clear that there, are potentially lots of bidding strategies some of whi- some of which may work better or be more strategically sound in some, respect, we do know that this, does have some desirable properties and it's, it's why we've,   uh i don't,  word, you have the word surplus twice (and not just once) yep, thanks. so when we define this, we can talk about, some properties of this of this, bidding policy and, auction mechanism. um, because of the ascending auction rule, the bidding does always stop we always reach quiescence. um, if we reach a valid solution and the price of the goods for any losing consumer is higher than their, value, then we've, then we'll reach quiescence with a valid solution. on the other hand if we reach quiescence in at least some consumer_ at least one consumer's winning, we have a valid solution. um empirically i've also, um, based on uh, many thousands of experiments i i, i find that, if at least some consumer in the system values its, uh good high enough, that's relative to the other values in the  thousands of okay, thousands of y- you know,  and an equilibrium. um no, it would not_ well if you_ not an equilibrium because you still have    i think right when you mention those numbers you've got to the o- the the next ones are l- are much less arbitrary so, i think it's worth pointing making a point with respect to these  okay could you explain that   right yeah so so we have to_ yeah i tried to design this experiment so that that isn't, a s- a strong artifact but, we you know we have to keep that in mind. um, i i did find that thirty-seven percent of the trials converged to the approximate equilibrium i talked about. and of those that did not converge to an equilibrium, the remaining seventy-three perce- the the remaining ones had seventy-three percent efficiency, and when we include the decommitment we had a ninety-five percent efficiency. so what this suggests, is that this protocol, is, you know it sometimes reaches equilibrium, but it st- it produces good results on average even when it doesn't e- reach equilibrium. so do you have any sense of, uh what fraction can actually have an approximate equilibrium? um, i do not have that i i haven't tried to measure that that that would  yeah. so i i don't have that sense. somewhere between thirty-seven and a hundred percent right, well we ce- yeah. now we certainly know that well, you know, a li- you know, a little more wo- th- um i guess i don't have i don't have the actual statistics here um, of of how many were improved by the decommitment but the- there, there was a, a good chunk of them were improved by decommitment, and so we we at least anything that's improved by decommitment, could have maybe had an equilibrium but we know we definitely missed it. well, actually i i wanna, i i don't i'm not gonna go there so so i don't know how many actually have an equilibrium. so yeah that thirty-seven percent could_ you know includes both the protocol, and, you know areas in the protocol, and also just nonexistence of equilibrium, in, yeah. the sixty-three percent yeah, yes. uh those are the means do you have, uh what's the distribution like is it like almost all,  do you have any feel for how the, number of number of trials that converged to equilibrium varies as the size of the economy grows?  okay. i i it's really hard to measure the size of the economy, you know i mean, you can talk about the number of goods the number of consumers number of agents, then the interconnectedness some_ you know i showed you a very simple you know, small economy, with no equilibria, um, i- it's i i w- i thi- i i i didn't do that measure because i think it would, it would be misleading. a simple simple m- such a simple measure. but wait i i would expect you know now reading the committee, Professor Dimmitt to, to push you a bit on the, empirical trial, part of things. s- push me in terms of...? why did you do this, instead of that, you know what could you have measured, what will you be measuring okay okay okay so, i've talked about, um you know w- you know the results of this, protocol. one there's one thing i've sidestepped is, how d- how do we know when when this, when we've reached quiescence? that's a straightforward thing to do if we're simulating this on a centralized system, where we know what the state of all the agents in the auctions. it's a, much more difficult problem when we have decentralized auctions and agents running on you know separate processes in a on an asynchronous system. um, the tr- the problem is that, local quiescence at one auction, does not imply global quiescence. so agents may have stopped bidding at one auction but there may be still activity going on in, other parts in the economy and if there's still activity elsewhere, prices could propagate back to that auction and there would be later activity. so, so actually, it's not even clear what local quiescence means. mm, so i gue- so local quiescence meaning, if a if a a particular auction hasn't received bids for, you know, you know, five seconds or whatever time period well it doesn't mean that, (when they say quiescence) it means, i mean actually literally it means that no one, wants to bid, at the current price, right right right correct well you could say inactivity at one auction   what about local stability? i think inactivity,  so, you know we could have time-outs and say you know, a- the auction could ask all its bidders you know do you want, you kn- there are a lot of ways you could you know check for inactivity but the point is, that's not a good measure of global quiescence. uh the trick is we want to have all the auctions reach con- (where they basically) reach consensus, on quiescence in a, and do it in a decentralized manner, we don't want to have some, centralized agent orchestrating all this we want to have the mes- the messages following the natural flow, in the task dependency network. i was gonna to give a high level view of how we can do this, um, one thing i do is when we have multiple consumers, i kind of there is some, sort of metaconsumer that, that i, introduce that, that is used to coordinate the consumer's activity so so we do have to have some, control over, we have to have some, knowledge about what's going on with the consumers but we don't have to look at the rest of the economy. um basically there_ when, when the con- you could_ does that consumer bid or anything ma- the metaconsumer? all it does, all it serves is to pass these    how do you know if you've got all the firms? how do you know? basically y- y- an auction, will pass a message only if on- if it receives a firm from all of its, bidders. that's why you have to know who your bidders are. and the same with the quiescent, basically the messages, an auction passes on a message only if it receives it. it passes a quiescence only if it receives it from all its buyers, it'll pass on a firm only if it receives it from all its sellers. and turns out, uh given these assumptions with this protocol, um, auctions will clear if and only if, we have global quiescence. there's a certain incentive for the, agents who are, you know buying something but they're not able to sell it that may not want to send off a firm, message, you know so, the- so there's another issue, do agents wa- want to actually participate in this protocol. right    okay  what? for any of the auction literature? yeah, for any of it. mkay mkay. well,  right. yeah there's a lot of literature um, and um there are some approach- s- such as (general) (xx) auction combinatorial auctions which basically aggregate, um aggregate the decision maki- allocations for goods in one location, which can potentially, you know, give a much higher, um efficiency, sometimes optimal, but there are other trade-offs in in that, so. um, my research plan, um i want, i mentioned that i've only empirically established tha- the, um, that the s- about the solution conversions i'd like to actually prove that conjecture, um, i'm working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory to actually model and, um implement some of these, um, model and implement this system in the in a unmanned spacecraft domain. um, i'd like to evaluate the adductivity properties of the protocol i tal- i touched on, the problem of when mul- dif- new consumers come in and you know w- you know c- can we reallocate to meet the new value, um we can also look at problems where resources are lost and and i'd like to know, how how well the system responds to added value or reduced cost and and does it gracefully degrade or, and by doing it in December ninety-nine you'll be just in time to, weather the Y-two-K yeah that's right and (xx) adductivity properties in advance to that and, over the long term i'd also, really like to develop a model of an- an- model and analyze the strategic incentives for these various portions of the protocol. and um, two years from now i'd like to complete the thesis. and my contributions are i've, um by the time i'm done i will have a decentralized solution method, that combines a task allocation and scheduling, um and what's really new about this is it includes both the supply chain dependencies and strictly limited resources. also this quite- quiescence detection protocol, is is, to my knowledge is f- quite novel in the field of computational economics and it's very important for the imp- for to implement these, computational market systems and decentralize. so i mean i don't disagree with that but i think, those two bullets are just really not equal, okay okay  mhm  mhm, so so (what) you're saying is, so add more bullets under this at this level? or, i'm i'm a little bit, (xx) yeah actu- actually, at the same level as quiescence...? yeah, or maybe, group them under something else like, um, uh, analysis and, um, implementation.  right. cuz quiescence i mean by by implementation i don't mean actually writing code but i mean, how to realize the protocol right right okay okay. do you have any plans to, say anything about the computational cost of (the method?) um, so the computational costs, um, i i wasn't planning on it i can say that, the bidding policies in the auctions, require nominal computation locally, be- the real time loss here is in tr- is communication. there there could be a lot of messages sent, depending on,  that's a good question to be prepared for. and also the number, and, taking some, um, problem statement and converting it to your model, could be that the number of nodes explodes exponentially. that's a little, um, i realize that it may not in other formulations actually yeah right, what is, the looking at the centralized solution what is complexity of this, problem. well the- yeah this is, i i haven't proven this but i strongly believe it's this the problem is M-P complete to do centrally, because it very, closely resembles, a an- minimum and-or, it could be in a minimum and-or graph, certainly  yes, computing a minimum weight and-or, graph is M-P complete. this is a little bit  um yeah i haven't put the effort into, doing the, the translation um, certainly when i try and compute efficiency using, you know the A-star takes a long time right but if, yeah so i doubt that. well it shouldn't be better, but  it looks a lot like a, minimum weight and-or graph problem... um, i to re- to return to the the analogy with or the connection with the minimum weight an- and-or problem i mean that's, a computationally burdensome problem, which uh, one might want to parallelize if you have multiple processors you might wanna, exploit them and what you're presenting is a method for, parallelizing as well as decentralizing, the solution of a related problem is that interesting from a, i can imagine people  even the best way to parallelize it? well you have it all centrally and then you break it up, and parallelize it. okay yeah generally, when you parallelize an algorithm the best, not the best thing to do is like, have one processor in each node and only look at your, closest neighbor that's not the best (way) right. um, since we've gone over um, quite a lot uh, probably should end it but thanks for all for your, patience and i think we've raised a bunch of things that, will come up again in time and of course, the committee's gonna raise just all sorts of, other, (considerably) comfortable things that, you can anticipate. but, i think you've got a lot to, sh- to defend yourself, i don't uh anticipate any difficulties so i know we started late i f- can't remember when we started am i o- roughly okay on time here? y- yes. okay but i think you'll need to monitor that, dynamically. because there's gonna be a l- you know res- shock events you know  you can skip stuff that you couldn't skip with us because they'll have read the paper, so uh, that's that's a risky assumption well i mean, if you wanna if you need to make up time you might be able to  right oh since you read it no they'll say oh, wait they, they usually will. um, yeah. okay? uh do uh, do we have any, topic for next week? i don't remember if we, set one... anybody want to set one?    you want us to m- can you meet, sometime today? um... yeah. why don't we say... four-o'clock? um, okay i might be here earlier (though) okay. but you have to, take off right now? yeah so so you said you'll be around? will you have any, time? um, i got a proposal to get out this afternoon okay  i'll try to go fast okay. um, okay. so we've got that set for next week. great. i think we're done. 	1
LEL175MU014.json	i think the intent is just to see if, people use big words or little in the classroom and what kind of words they use, and to once they know that that should help them, uh train T-As, train G-S-Is help people speak English as a second language. so we'll see what comes out of it maybe i'll speak good today.  say that again. will it be on reserve? um no i'm not putting it on reserve. um, okay and, if you haven't already gotten familiar with the Science Learning Center that's seventeen twenty chemistry, uh the G-S-Is will hold some of their office hours there, and i will put, uh copies of my, lecture outlines on reserve there, i will also have them available on the web, um i'll get to that in a second, uh, so you can get it in either place. okay, um, more administrative stuff lectures, six times fifty minutes a week um i know it's three two hour blocks, i will treat them as if they were six different lectures, i will, try and give a five to ten minute break in between, um i'm not always good about timing things so that the break comes exactly halfway through the period, um sometimes it will come, you know at fifty-five past the hour, more often i will run long in the first lecture, and it'll come at five after but i will give you a break at at some point or another. uh it gives you guys a chance to come up and ask questions stretch your legs get a smoke whatever. um you all get fidgety after an hour of listening to me. um, as far as, the web goes i will put, um outlines of my stuff on the web, um i'm not a big fan of giving you complete notes either on reserve or on the web, so this is as detailed as it will get in terms of what i'm going to give you. that web address you can get to through the Department of Biology homepage, but here is the direct, long link for it, overrides?  things that, react and reproduce  yeah is she reproducing? not lately is she alive? yeah so your definition doesn't work. so she's dead she's_ you_ you're happy to redefine her as dead? uh... maybe i should've said the possibility  right consume energy  made of cells. made of cells?  would you say that has to be, a natural, occurrence? i mean wh- when you say convert it makes me think of cloning. we've you know we've talked about science as um okay, cloning would be reproducing, i- in a sense it's asexual reproduction, but, even cloning would not work if the cell could not carry out metabolism, to make the proteins that that second cell or that second organism needs, the the membranes the ribosomes the D-N-A the R-N-A so, cloning does require, um metabolism and growth in size before you can split into two cells or two organisms, which would be that asexual reproduction. so, cloning does fit under sort of, creation of new life. y- you can think of lots of things like the classic example is is a virus alive. and my opinion is no it's not, because it cannot metabolize unless it infects a cell and convinces the cell to do the metabolizing for it. but things like apple seeds which, remain dormant and essentially, are doing very little if any metabolism. are they alive? well, i guess we would say yes because they're capable of metabolism and capable of growth and reproduction under the right conditions. what about like a person in a coma? person in a coma is, still metabolizing, and, um they can't do anything with the environment um, that's, correct and now we're getting into sort of sticky philosophical and legal definitions. um, they, i i mean sad_ i mean i'm sure you heard of cases where they can still reproduce um, (the,) hospital worker goes in there and takes advantage of somebody, so, 	1

Ellen donated her gift to the Women's Studies Program, and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, in honor of her mother, Vivian R Shaw, who died of breast cancer, at age fifty, when Ellen was a junior here at Michigan. to honor her mother, Ellen specifically wanted this lecture series to bring to campus scholars, and public figures, who would address a real issue, afi- a real-life issue, affecting the lives of women and girls. it is especially appropriate then, that this year the Vivian R Shaw lecture, is part of a yearlong series, of public lectures, on women's health, historical perspectives, and policy dilemmas. this series of public lectures has been made possible by a broad coalition, of co-sponsors, bringing diverse campus units together to support discussion of women's health in historical perspectives, and in its policy implications, and, uh you may want to refer to the back of the um program, it lists the um co-sponsors of the series itself... at the inaugural Vivian R Shaw lecture last year, Ellen's daughter Emily was present to introduce her mother. tonight Emily, now a senior here at Michigan, double-majoring in musical theor- theater and in psychology, returns once again, to honor her grandmother, by introducing, her mother. please join me in welcoming the granddaughter of Vivian R Shaw, Emily Vivian Agress. thank you very much. hello. i have been given the incredible honor for the second year in a row, to introduce the woman who has made this entire event possible, my mother and mentor Ellen Agress. my mother, uh my mother never ceases to amaze me. uh she, all_ though she managed to, fulfill a full-time executive career, she also was able to be a full-time mother to both my brother and i. she is by far the smartest person i know. i'll confess i still send her my papers to proofread. um i hope you all have the opportunity to uh, endow a lecture series so that perhaps one of your children can, well it's my turn. i'm Abby Stewart Director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, and i'm delighted to welcome this wonderful family, um, back to Ann Arbor, and uh my special, job, and pleasure, is to welcome Joan Brumberg to Ann Arbor and to tell you a little bit about her before she, tells us about, The Body Project. um... the range and breadth of Professor Brumberg's knowledge and expertise will i think be made clear to you by many things, but one indicator is the fact that she is currently the Steven Weiss Presidential Fellow and Professor of, History, Human Development, and Women's Studies, at Cornell University, and that's a very unusual package, to be a professor of all three of those things, uh and her books, make obvious, how much_ how deep and wide is her knowledge in these different fields and others, like medicine. she's taught at Cornell, since completing her education at the University of Rochester, Boston College, and the University of Virginia. most of us in this room know Professor Brumberg as the author of The Body Project, An Intimate History of American Girls, and um we do have it here courtesy of Shaman Drum and you're invited to uh meet with, Professor Brumberg after the lecture, uh if you'd like to have her sign your book or talk to her a little bit more. many of you probably also know that she's the author of Fasting Girls, the Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa As a Modern Disease, and Mission for Life, the Judson Family, an American Evangelical Culture. she has truly distinguished herself, as an authority both on the experience of adolescence among girls and the particular developmental v- vulnerabilities girls face. the hallmark of her work is the combination of rich psychological insight, acute social analysis, and creative historical research, all delivered in the books, with a beautiful writing style. in her recent work, she is clearly interested in the ordinary vicissitudes, of adolescence for girls in contemporary America as well as in the past. she retains, though a concern about the potential for the deeper trouble, that some girls end up in, as she was uh exploring in Fasting Girls and anorexia. Professor Brumberg has been recognized with teaching awards from her institution, as well as by a Guggenheim Fellowship, grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and Rockefeller Foundation, as well as the MacDowell Colony Residency. she's worked on a number of public history projects, i think part of her commitment to, the broader issues of citizenship that, some, academics are concerned about. she's consulted on a film project on the history of the Girl Scouts, an exhibit on the history of asylums in New York state, and historical site interpretation for museum educators. she's currently working on a project on girls diaries, which doesn't surprise me at all because she used girls diaries in the pr- Body Project with great success. so i know i'm looking forward to her new work. meanwhile i'm eager as i'm sure you are to hear what she has to say tonight, because i know many people have shared my own experience of having read the Body Project, and having found that Linda Kerber was correct when she wrote on the book jacket, that i'm, delighted to be in Arb- in Ann Arbor. i always feel that there are connections between Michigan and Cornell, um having admitted women about the same time, um, and delighted to see how strong and vital your, um, opportunities are here for the study of gender, uh at both the Center and in Women's Studies so, it's been_ it's really nice for me. and i wanna thank also, um, uh, i i'm delighted to be part of the Vivian Shaw, lecture series. so lemme start what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna talk for a while, and then i'm gonna show some slides and then i'm gonna come back and, talk a little bit more, just to give you a a road map. um, a century ago, American women were lacing themselves into corsets, and teaching their adolescent daughters to do the same thing. but today's teens, some with rings in their eyebrows and noses, shop for thong bikinis on their own and their middle class parents are likely to be uninvolved, until the moment when the credit card bill arrives in the mail. now this this transition in the experience of young women tells us a great deal about what's happened, to female adolescents in the contemporary world. it's also kind of a useful imaginative backdrop for my remarks to you this evening which are based on, The Body Project, an Intimate History of American Girls. a little bit of intellectual biography, first. in nineteen eighty-eight when i published Fasting Girls which was a book about the history of anorexia nervosa, i was already thinking about the relationship between American culture, and adolescent female bodies. those who've read the book know that cultural imperatives, particularly the link in the twentieth century between slimness, and female perfection, are an important part of my explanation of the increasing incidence of eating disorders. however although my work is very much in the social constructionist vein, i never argued, that anorexia nervosa was caused by culture alone. there clearly are some intervening personal, psychological and familial variables, that explain the etiology of anorexia nervosa, as well as other eating disorders. but in the years since the publication of Fasting Girls, i gave a great deal of thought to what it is about American culture, that makes female adolescence so difficult. important work by Carol Gilligan Mary Heifer Peggy Orenstein, the (Satfers) i'm sure some of you have read this material. it all sounds a clear alarm, for American girls more so than boys adolescence is a time of declining confidence, silence, and danger. and many of you in the audience may also be familiar with the unsettling fact, that, uh studies show that until puberty, women really are the healthier sex, by all measures. mental health measures as well as, biomedical measures. now because so much contemporary social science literature suggests, that the body is a serious problematic for girls, beginning in puberty, i decided to focus my attention, on the adolescent female body, to give it a history, and to map the ways in which the inevitable physical transformations, of this stage of life, have been negotiated in different generations, of American girls. so instead of writing a history of bulimia, which some people expected me to do, i moved away from pathology, to normative experience. my new book rests on the assumption, that the female adolescent body has a history. maybe a distinctly American one. and that what happens to girls, in the process of physical and emotional development changes, to some extent, over time. i say to some extent because i want to acknowledge the tension, between, what is hard-wired into the organism, and into the developmental process, and what is culturally constructed. unlike other history books, i begin with a biological event and that event is menarche, the first period. and the narrative then moves through a profoundly important sequence of physical developments, such as the appearance of breasts the eruptions of acne, the emergence of sexuality. body parts usually don't appear in works in history, unless they're lost on the battlefield, but they're circle pins what? oh my god 	1
OFC300JU149.json	okay you feel th- as though you're in a lab or,  (i don't know) mm, it wasn't too much it didn't take me too long to just, use the same word i just, i'd say the hardest part yeah was changing the sentences. trying to make 'em all fit again. okay okay. but the rhythm seemed to work right and, mhm     okay. now, part of part of what you need to do is to look back at the beginning of this and say, w- how are you using the word elegy? and how can poetry be a   i was figuring i mean, it's a form of it cuz i mean it represents it, because it is, i mean it's not a short story it's not a novel, right mkay, but but again if by definition an elegy is a kind of poem, then it can't then poetry can't be a   mkay oh okay where's that?    mhm mhm because the while would make it, need more, (kind of, the) okay the wh- the while makes it dependent. yeah just poetry (xx) again huh? right. now th- that's perfectly alright. because, because what you've done is to make this dependent this part, is is dependent and the comma here makes a difference, but, when you say while poems are used to release this pain, they can also be used for paying respect to the dead. um, you can you can imagine, some people work uh, with the principle that's called sentence combining. when they want to when they want to get students to learn how to, to get variety into their, language and into their sentences they do sentence combining which will, give them the opportunity to reshape sentences almost endlessly. and so you could reshape this one but this is a this is a fine sentence because, you've you've said while this is true, this is also true. um, that's that's not a difficult (xx) mhm  mhm mm  it's just um, taken away not as much emphasized on, if the reader could really make uh, i mean if the writer could really make the reader feel what they saying. okay, uh can you think of another way of saying that? can you think of another word, a single word that would do that? taken away by the writer's ability t- okay taken away by  mm, hmm,   okay yeah okay mm, because i, i took it as_ i mean he was using, just grass but, it was mainly about horses and i figure horses eat the grass so, mhm but but what do you mean by connotation...?  mhm yeah i mean that's what i was thinking a implied meaning right? mhm  mhm, okay hm? from grass? i didn't get that. okay,  i mainly just got the animals eat the grass, that's what i was thinking so, okay okay. okay. um... and here where, where you're talking about the simile and you see that as the major figure, then i would, then i would put the quotation in there and, okay   mkay yeah, that's fine. i mean that that really does break that down otherwise it'd just_ so that if you if you put the colon in there, and say this is what i mean by what i've just said. it just sharpens it. it gets you, it seems like there's a point. whereas the sentence that you had before just drags on. and we can't really see where the where the point is is coming. um  what um, what (xx) do you need? right. uh, or he's given a scenario that doesn't require much, in, in the way of, extensive analysis. i mean jus- get it that that short. because that's the point that, that you're making. okay. i think when i be, trying to stretch the paper, uhuh oh okay right, right. and the way_ it seems to me that that the one thing that this paper lacks, that where you could've lengthened it without any kind of padding at all, would would have been through the use of quotations. that there're there're places here where, i'm sort of looking for the example you've given me the general description,  okay. is that is that helpful at all? (xx) yeah concrete detail. out of the text pretty much huh? right and and then just, that that, connection between, poetry and THE elegy or the relation between poetry and elegiac poetry, is the one that just needs to be clear, all the way all the way through. mkay okay  mhm. yeah. this must of been the hardest i worked on a paper, in a while. is it? yeah  good. mhm. English two-thirty-nine, we had like a ten page paper i got a B-plus on it. in Chinese we had about a six page paper i got a, B-plus A-minus. okay so, mm,  mhm   okay. yeah because i don't think i don't think i'm coming down, terribly hard on this paper, uh and in fact i'm worrying about myself that i'm that i'm being too lenient a grader mm      yeah i think it would help. okay a review session. okay. alright, well... work away and uh, we'll see how how things go on the final. but i but i just wanted to, let you know in a more explicit way what i was, troubled with here, and why i wasn't, why the grade wasn't, maybe where you would want it to be. okay, what i could try this again? if you'd like that'd be great. okay    okay okay. good. would you have um, any suggestion on how i can make this better? mhm right... and you were reading this, back in this section on sounds? um, yep... same type of thing. (mm) i think i can find it this way. mhm   okay wonderful. thanks for having me. should we listen to ourselves? okay. (xx) okay, uh, the paper that i redid was the self-analysis, right right and this is the, that's the    the one that you_ that i turned back the other day. that that's it right here. okay how 'bout the one on,  the elegy. was that the most recent paper? mhm okay good. yeah okay. um you mean from like high school? no,  well where did you go to high school? i went to uh_ are you familiar with the area? mhm okay   who was the instructor? the instruc- it was a G-S-I uh i, don't remember her name. she was, Romanian i don't know if that really rings a bell. i don't know. no yeah i didn't think it would but uh, it was a it was like a night class so like uh it was it was_ i just liked it it was a good class. and then uh, i needed to take uh, like in my requirement for art and design you need to take six credits of English. so right now i'm taking American Lit Intro to American Lit, and Intro to Poetry. okay  and how are you doing in that other course? uh  okay okay  uh it's uh, it's um, Boeching or how do you s- Beechum Beechum that's it. okay okay. alright and in this class, things aren't going quite that well. right, yeah,  okay okay   i think that's true. i i also wonder, because i don't usually work with a text like this so this is a bit of a surprise to me  mhm  right yeah     okay yeah right to make sense  right i i i'm i'm  right you'd more or less  okay. one of the great helps of understanding, Acquainted with the Night was, the time we spent discussing symbolism. uhuh  yeah, do you sure and almost anytime you do that you you're going to be less clear than     mkay    okay right mhm   mhm yeah. i could've easily just said the rhyme scheme_ are you talking about this one right here? mhm okay.  get that out of there right right. you could put due to her um, yeah avoid due to   okay most of, someone once, pointed out that that almost all of Emily Dickinson's poems can be, um, can be, uh sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas. that that the rhyme scheme is is does duplicate itself so much, that that you could just, sing it to that tu- sing all of them to that tune. um, okay um, it, it's not logical to say that something is both unique and almost nonexistent. uh right? when you_ if if it's unique we're going to remark on it and it's gonna be significant enough that it clearly is gonna have, an existe- if you look if you look at her rhyme scheme, it is pretty regular,     mhm  oh yeah i i understand. okay well, i wouldn't i wouldn't mind your sharpening, the Dickinson and Hopkins and maybe rather than redo it i'd, i'm not a, uh i think that much of the time when we ask students to go back and and do something over again um, they would be better off moving forward. mhm  mkay    yeah, that  nice.    okay. yeah. what time is it? how are you coming with that Larkin poem?    we'll see where where we  i think it's a_ the first time i heard that poem i heard a friend of mine read it, in a in a reading that i had arranged at the uh, at the A-P,     uhuh  it's it's a, it's an unusual move and you don't know whether he's trying to, to finesse the whole question   no i no i i actually found uh, i found a ton of poetry online from him. okay right no (well i) he's pretty direct in, (yeah)    no he's talking to you, yeah yeah you can definitely make some sense out of it so good thanks  get yourself a drink of water before you so the um, just just to remind_ like the the final is the twenty-fifth right? right okay just i think in the afternoon  good so what are we gonna talk about? i was hoping maybe um we could talk about, maybe you said you might have those sheets ready today? oh that's right and you're not gonna be here. i'm not gonna be here on um, on Tuesday i'm going to Florida. okay  yeah. okay, if you go_  prank call. i hope they're not starting to solicit here i mean i get enough of those at home. three-seventy-two (next page,) it's down at the bottom of the page. doo doo doo, sonnet_ which one? seventy-three. mkay. three-eighty-seven To His Coy Mistress, which we haven't read. Coy and His Mistress? (His Coy) To His Coy Mistress. page three-eighty-seven four-twenty-eight The Windhover. Among Schoolchildren page four-thirty-three. it's the top of the next page. mm mm two-seventy-nine. Dov- i'm gonna answer this one more time Dover Beach on two-twenty-five. two-twenty-five  i need to get a new pen. here's one thank you um, i'll ask you to respond to some some short questions. um they may be questions drawn from the the textbook part of Western Wind, uh where i where i might say, identify, um the synecdoche in the following lines. uh, identify um, the the the guiding metaphor in this stanza. identify some other kind of poetic feature um, where i'm just asking you to, to demonstrate to me that you've got something like a critical vocabulary that you've picked up during the course (of things.) those aren't aren't usually very uh, very difficult. uh, i might even give you some lines, of poetry and ask you to identify them. but i wouldn't i wouldn't ask you to identify them ju- with no context. and the context might be, match, the following line, from the poem from which it's taken. or here are some here are some cl- here are the closing lines of five poems and, wh- match them with poems in the column to the right. where you just have to do some some recall. that's not a difficult part of what we do and it's it's not really central to to this. then i probably would would give you um, one or two short essays, that will be based on, either the poems that that we've read here or, one of those poems set over against a poem that you haven't seen, seen before. uh i might i might say, um, here's a poem by Hopkins that you haven't that you haven't seen before what are the qualities that you find in this poem that are also apparent in The Windhover? which is one of the poems i'll have asked you to review. so that so that you might have some things ready to say about almost any poem that we've we've done. then my typical, final question is an hour long essay where i give you two poems and i ask you to to, in some way bring those poems together. they might be poems, about a similar subject, uh they might be poems uh from the beginning and the end of a of a particular writer's career, uh they might be poems that that are, in the same form, but use that form differently or with greater or less success. i might_ i can imagine even saying here are, here are two sonnets uh, given what you know about the sonnet and how it can, can be used to create an argument, which of these poems is more successful in achieving in achieving_ that's a pretty narrow question it's a lot narrower than one i would, than one i would ask. um, it is much more likely to be a kind of thematic um, thematic question. kay and then_ i don't know when you're coming back but when, when you come back you should check with Laura and see when i'm doing the review session. alright  okay. mhm so it's likely that i might do the review session on the twenty-third. alright. and with the um the beginning with the short response (at the end with,) the um you know the given the i_ lines to identify and match do you think it's gonna be uh, with the checked poems or those gonna be with different poems  okay  alright. well that's, that's good to know. i don't think so. i think that that_ so long you know you've been keeping up, right along and, doing the work as we've we've moved through it, so there shouldn't be any surprises. there shouldn't be any surprises in in terms of the kinds of things i'm, i'm looking for. if you imagine yourself, conducting one of these discussions and conducting it in, in the way that seem has seemed most successful to you, then that's where (we'll be.) okay   sure   the humor mm no i actually i um, i actually did a performance at the um museum, it was like uh, this last weekend and this was actually a part of like my performance  okay  oh okay, okay (more than anything) and who taught that course? it was uh Olabayo Olaniyi a, traveling artist from Nigeria. oh okay sure. yeah, oh that's good. yeah it was   through the Art  yeah yeah, i'm not sure where it's gonna go but okay. happy to do it. yeah well you have a nice weekend a good happy Easter. yes thank you. oh i should_ well (xx) should i have you fill out a, an evaluation form? we'll skip  and i'll (xx) i'll do it later. alright alright thank you. good 	1
STP285SU013.json	first i uh, i couldn't figure out, what i was gonna, like give you guys, and, i always fall back, on the same thing, which is candy. so... mhm  can i say something really quick? yeah i don't know if everyone who's here heard about this recording thing last week but we're taping, and if someone doesn't wanna be taped, please say so before you start and we'll shut it off. okay. um, well, before we start does anybody have any questions concerns comments, questions? uh yeah? how do we um get our curriculums back from you? i will leave them outside my door in a box. um, i will probably, i'll probably, put everybody's stuff if i have like, any papers, that i have that you may have turned in, i'll put it in one of these um, i'm gonna present my own own selection today, and uh what i did, uh the title of my project, or paper is called John, i know you told me a while ago um, when you were doing this that, you're_ you've been a mem- been a subscriber or a member? subscriber, since, eighty-nine eighty-eight i think you said? yeah about ninety.  yeah. do you feel that there's been a change in image, of Sports Illustrated? um like are they being more_ are they putting more in terms of alcohol are they doing more in terms of swimsuit issues are they doing more oh yeah, this, tha- i thought that was um, the swimsuit issue in fact, uh each year, they've put in more swimsuits, and it's been less the magaz- the actual issue has been less, less sports, the swimsuit issue has been less sports each year, and to this year to my surprise i got the issue and, i'm looking through it, i looked fo- i'm looking for the, looking i'm looking for the s- the articles to read, um, alright thank you thank you our next victim is Mary. okay um, i'm gonna be doing my curriculum guide and i'm gonna go through it um, first i'm gonna go, um go over how i approached choosing my topic and then why i chose it and then i'm gonna go through my lesson plan and some of my resources. um, first off um, i wanted to do a topic related to science because i'm in the elementary education program, and i'm majoring in science so i wanted something that i could, you know hopefully use in the future. so um, i didn't know exactly, specifically what topic in science i wanted to do so, i went to the Ann Arbor library and i, i looked through books, like toward the reference area and then i came across a debate i wasn't even aware that they had this but they have like, um set of curriculum, um, like the standard curriculums for like science and math for the Ann Arbor, Public Schools so i looked through them, and then, i looked under like, um the elementary grades of, and it was like required like, they listed the science topics that um, were required in their science curriculum and i chose environment because i figured that it would be, a good topic to use for science and to like bring, multicultural issues in too. and um, let's see i chose, environment because um what did you think of the Ann Arbor curriculum, for science? um, it w- it was pretty, it was pretty similar to what, i had, as an elementary student and so, it was, pretty on target i guess. i mean i- like the whole curriculum guide was like a huge binder and it, listed_ it was pretty much like a package of like, activities and like day to day lessons and stuff so i pretty much used it sort of like a model, because i mean it had like a concept map and everything, so it was pretty well-organized (i thought.) thank you our next contestant is Julia. um, i'm gonna do my own selection. i, for my own selection i just kind of grabbed a bunch of random pictures, and told a bunch of random stories that had to do with multiculturalism from my life so this is probably gonna be kind of, random as well just kind of, shouting stuff out. i um... when i was younger i never really had very much exposure to anything multicultural i, i've always kind of been in the majority in a very, homogeneous society it feels like and i never really, thought about anything, that we've discussed in this class i mean i'm sure i did at some point you hear things on the news and the radio but it's not like it was ever a big issue in my life, but um, one thing that's kind of brought me into this whole, multicultural train of thought is the fact that i really really loved France, for no apparent reason. really really wanted to go to France knew no French people knew, no one having to do with France. so when i graduated from high school i went there for a year, and um, and all kinds of crazy things happened, you guys may have heard me mention, a couple in this class before but, there are a few i mentioned in my own selection and, a few i didn't, that um, that i wanted to tell you about. there was one time and i- this is one of the most distinct memories i have, it was really, well i'll tell you what happened first i guess i was i was in this class this senior year class, um, and in France you go to the same classes with all the same people all the time and one of the classes that we had was history and geography. and i was all psyched to be studying about like Napoleon and Louis the fourteenth and all this stuff and i walk in and they're talking about Woodrow Wilson. My Lai? My Lai was it? My Lai yeah is that what it was okay so we watch this video on this right and of course i knew about it, but i'm sitting in this room with thirty other, students my age like friends of mine French kids watching this movie and it was so, tense and i don't know if i was overinterpreting, i think i was to a certain extent but, cuz it's something that will make you tense anyway watching something like that but, of course i'm American in this room, and i remember people kind of turning around looking at me and, and having this feeling that, that i was the one responsible for this to a certain extent or thank you, um. Melissa, (xx) RESTRICTED thank you i actually have another question RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED questions? um, next contestant is Dave. um... m- i'm doing my own selection, um, basically the night before this was due i rented, Dangerous Minds, which is a... a movie that i kinda, me and my roommates all said it was a pretty cheesy movie, um, you know a, sexy ex-marine teacher, wins over her uh, urban classroom through karate. i thought it was kinda cheesy. um, and then that Coolio song was kinda, annoying, uh RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED (well) it kinda got overplayed, for a while. um... but then after i was, after i got done watching it i kinda, realized that that could be me someday, um that i could get thrown into that classroom, um... and... i don't know i was kinda, it kinda intimidates me cuz i don't know what i would do, you know if i was in her place, um cuz i don't know karate. what do you feel is one strength that you um, that you see yourself bringing to a classroom? (what?) what, what do you think is, could you um,  just like, energy? i don't know... i don't know. what do you mean strength like? (xx) i think you talked about it in your paper in terms of um, in terms of Dangerous Minds what's the strength, that you could see yourself bringing... i don't remember exactly (xx) i'm not sure. alright thank you. yeah. uh, Bob. (this is) my own selection uh, i kind of talked about my transition from Grand Rapids to Ann Arbor. and i talked about Escalante and Stand and Deliver but, everyone's just, letting everything out so screw that. um... wait, what? Hoop- my last name's Hooper and see they're like okay Hooperstein, like, the people who were s- who were, prejudiced or who'd use this, this term. whatever. um... i and i was just really reaching for the different like there was a foreign exchange student in my class and from Germany and i was like a different kid you know he's, so i i, he ended up living with me. that's how close he got to my_ i got really close with him and he didn't like the family he lived with i had him move in with me, got really close i was just, really uh, chasing, the different and just... that the community uh, the Grandville community just wasn't, multicultural i r- most people over there like, were raised, all their parents were raised in Grandville a lot of 'em and, their grandparents lived in Grandville and, a lot of my friends, went to Grand Valley which is right near Grandville, got married to someone from Grandville, have kids in Grandville, it just they just don't get out of this little bubble. they're all talking about the bubble. and uh... so then i came to Ann Arbor. i think, that was a big deal uh, i remember the first week before classes i was walking around with a girl from, she didn't go to Grandville from Grand Rapids and uh, and there was several students walking around with yarmulkes on and she asked me what fraternity, that, what fraternity wears those hats? and i'm like, you know, um, Sheila um, i'm i'm in the School of Library Science, and, some of the projects i've had to do i've had to interview a media specialist and one of the things they always say is nobody knows what i do, nobody thinks i do anything around here, so um i'm gonna tell you about my, my uh curriculum guide here so that i can let you know kinda what we do. um, in fact my project has something to do about holidays i forget who it was mentioned holidays (xx) um... the basic premise of the project we're go- it's for ninth graders, um who have just come into the high school and so it's kind of an introduction to, um media center and all that we're going to um, develop a permanent resource for the media center on holidays, um, they're gonna be divided into groups and the groups are gonna go and develop the history of a holiday we'll have six different holidays, and then each person in the group will have a um, personal paper on what it feels like to celebrate that holiday, and then we're gonna have pictures, um that represent the holiday and all this is gonna go on the web and we're doing this in conjunction with um, schools around the world, um Southeast Asia, um i forgot where i said i was gonna do it South Africa Japan India, and one other one. can't remember what it was. um so we could get, th- what the holidays they celebrate what ones we celebrate the same and what the differences are the similarities um, one of the things i think'll be interesting is that there are holidays we all celebrate like New Year's, um what do they think the history of that holiday is as compared to what you know we think the history of that holiday is? and that probably comes from back when i was in school when we were in the middle of the cold war, um, they used to tell us about how Russia had rewritten history, to make it, go their way, you know which, probably was a mistake because um i'm a part of the hippie generation and as soon as they told us that we started wondering what our government was telling us, cuz you can't tell somebody a government can rewrite history and then not make 'em think twice about their own government, so it'll be interesting to find out um, if we all view the history of these holidays the same. now um, the library teacher doesn't do a lot of instruction, and the instruction that she does works better if she does it in conjunction with, other ar- subject areas. um it used to be you'd go into the library and she'd hand you a sheet, and she'd go go find the Dewey numbers on these or she'd hand you some authors and say go find your books or something it had nothing to do with what you were doing in your life or your classroom, and, it works a lot better if we tie it in with the classroom so... to develop the histories of_ for my part they have to come to the library they have to use at least three different types of, reference book sources, we've got handbooks almanacs encyclopedias regular books, dictionaries, on holidays, um and in working in conjunction with the English teacher because they're writing the uh_ i_ you know if i have an English teacher to actually work with i could do this better i had to make up all this, cuz i'm working by myself and i don't really know what you guys do or what you'd call it but they're gonna have to write this informative or factual paper, with a bibliography, on the histories. and then when they come back in to do their um, personal, um observances of the celebration, um, what we're gonna do is work on word processing, the computer lab is in the library so, i'm gonna teach 'em word processing, and in the English_ it's tied in with the English teacher who's teaching 'em how to do a descriptive paper. and, then we're gonna um, i have to have 'em come in and teach 'em how to turn all this into H-T-M-L to put it on the web, i'm gonna have 'em come in and, use different references to find pictures and how to scan 'em onto the web i have to teach 'em that, then at the end when all this is done and all the schools have everything up on the web, it's a nice web resource but we wanted something permanent for our library, so we're gonna work with the art teacher, and i'll go in there and i'll bring books in and explain how the cover of the book, and the endpapers of the book and the design of the pages reflect the content of the book, and then in their art class they're all gonna design a cover and everything for our holiday book, and then we'll have um, in the display cases we'll set up all their projects and then a couple weeks later we'll have a vote, on whose gets to be the cover of our permanent book in our library. so the kind of library skills that they're learning are um use of different information resources the ability to make a bibliography, use of equipment computers printers scanners word processing and H-T-M-L software, gathering analyzing and synthesizing information and then presenting information to others because we've got a couple group projects going on, um, for me they're gonna have to present to others, what resources they used, um, how much inf- what type of information they had how useful they were for this project. um, for the English teacher they're doing informative descriptive papers bibliographies um and for the art teacher they've got an art project. eventually this resource, will probably be used um in the social studies, um, either when they're looking at a s- a country in particular or just looking at societies, compare and contrast the kind of holidays we do and that kind of stuff. um, it has multicultural implications because they're working (in) diverse local groups, they're establishing contact with global groups, they're collaborating with others, um it's making a concrete experience of this abstract notion that we want them to get of a unified whole coming out of diverse pieces, and perspectives coming together, um they're making a book from diverse groups, um a unit plan has been made from diverse um subject areas, um and they'll be comparing and contrasting their perspectives on how (xx) similarities and differences. so, um, in conclusion uh th- your school librarian would like to hear from you, the stuff that she has to teach works better if she teach- teaches it with you, she needs to know what your um unit plans are for the year what your subjects are, this would also help her to have the right resources ready in that library, helps her with collection development, um, if if the social studies department's coming to me and the English department's coming to me, i might see where those two could work together on something maybe they didn't know they were both doing the same thing, um it happens sometimes the teacher will design an assignment which really, is almost unworkable because of, maybe we don't have the resources for it, or it's too narrow, and if he leaves it like that he's gonna get thirty papers that all sound the same, um so we can help you redesign it to make it bigger maybe it's too big you need to make it smaller, um when i did this curriculum guide for the um, first part they have to do the histories and they have to use a lot of those different kind of resources. i got together with the public librarian to find out what resources were there cuz, a great percentage of your kids are gonna be going to the public library, and her and i put the list together, so um they can find things in my library or her library, and that's an important thing for you to remember too um, public librarian would love to hear from you also, um if she knows what's going on in the schools they can do their collection development better they can have the resources necessary, um maybe she's only got, five or ten books on this uh project that  you want to do, if you don't tell her you're doing it the first ten kids come in and take those books, next fifteen kids have nothing to work with so she can put 'em on reserve, she can do inter-library loan, um, if she knows ahead of time what the assignment is she understands what it is, um in one of my other classes i i i did a project on this, and i used the anecdote of the little boy who waited to the last minute to do his homework of course, and he runs to dad and goes dad dad i gotta go to the library, um i'm supposed supposed to find pictures of what the Does somebody have a question? RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED no no one else can erase 'em but the school may not keep 'em. there's_ you must_ have you ever done any work on the web and you've put in a a web RESTRICTED RESTRICTED it hasn't been kept up, um RESTRICTED jump both feet into the New Year i guess, um in Japan, nobody works on the first three days of the New Year. they have a little, a holiday three-day holiday. uh the period called and i don't know how to say this if anybody else does S H O U G A T S shougats or something like that. shougats originally referred to the whole of January which made me wonder did they not work for the whole of January? i don't know. uh but now it just refers to those three days and on those days they go to shrines visit friends drink sake, eat special New Year dishes, um the kids uh, play battledore shuttlecock and fly kites, uh they hang pine boughs in the doorways and (xx) the descent of the gods, um this pine decoration's left in place from January the first to the seventh, this's a little kid that wrote this and then in parentheses he goes 	1

(oh) okay. and then today's date, and... the seventeenth today's the seventeenth, okay and then you just um, go through that... now who has read this before? your teacher or uh people in your class, or both. both.    oh okay. okay?  mhm mhm  oh   but someone, um, in a_ classmate, mhm  i think i would just take this out  right. cuz i started just uh right. right  right. when um in agreement, mhm  mhm.   mm okay okay? what was your problem?  um it seems a little mysterious because you don't actually   um i mean do i need to? well, it seems a it seems a, a little mysterious  oh okay. you know what i'm    okay. um it's a kidney disease oh    i see. okay? okay. and then you just go on when i heard the ne- ne- y- that's fine    right. right... okay.  that's wonderful. that's quite a triumph for you. okay. i think just saying that, um, you're_ tha- f- you can finish it with, um mhm okay?  thank you. um, just a few places where,  mhm mhm  i mean i know i have like major problems with like prepositions  mhm  i know.  real-  right.  mhm. okay right. okay... did he give them one bell or lots of bells?  maybe i have to look it over.     okay. um you say he might be religious Columbus might be religious, mm put it in one   okay mm how_ how long is the appointment? each appointment? um they usually run b- about twenty-five minutes. oh okay. sorry it's reasonable to assume that he knew that somebody would be reading his log that's for sure. oh yeah there also may have been a, convention about wr- writing in logs that you only recorded facts and not feelings. mhm he did both?   how like he was like talking about, how he'd thank God all the time and stuff like that okay you've said this al- several times about not_  mhm. is that the conclusion? or um every  mkay. or maybe i should shorten it? or um, how long is your paper supposed to be? um i think four to five well you might be able to shorten it and take out some of those, p-    um i have one question about this   oh right.   yeah i  okay   okay.  um, you need_ you're i- if you_ while i'm reading you might fill out these things which is the consent form and the information okay. but first tell me what what your as- what your assignment is and, what i'm going to be reading. um, it's an analysis. and  oh okay. you've been in here before right? uhuh you were in here to_ or you wrote something about the um about the um, the march. right. right the Ku Klux Klan  it went well. oh good. yeah. uhuh. excellent, yep uhuh. alright so this is um three different people, in a traffic jam huh? yeah. okay. i guess this is the way this is gonna go okay this is good description. uh'uh. so, it sounds a little phony to say a forty-year-old man when you're just looking in the in the van should i say middle-aged? yeah.  yeah i thought about that but then    yeah you know? mhm you just want to, try to be as, clinical, in your analysis as you can be. okay. okay? so and s- and and and as direct and precise so u- u- yeah that's something that i wouldna noticed.  now this is the n- another car,  maybe you should say... okay. to signal that you're going to another driver now okay. this pretty much explains, yeah. ah oh.  i'm trying to say that they didn't need to like talk him into, driving on the shoulder of the road. okay. but  okay. to... attempt maybe you should say here. okay mkay you need a semicolon here. okay okay now you can signal this is another person by saying nearby mkay. you don't know that it filled the van, their laughter, they laughed okay. you wouldn't see it anymore right? right. yeah e- either one is okay. oh. that's okay? right. okay. i wouldn't put this in here.  mkay... um you you uh you give that impression already without saying it. okay you know you give the impression of what you're thinking that_ about the mother and her treatment of the children but when you actually come out and say it, it's almost too obvious okay so it  okay okay okay now you_ now that you're getting into interpretation of what you think you have to be careful that you don't jump to conclusions, okay? so,  okay how you're accounting for this behavior. okay um (or) i can work something out there. yeah okay. mhm. and maybe it's a good car and maybe  well, tha- um if if i mean, people tend to buy what they can afford, uhuh. mhm right.  so, um... so at this point... um, this is your impression right mhm so, there's a problem with this analysis the way you're laying it out. okay. just jumping from, this is what i see so this is what it must be... um... even here where you say, okay. so, how to get around this problem, um y- you can indicate that, this, suggests some stereotypes in your mind. right. right at the outset. okay. um... and that in looking at h- at th- him and at these other people, these are the conclusions you draw because of...  you need to get that up front. okay. i'll i'll put that in the first sentence then when i fix it. okay mhm mkay mhm and you want to um mhm um you don't want to appear to other people to be overly aggressive or inconsiderate or  well, kinda the point is that um, people act a certain way because of, what their life consists of like,   okay. right. but everybody has pressures and  well i was just saying that i'm the  yeah. okay. that we're all just shaped by s- uh society and there's nothing we can do about it. okay. um... alright then you could... you could, you know start this um... with a kind of rhetorical question. are my assumptions, jus- my assumptions about these drivers justified? mhm. um and then you can say, um well m- maybe not n- maybe not down to the last, detail, mhm right. right? mhm okay. okay... or it boxes people in okay. i think your descriptions are really good, you just need to be careful that you separate out what you're imagining about these  okay. thank you very much. you're very welcome. um what is this?  uhuh. oh good. yeah, what are you gonna do the rest of the summer now? you  where's home? Chicago. so i'm excited. well that'll be fun   yeah i know how you feel. okay well good luck on your paper. alright thank you. okay  	1
STP125JG050.json	we, we have two sites you haven't seen the (xx) before have you? no (um. or Mark?) okay. we have two sites, one is on North Campus which uh, if uh this is the, Pierpont Commons the Media Union and the bell tower, this is Bonisteel here, and Murfin goes up the hill here, uh so the site is really, largely where the current parking lot is, to the north of Pierpont Commons. or that slope. that whole area was open for, choice. and the other site is um, in town on Central Campus, uh State Street is here, um Student Union, West Quad, (looks exactly like) um, in looking at the uh, North Campus, we found that, it's quite obvious um, that there's a suburban feel to, the environment and, what we've tried to do with our scheme, uh was kind of two things. one was try to reduce the, um suburban feel like the Media Union has, um, on this side of the street to the, the front of the building and, as well as somehow try to, address, the um, quadrangle, uh which is, uh presently which presently is starting to look like it's forming. um, and we realized that our building doesn't complete the quad and, uh we're trying to attempt to, somehow, um get a sense of a new, way of designing, uh buildings for, uh, North Campus. so what we've done basically is try to, um bring over the Murfin, Road and, have our building, interact with the street as well as with the quad. um in a larger uh... master plan, if you will. RESTRICTED yeah Murfin, currently goes straight down, so what we've done is we RESTRICTED um, let me go through this uh, programmatically if uh George, i can't let me go through uh, programmatically. the uh, the main entrance uh, to our building, is where the roof, where there's an existing roof where this, this is the uh ground floor plan, where this is the Pier Commons, and there's the um, existing roof that exists there right now, we're planning on keeping that and using that as the main entrance into the building. whereby, you can sorta see it in this view right here, and um, so the main entrance, um is like, this point right here. it sorta edges you into, a what you call, vestibule, because it's sorta separated from the rest of the building as a, sort of very public, uh primary ci- uh, circulation space. now this is one of, one of three that we have, um, this is one finger primary uh circulation could be allowed, publicly as long as this finger right here, um, when i describe this finger uh um, my uh concept was that, these fingers which is the circulation space, (were) sort of um uh cocooned in the studio space, cuz we thought that studio space was, was very much, um, very much uh, the the sacred space of an architecture building so we wanted to, to really um, to uh enclose it and, sort of make this space uh, you know not necessarily, um closed to the public, but maybe certain parts open to the public but, um something that you, you can go to but, can't really see from the exterior of the building. so, s- you enter through the building, and um, and um, these are the two fingers as i mentioned before. now in the ground floor, we have all of our public spaces as soon as you enter you get an exhibition space right here. um where we'd have a coffee shop, we have a lecture hall auditorium, a public I-T-D space which, not necessarily is for the, computing space for the whole, School of Architecture but, more for public use. we have a, computer (xx) upstairs i mentioned. and, around this other um, circulation space, on the ground floor we have a mechanical space right here. i'll talk a little bit more about that afterwards but on the right-hand side of it we get our, computer classes areas um, you know you get your seminars right here, you got your workshop right here. and on the other finger of the circulation space, we get our G-S-I labs, we get our high-bay spaces this is them right here. now on the ground floor, what we did what we decided to do for the parking was that, we decided um, we're gonna use the existing parking but we're gonna cover it so there is, we're saying that th- there isn't gonna be any sort of an, excavation we're building from the existing grade up. so, we're we decided that we're gonna have parking, within our building, coming off of a street, off of Murfin, entering into as a one-way, coming back out, and out back out that way out to Murfin. as our, as programmatically for the parking spaces that are required. um, ways of getting on- onto the second floor now there's a couple of ways of doing that. uh from the main entrance, there is an accessibility, of, uh a set of stairs and elevator here, or, you can go up um, a one-hundred-and-eighty-foot ramp, one-to-twelve ratio scale for the handicap accessibility up until the studio space. uh, you don't quite get right into studio space as soon as you get up. um, you get into this other catwalk that runs back the other way, which, actually connects you to, this other piece which is another sort of face of our building, which is across the street, which um, is the admin, uh offices on the ground-floor plan, and_ but when you come up, the ramp onto the second floor, you bridge across, you get directly in- into faculty offices, which went two stories up from that, and one more top for G-S-Is, PhDs... so. um, getting back to over here, um we get back into the catwalk right here. this coffee space runs two stories. so, you can actually access um, studio-level floor, from the studio-level floor down into the coffee shop into this two-story area space. so, basically, you get up to this point right here. right here, um, where we have our coffee, um copy center sorry, area, um sorta publicly um, publicly located, and then after we get an extension of our studio space which is on one floor. so an existing building on this side is only a two-story building. where studio spaces are subdivided... and we get our cre- we get our c- uh computer (pool areas.) uh which is uh, interconnected within, within those studio spaces. now that's one part of the studio, but... um the crit spaces are located right here, facing uh, and so now, this view right here. alright that view is actually sort of standing right here, and looking up that way. so i'm getting a view into studio, but i_ you get a you get a view also of the crit spaces that's located right here, on this other, um circulation space. whereby on the same level as the studio space, i bridge across, over these um, over these three bridges that exist one two and three, over into, our classroom area, um, which is another, which is sorta separated from studio yet somewhat, connected by these bridges... and um, we have our typical, all the, the fire exit uh requirements um, two hundred feet (there'll be a) fire exit (stair.) um... yeah, um let me just explain some of the views if you can't read it this is the main entrance view up so as soon as you enter, you get this round going up... you get your exhibition space will be right here, and you get your auditorium, lecture hall, and your I-T-D in on the corner. so you can kinda... could you talk (xx)  this is fr- yeah, this is looking Murfin looking south and that's the Media Union, and that's the Pier Commons in the background, and this is looking from the engineering side, so this is the Media Union on that side right there this is the bell tower, and that's the architecture building right there... um we wanted um, i guess you can see if, i wouldn't wanna leave admin. the admin was, meant to be this space whereby it's, i know it you know, we wanted to make this, sort of a_ we wanted to use this space because we wanted to (really) interconnect the road, with the courtyard. so, by us, putting this, putting this um, this other face of our building on this side of the road, we sorta try to use this, try to try to, use um use this green space to our advantage. uh whereby it's it's very uh sparsely used right now at the moment, so i think by by doing that i guess, you start to, start to get a sense of that_ of the interaction that that could possibly happen, with that space, and for future development we'd be rooting for this area between us, our possible architecture building and the Music School. professors now can't complain that they're, away from students and, they'll have their own private spaces so they're, uh in the woods so to speak. in the woods, uh, very sorta transparent in this, direction. RESTRICTED i'm addressing more the, the street frontage of the building face, the long lawns, similar (to like)  RESTRICTED well when we, (very first drew this lawn,) not really i mean we tried to do entrance  RESTRICTED it's_ i would, go more with the entrance then however we needed suggestions, (xx,) to address, certain issues i think we'll need, you can keep the whole, keep the street, perfectly straight and have the building, (how it looks) on the street and have it faced on the street, i guess that's the way to uh, uh) cuz we don't need necessarily a right answer to it but we, i guess you know since we started to try to do that because the coffee area sort of leads right into this area right here, you can see RESTRICTED the coffee area so there RESTRICTED yeah the coffee shop area RESTRICTED RESTRICTED and it's along this edge RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED there's an entrance here and here and here RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED not in, not in (that side) i, i think there's, something also that uh Teresa's comment on that in terms of, what were you trying to accomplish, in getting rid of the suburban? and, my thinking is that you're trying to make it more urban, is that correct? and i think about uh, you know the idea of bringing the street to the building and that being the driving force in in making this more of an urban state. um, but i almost feel like you really need to, you know in order to accomplish that, it's somewhat set back as well wh- whereas to achieve something really urban you kind of need a continuation, of pedestrian traffic along that urban side. and what i'm s- i think the difficulty that i'm having with that is that, on what you would truly consider your urban side where the street is, you've placed the mechanical room. so you_ there's not even, really maybe the potential, for, if something was to happen on either side, for activity to happen along that urban side face, of the building. it's it's really kind of, conducive to, to highway, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED do you think (xx) RESTRICTED yeah i know with one building. but do you think if they described, if they started off, by saying, um that (the) one of the things that happens on North Campus is that buildings, uh fronts face the quad, and their backs face the street. and therefore when you're on the street you (have) sense that you're really not, part of the campus you're out of the action. and i, i think that one of the things they're trying to do is to break down uh begin to break down that (meaning.) so that all backs, don't face outwards toward the street and all fronts don't face inwards toward the quad. RESTRICTED RESTRICTED i i definitely i mean i can appreciate that notion too. i, i just feel like in order to really try to make that, a little bit more successful_ and i think you you started with it_ is to really allow it to have a front other than something that's nonusable i mean take the, take the classrooms or something like that and move your mechanicals in towards your open space where you have, parking and and things of that nature. um, it just it just really feels like, particularly when i look at the uh, at the view looking back towards the Media Union from Murfin, that entire s- street side i mean you're looking at you know louvers grilles and and things of that nature and, and i think that, that's starting to speak more about what you're talking about than than is actually the existing condition... not that_ i mean i, i_ you know not to get hung up on this issue either i, i think that it's very interesting, your exploration between the way the, classrooms relate to the studios. um, i i think that that's actually a very interesting notion that there's_ there could be some sense of integration there, where they feel like they're a lot more, in proximity to one another and i like the idea of the, of the bridging, as well and having that open space, uh between so that there is some sense of, of separation but yet, it has kind of a dialogue between it that i think is somewhat interesting too. could you talk a bit about about how you chose the form of your roof, and, how you chose to, butt up to, these circulation spaces on one side, and how you chose what (wide reach of space it could be,) and what form they should be? um, getting back to uh, oh i guess, we wanted_ (use it for the front of it save it for our lights,) we wanted to uh, we wanted to, um, cocoon the studio, (starting) with these fingers so, that's the reason, wh- that's the reason what we did and uh, uh certain value to,  meaning  and i think so yeah. we wanted these fingers to be more, the circulation to be more the dominant, feature in the building, and then after you get the recessed studio, and then after the in studio it, you know the circulation is actually reversed because it's_ the circulation is a lot more now than after your studio is open. and why did you choose the barrel vault? and and why did you choose to put the barrel vault in that direction rather than the other direction? the barrel, the barrel vaults followed the, the (xx) circulation which is (up in) here,   (which is) still a little technical i gave you a picture of mine in the studio. because i think i uh (had) to use our parti? yeah. we went into, actually, it doesn't really show in the model but  yeah. you see those, those were kinda, trying to simulate some of the (direct kinda weird) light is from the skylight as (disposed around) to that one. but then after um, bounced around then after it bounced off the roof and, sort of, just uh well you could look at the sounstitch roof and and look at how how how close do theirs need to be underneath the um, skylights to make that work and still, get the feeling you've got. i mean a lot of folks have no problem with it but you've, you didn't explain, you didn't, include it in your presentation, and yet when you look at the model it's the first thing that, you see. but if i'm, gonna talk i'm not gonna do it (i prefer extended.)  and i must say i do find the relationship of, of your site a bit too linear. (coordinate) with (pair) and for those going in a particular direction it's very, quite hard, to to to feel comfortable with, and in both of those top two and those there have to pose some of the problems particularly with the (billing) in. and it means that you_ whereas i felt as if if you had carried them before you moved the barrel vault out to the sides, you would then (xx) the studios even though, there was the walkway in between. you mean you're saying we should turn them the other way  (i know he,) i think that was an intent to purposely set our recesses (xx) back in   i think that's i mean that's been a recurring, topic of discussion, is what the relationship is between, the the form, of the studio space and the, and one of the things about carrying the the studi- the walls out, is that um this studio is not a freestanding building. and so, the junction conditions in each side are very different. and so when you tr- and so when you try to make the studio rooftop, it ends up being a nightmare. in terms of how it joins onto, the things around it. because the conditions are so different from side to side. but RESTRICTED we tried some, and maybe it's not successful of the sides out here, at left, perhaps um... had to mark on with,) interior sort of an exterior scene.  we ha- yeah RESTRICTED so, we have, on both sides (xx) and, a wide (alley) which (you know) creates, (i mean higher on one side.) so it's to add (a kind of depth to the scale) and kind of break up that long, uh... so but it also separates the building from the quality of the lawn yeah RESTRICTED sorry  yeah i think  if it was one or the other you'd have a better opportunity for that but because, you have, you have, the water element, and that exterior seating that kind of physically makes that, distance separation from the building, and then you have the the layer of skin, that gives you kind of that, uh separation in terms of being kind of like tactile or auditory, to the building, you're you're really quite separated in seeing it as a distance of an entire skin. rather than, even if you had this skin, you know somebody could approach the building and be in the same kind of pedestrian space, as them but, now you kind of, not allowed people to have either, of those. RESTRICTED the key word is experience Teresa could you (hear him) pronounce this become a bit (mums) like the enhancement RESTRICTED actually i want to make a comment just from, when was it Wednesday. i, i like where you've put your parking. sorry? i like where you've put your parking this is saying in contrast to the discussion on Wednesday. yeah. (why) in contrast to,   RESTRICTED we,  RESTRICTED but at least, well it's it's cheaper to put it underground it's and it's  (well let's just...) no it's  (no you thought it was sprinting) sprinting,  RESTRICTED you know what? having seen this (progress,) and i know, one of the problems you have is you have this big, (steel foot thing,) that you need, that you need. i think that you've, adjusted, and i think in the same way about a week ago when i saw it, it had those, (bulbs but) you couldn't read them as (bulbs) because it was hidden. you will if you now are going to adjust i think, you need to go further. okay i think at least you're, targeting... some useful, questions to get at. and i think that that's good so... don't think of yourself as dumb. even though today's the (big day.) you know what i mean i think you have these serious questions (to ask.) i_ it'd be interesting to ask Teresa, what RESTRICTED no (reall-) uh, what Ron's referring to is a week ago, the back wall of these, circulation spaces here and here was solid. mhm (okay) if you could imagine this as being, we had this  the thin edge of the hole you'd read it as a big huge heavy as if  but that in itself i mean you could say, you know it's an illusion. yeah   yeah. (no) before it was solid it was okay  i mean one one possible reason for the walls, you didn't say this, one one answer you could have given, is this thing, could compete formally with this, this thing. if it was read... (on that) side of the building now you're you're trying to get us to believe that it will be read on that side of the building. you're saying other than the professors? other than blocks of the (xx) once you make that huge gesture of going into the road to get to this other realm, this other wooded, agrarian log cabins    i mean maybe (there're places) for mas- for uh thesis statements or something. something just just to, to question, the nature of what that building could be on the other side. and then you never really, got at that. it's always been about the same. so i i wonder a (little bit about that.) (you) know what also, kind of strikes me interesting now is the idea that um, that your east facade i think would actually work, very well as a west facade. almost to the extent that, you're dealing with the vehicular scale, but you're revealing what's happening inside, you're providing somewhat, of a separation, between the vehicle and pedestrian, but you're giving, the v-... the idea of of vehicular traffic an idea of what's happening in the building you can see people moving through it, you can see the the revelation of that vault happening through the skin, but it gives you a very clear layer of definition, of that skin, that that kind of gives it some, some protection from that RESTRICTED yeah it it it yeah it's very much like that. RESTRICTED (you) might start to do it in, that little piece right there. that's about, (approximately,) eight ten feet. i think i just think there's something more to seeing it come all the way to the surface and having that ground plane where people move in in as well it it just for for some reason, whereas say the site in in town also has a kind of front and a back, but somehow the solutions are not so um, single-minded (on that one.) because it's an urban site people can know that they have to make a frontage on all faces, right right the difficulty we had with that, was, you know, entering the parking. i mean it, it automatically becomes, we assume that, there you come into the parking and it's all of a sudden the back. so, it was difficult for us to do, because  you know (a certain side) yeah    i'm sorry? how were you getting from the parking into the  we come   RESTRICTED corridors  so you  will you be  yeah   it's it's really from here. so i mean you're, you're going in through there and (then) you get into the parking. so, so as soon as you (up or) (but) i mean if you were visiting this school for the first time and you, and you arrived with a (valise,) how would you know where to go for anything...? RESTRICTED i think that even becomes more problematic if you walk the other way. because and then you've run into... you know a corridor with something on one side and a mechanical room on the other side and that could be, disorienting. i guess that's the difference between, getting there by car and getting there by foot (or isn't) the first time you're gonna come for an interview at this place with your parents? isn't that the experience you're gonna have? i was confused here. i didn't know where the front was and i mean i parked in the back but where was the front? it's st- it's a little, it's a little strange with those parking because i mean were they for, visitors as well or were they for, the   which is strange because what do you do w- with, you know, i mean it's pretty much you get around this campus by car. RESTRICTED but i guess, with our scheme we kind of took on the idea that it was really for, um s- students RESTRICTED Chris i'll tell you very quickly how we got to that. there were originally m- many more parking spaces in the building. and um... there was a, sense that it was probably, um really unrealistic to think of putting lots of parking up in the building, but the idea being that if each building had some parking incorporated within it, then there would be less need for, grade level, grade parking or parking structures. and so that you try to mitigate the problem of parking structures. although you can't possibly provide all the parking that's needed on campus under the building. economically. so that was the thinking and and it, quite frankly it was also, just a pedagogical tool, to, force, students to confront the difficulty of designing parking within a building. because it really governs what you can do above it and around it. and i think that my question's valid therefore. it's definitely i mean this scheme would definitely change if we had visitor parking. yeah yep  right it would be interesting to see what would happen if we had visitor parking (now) so where's the nearest parking lot then? whe- where would students    right. so that so that top right-hand corner entrance is an entran- is a major entrance for  so's the front  RESTRICTED (it's a whole other entrance) okay. we should probably, move on. thank you thank  RESTRICTED um can, can the next group get pinned out please? somebody can pin up um we have this layering going through. just to walk you through the plans, um, we have parking on our lower level that comes in from this direction. and then we have on the ground floor plane, this is, the main entrance from, either side, this would be more of an entrance for the campus, as well as this being the, primary, public grand entrance way. um, as you come in the entrance lobby, you have the exhibition space on this side, as well as the public auditorium space here. this whole zone vertically through all levels, is our public zone. um, as you progress through here we have high bay labs, workspaces, wood and metal shops and then building support at the very far end. as you go up a level again you have the public auditorium on the second level, you have the copy center, I-T-D, and then this public zone starts to stretch into the lobby sp- or the library space excuse me. and then beyond this we have administration offices. one thing that you notice here is when we start to break these pieces off, these four, towers house our faculty offices. all the faculty offices will have um, you know, windows, lighting, natural lighting. and then um, then (big luxury, luxury) a luxur- luxury luxury hotel this is um, as you proceed up again, you also have the public space here you have the cafe, and a student lounge. um, again you have another level of faculty offices, some um, more public offices like student-related activities like um... like A-I-A, those types of spaces. and then again the library which occupies the thr- these three floors, and then you have, student classrooms. um, the next level up again we have the public space here, um some more offices, the third level of faculty offices our library, more classrooms, and then on the top level you'll find the studio space occupying the, the complete right side, and then the tops of the towers become the crit spaces. um, with this um, looking at it structurally, we came up with a, a bay system, and one thing that's d- one thing that's separate from the bay system is the library. there's_ the library, is kind of unique and this is a perspective inside the library. um, it becomes, three central books, stacks, with this bridge in the center, that you see here, in this section, where this central part becomes, uh, a verondale truss that supports it, and so there are no, there's no columns in there or, or structural ties that go to the ceiling or wherever it's a free-floating bridge. and then, up t- from there you go up to the studio space, and you can see in that model, um, where the_ th- that's glued down, you have to spin it. um where the trusses, this is a a close-up detail of the trusses, become exposed. and where, where the trusses occur, the- the bottom truss, occurs on a column line but in th- where you'd think there would be a a a st- a steel beam or something in the roof there's nothing it's a, glazed skylight, to get light into the um, the studio spaces and those become, the circulation points into the studio there's also one that runs along the whole main, um, circulation zone. what we were trying to do with that is we were thinking of the, Architecture School not only as a, a building that teaches, or a not only a building that is used for teaching but it also teaches, as a building it's teaching, um, with our structure and then, one aspect which we um, have even developed a s- a second model is this wall right here, which we're proposing to be, um concrete encased with glass on two sides, and then also, in our investigation of materials is also another teaching tool, that we're using our building for. yeah and we take that into the facade designs where, in the facades, the main element that runs through it is the concrete. and the concrete ties, the three parts of the building, the, the entry part, the main, s- um the main core of the program and the towers. but each one's treated a little bit different where, this wall is, as in the example is, encased in glass. um, the main part of the building is concrete, and then at the sh- at the glazing systems, uh we're proposing a metal grating for, sun shading that you can see through, but when you're at an angle to it it looks solid. and s- and so you get this different reading depending on where you're standing. and then in the towers, at the office s- points where the windows are, is metal is uh wood infill panels. that's_ and they start to relate towards the, residential zone, of the site that's to the west. RESTRICTED oh this? RESTRICTED well, um, initially we were, looking at our building as, if we keep these existing buildings currently, that for a future proposal, you know if these buildings are no longer here the university owned them, the campus is gonna start to spread. and then tha- this gives us the opportunity to start to, you know rather than create a wall, we're starting to bring the scale down to relate to this but we're also allowing this, this possibility of expansion, of the university. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED no they are currently uh  um as far as the, the space between, um West Quad and our building, when we first started (w-) we were interested in creating um, wa- a public space, that starts to relate back to, the Diag and areas of the campus and with West Quad and South Quad, right here, tr- as a as a way to try to get, the freshmen and the sophomores that live here to use this space and even go into the school and use the library and the computers, uh we were trying to relate, our building back to this with a s- a f- a f- not a not a formal space but kind of an informal gathering-type space where, in the winter, the freshmen or whatever, go out and have snowball fights and it_ more of a, more of a s- a mixing-type space to bring peop- to bring people in. did you look at the um at the entrance to the lobby? you've got this very large enclosure outside the building and then inside you've got almost the well you've got a bigger area inside, for circulation and lobbies, at all levels. did you look at, trying to provide it by putting some of the staircases actually into your glass box? um  originally we actually had a  yeah  no it was further  it's not across the building i agree but on the other hand but but i mean, as far as the auditorium we're th- i mean i guess one idea we were thinking that the auditorium isn't just, a normal architecture auditorium and that the whole campus could use it and so this would be a space where you could hold receptions or whatever afterwards and RESTRICTED  out of that lobby (or anything) and in fact i did take on board the comments that we made earlier this week about at the ground level it worked pretty well having (a corridor long and off to one side) but higher up, there would be some advantages, right well,  i still think you are very high on circulation space RESTRICTED w- cuz the top level you have put the double corridors. the  you mean like this type of, yep yeah yeah, but then i question... well i know the comment earlier in the week that you're talking about was suggesting moving the offices over t- so they do get the windows, and moving the circulation so you've basic- to the center and cl- creating a double level corridor. um,  right well, RESTRICTED well i think that's how we were,  RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED well there is the_ i mean, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED   and RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED so what? do you think there should be a hard edge there? RESTRICTED we have a RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED Brian can you just tell me what's wrong with that truss? in the elevation?   what's wrong. we talked about  two things two things  what's this? what's wrong with the truss in the elevation?   yep   (pulleys) made out of triangles, in the elevation but couldn't it, be like a space frame, and there wouldn't be the need? you could carry it on the top cord here and have it in the bottom cord there, so we yeah but you still y- you  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED    not in that (different)  RESTRICTED    RESTRICTED it's not quite as easy to solve i guess RESTRICTED    RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED   yeah yeah  yes and then on the left-hand side RESTRICTED     oh and since i have  and what was wrong on the left-hand side? hm? and what was wrong on the left-hand side? what's wrong with what?   yes have you (been) listening um   the diagonal yeah  (this is the) (struts) right there needs to end   yeah it needs to have (up here) just always look at e- an e- an elevation of the truss should be made out of triangles, and always have the last diagonals into (each other) RESTRICTED maybe  you've got snow here  not well not at the moment not (well before i'm done, so) RESTRICTED um n- they're by hand. RESTRICTED well they're, they're generated on the computer and then  rendered them by hand so there's a very complicated process but it was ac- it sounds kind of like a (xx) simple thing RESTRICTED (xx) (complicated.) i don't know how long you've been going but i, i specifically wanna come back and, comment on this scheme cuz i saw it briefly the other day. i mean basically i really like it. ironically i think Al Talbert was actually right about some of the duplication okay (did you talk about corridors? um yeah the point i wanted to make but didn't wanna, rob time on the wager was that, um a linear, uh i uh_ the purity of the upper floor with all the studios under one roof i think is quite powerful. uh when you have a linear scheme, th- that's lon- that is that long and attenuated there's always the question about the end base. right   mhm  right  oh and yeah,  right (xx) o- one of the things that occurs to me in looking at the model, how it's made, is i'm wondering if the if somehow if the land contours, could have more influence (to) steps and may have even come into the auditorium. so that some of the contours of the site (tail hook) (coming (xx) yep these things might even be even, gone through gone through or something so that there's this, weaving (if i said) did you ever in your early partis have the, salt-like... office clusters as sort of outriggers on the other side of the building along the main street here? or were they always on the residential side? they'd always been on the,   has has anyone mentioned this uh how they're akin to the salt? well they yeah (they are) the um it's interesting though whether they in fact compete with the little houses, or whether they're or no  mhm um i... in some ways i'd almost like them, contrasting... with their, right  (they would.) in that green space, or if you  well no i th- i think you build them and that gives you permission to tear the houses down. (no that's c- w-) no, seriously see i  you've still got are there trees back in there in those  they're not eh- now yes. currently there are trees there and do you propose to keep those or eliminate 'em?   yeah. i i don't know those houses but i don't particularly like, all things being equal, tearing them down. in fact i would like to incorporate those and try to actually make them outposts of your building. (thesis base) um, thesis-based little idiosyncratic cute you know, places, as a further extension of this idea. i but i don't know know their quality    (i know i know.) you know and_ no they are. they're they've been lived in for students, wi- by students, for years, badly maintained, from the outside they looked, you know, shocking. so from the inside they're probably RESTRICTED diabolical, you know RESTRICTED on that front side? RESTRICTED i think that with the scale and the proximity, to the houses here though, unless you were to as you said incorporate, some type of so that the program that's involved here's relationship to the school you're really just kind of forecasting the inevitable of, of at some point it does come down RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED sure. which i would, i would think that, that has the possibility of of it being conducive to being incorporated into the into the building almost if you had architecture students who were living there you know it doesn't become almost as much of a problem as if it's kind of single-family housing. well there are there are in fact schools that use houses for thesis students and PhD students right that's (sunshine) just  yeah but it would rust and change over time is it like an egg crate? does it have to have yeah yeah  hm? does the main entrance lobby need some shade on it? well we've heard different ways of handling it, it's been proposed as an ideal inside space in which case oh how would  i mean  RESTRICTED thanks RESTRICTED thank you thanks so this is the North Campus... that's the bell tower, the Media Union... and i chose to locate, the new building on the slope, the north side of what i see could become, a larger public space for, North Campus. and... right now the way this works is it kind of bleeds out all over the place. there's nothing up here there's some trees on the hillside and so what i decided to do was to try and, not close it off but to extend it. and so this public space would grow, m- maybe towards the Music School there's water over here and, there's a nice forest so, part of the strategy would be to bring, that terrain in, smooth out the contour where the parking lot is, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED   okay. so, on that level, um... you can either stay as a public person and be part of the college, um or you can you can get up on a stair that's at either end and that's the ramping studio space. so the studio connects, the bottom part of the program to the top part of the program. RESTRICTED okay this RESTRICTED that's a tough, not exactly cuz that level's continuous it slopes down here and then it goes RESTRICTED yep RESTRICTED yep RESTRICTED uh b- only up to here. and then it turns into, a double-height space. at this end is... um, workshops research big void stuff, at this end each of these little knobs has, faculty, offices and on this perimeter are, classrooms and research, cubicles. so basically this is, this is the space of the building which is kind of a non- it's a space that's a nonspace, and all the enclosure inside, well the perimeter enclosure like the weather enclosure is, is glazed but all this stuff inside is meant to be, seen as temporary or movable or flexible or... so, in the plan in that middle space there's um, there's access to an auditorium and that auditorium, c- is sort of half in the ground and half out of the ground and, three-quarters of its shell protrudes into the gathering space, right there... but the_ it sort of the lowest point like at the bottom of the seats is is at the same level as the cafe. but you don't know that. it's separated in plan but that's why it's shown here. so, going up from RESTRICTED well i think it's, in, for me in thinking about how a person would understand the building it's it's through some kind of memory basically i mean i don't think it lends itself necessarily to program here program there and, a little diagram. so i think being in the_ coming up from the cafe let's say you were to come up from here, and then go down into the auditorium you would remember. so you would make the the public association. that was the idea anyways. um, so the studio's a ramp it's the part of the it's the part of the building that has, that connects the two sort of horizontal spaces so this is a flat plate and a flat plate but the studio, is like a parking... the RESTRICTED all the way around RESTRICTED well somebody asked the question the other day   is RESTRICTED yeah. you know roughly, equal to whatever you know thirteen sixteen students would be. these are thirty-foot bays so but i'm seeing this as totally flexible like, the question of what is a studio came up for me right away. i mean, for me the p- the possibility that the studio's not the end of the line. but it is the line was, was the point i mean so you'd you'd know what the students were doing, by walking past them. and RESTRICTED this is RESTRICTED but that looks flat  that part is flat but it you know it's part of the, spiraling connection. it's flat there, it's more right right except for this part which is atop of the auditorium which is sloped. so it's not a, it's not a continuously flat surface. see but it's you need to get up a little more speed of (when hit) so well i guess i'm not, i think one thing that's a little deceiving is is this stuff is super, gentle. it's not a, it's not a severe slope.  supposed to be a ramp. same sa- it's supposed to be  it is (it's this way) it's supposed to be the same just doesn't (look it) yeah. okay so RESTRICTED that's the (college.) RESTRICTED in this part of that upper, this RESTRICTED yeah, and then high bay at the end and back, here in the site why (is there) a cross-section? well that's what these are they're a little light, but you that's, um, right there is that is this hallway and that's one of these cut-ins, seen there. that's that hallway it's a double, this part of the faculty is double, layer of offices, and that kind of references the high bay space. so the delivery is here right? RESTRICTED yeah. except for, a l- it's partially sunk to kind of deal with the building next door that, it, it's four stories high but it's only got two rows of windows so it looks like, two stories. so that, that's the high bay space there, and it gets, some indirect light not, super-strong direct light, but there's a parking lot right here, on this side of the sheet, existing. so i figure that the trucks will come that way. um (xx) why? well... more than what i said previously or d- was it not, i'm not sure w- was it simply to take advantage of the circulation of the students coming from the dormitories to engineering? no. well... um, i put it up here for public, the large public space mhm right   yeah thank you i know i should understand this but i don't. if i'm coming from the parking in the dorms through the building i go down these steps. yep well originally there was no door, whatsoever, but, now there's doors. but they're meant to be able to,  so when the weather's nice they're they're sort of disappearing walls. yeah right. that's the idea. so one of one of the big, things here is that i, i s- i sense that although this space is nice cu- in its size and it it's, basically pretty functional, it's um, it's not flexible. and so i think as programs change and the studio grows it can shrink down the ramp or grow up the ramp and continue, and if there's... you know some faculty who wanna be close to the studio well you put 'em in the last knob. and if they wanna be closer to research you put 'em in the knob next to, and the idea of the courtyards is that it's a little more introspective space they look out on it they get some sunlight, right RESTRICTED yeah yeah sorry. i know that's a little, it's taken some knocks in the last couple days that's why you should always build two models. one for the first jury and one for the second jury.  which roofs can you get on? just this one. just that one. and underneath that roof is, what? it's it's the college. so there's the dean and all that sort of thing those types and that's, show me that in the plan again, is that the bottom plan? yeah that's here, that's the  i continue to be very worried about, uh light getting to the varied spaces because of your very deep plan, and whether, i mean you can sort of see it in the middle, the middle image in there, these thin slots i don't think are a substitute for windows. i, um   yeah, i think i- after actually we talked about this, yeah so that's where your column is (xx) and that lights the stair, and the slot here lights that space but what lights the offices to left these offices? well, i'm thinking that it's this. i mean there's a couple rooms here  gets past, where? wha- some are gonna come round here, so i  yeah but it's not gonna reach over to the, uh  RESTRICTED if they're the kinds of things like eh, RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED if if you say that (looking at it) (that's) (xx) okay, okay RESTRICTED so you think pulling it apart in this direction? RESTRICTED that's something that that, it's certainly, clear that this scheme touches on is that y- it's almost not a building, it's just a series of like strata of land that goes across and everything's clear. but it's almost as if, you could really begin to explore that, in in one of the ways she's talking about pulling pulling that away to bring the land through the middle. i'm also wondering, in terms of of_ you were conceding the idea of flexible spaces if you didn't even have the idea of floors or ceilings that also slid and moved so that in the hm   yeah i didn't think of that, oh which, which opening (xx?) well, he was talking about having having an opening here that light would come down and then possibly  he could have something that would slide to another area. or or the idea that the walls, why not all the walls be something that could in fact uh, you know if you staggered, the glass they could all slide in together and have large areas of outdoor space. so that it almost becomes mm RESTRICTED i guess there was one other_ about the horizontal, plates, there was one other, issue that i'd forgot to mention. that i was trying to get at which is in this building, um and in a lot of buildings, all the ar- all the architecture's basically in the ceiling. and the floor is kind of, the thing you beat on, mercilessly. and  without the what? without their s- their s- external brick skin. cuz it's i think Teresa was saying earlier that these buildings are all monsters with RESTRICTED RESTRICTED RESTRICTED yeah yeah you really want all those skins to slide past one another RESTRICTED yeah RESTRICTED  i mean it it it forces problems on you know then making the connection and and bridging and and things like that but, it it's definitely something, in terms of its content (that, that could) be really valid to explore. actually it's pretty interesting cuz one of the things about the section that i tried to get at was that it_ this void doesn't just drop straight in, but it kind of, jogs over and this vertical circulation does the same thing, and always sort of jogs over, but that, would be the exact same logic. even the the skin would be something that would kind of move over and is is there a swale like that or are you creating it entirely? it's there. it's in and there's a swale here too. it's pretty complicated i cut a i cut a bit out here to make it kind of a an outdoor space but, it's high, it's well, it's that's it, RESTRICTED (well,) d- you've said a number of things which have triggered things in my mind but i i can't quite put it together into a comment  yeah right it's not paper thin it's not paper thin yeah  RESTRICTED  yo- for example you're not gonna have one column. well, RESTRICTED yeah. this RESTRICTED no, RESTRICTED so you're saying  no. and then there's a second set of columns which are at a closer spacing and more random which fall where they need to. around the openings and, and things like that and that's that's the real, i think. now in terms of the thickness that's almost too many columns then isn't it? i don't know RESTRICTED yeah. RESTRICTED yeah. well that one's been fun. RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED okay which which is that um, there is always this problem of having to go down to go up. which is what you're asking all these people to do. yes and i c- i don't think that can be dismissed. people just don't want to do that. so i'm wondering... does it have to be that way? you know what i'm saying? i mean you're really saying, these people are gonna flow down that, that one floor, go through it and then come flow back up another floor. and they're really gonna resist doing that, really hard. so i'm wondering if, to c-... are your s- are your, are you have things happening at the right section? well i get, i don't know if i should let you go on well, no. i mean it's just a question i don't yeah, i mean i i did think about that. and i guess that was my way of trying to isolate the studio. i don't want random people  yeah yeah that's fair yeah RESTRICTED over, on the other side (is what you're saying.) RESTRICTED well i think if you RESTRICTED right i think if you were the kind of person who would be going directly to studio which would basically be us, then you should be able to do that but how do you, prevent the engineering student who wants to take a swipe at a zip disk? well well for, for example RESTRICTED  (is this) a phenomenon? so that was isn't that just one of those things though that yeah  RESTRICTED okay. i would definitely, i mean there's no reason, actually why this couldn't be five feet lower and just, slide right in there... RESTRICTED mhm and i hate to be an old fogey i really hate having to be the one to  okay RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  what do you think i'm gonna say?  oh well no i wasn't even gonna do that i was just gonna say, you really have to have to help us understand where the edges are you know what's glazed and what isn't RESTRICTED yeah i mean well you know, how does it really, work and what is this? i know light's gonna come down but there's a hell of a lot of different ways to do it. well i ended up, drawing a lot more than i, had time to model but that, the basic idea is that those, those light monitors are, boxes. and so they take up the curvature of the roof in their so- in  yeah  so you don't wanna do it  RESTRICTED   yeah  this is like (this like a) (xx) maybe you should comment about you have to show like bas- basic closure on the model RESTRICTED because it, will make a difference (in terms of the) perceptions. where is the enclosure?   mhm. yeah i know  the the the model is somewhat ephemeral to the point where we can be enamored with it,    that's totally fair it's difficult to well th- i made an attempt to draw what the enclosure is up here but that RESTRICTED  and it does show up and i know it's not totally clear w- what but  RESTRICTED yeah that's my com- that's my critique of the section they're um, they're photographs that i just haven't had time to develop. there's the bulk of it so, yeah. but it uh... i mean i do you (obviously) i guess yeah you do? yeah. it basically, at this point it, it doesn't exactly wrap it, but it kind of follows, well a good example is that there's a slot in here that's that's n- outside so this this n- the glazing here kind of follows in there and, what happens is there's a, there's a door there, see you can't see it, i know, no next chapter. okay thank you... mkay everybody ready? is this the last project? the last project. oh alright we really saw the idea as the studio as the heart of the Architecture School and the idea that this is where almost everything is created it's a construction base um it's where, ideas are formed and it's also um, really the intellectual hub of the Architecture School itself it's where most things happen most_ all hours of the day and really, for most architecture students the focus of their academic life um, as Tara said we were talking about the idea of a core with the studio in the center and that there would be this wrapper, and part of this choosing the, um downtown site was the idea that it was a somewhat more urban condition and we did take a, fairly um, i me- i don't want to use the word harsh but, defensive? RESTRICTED we are also building on a plinth. we are raising it up so that the building sits above, um we'll explain later this will be used as public space as cafe as an expansion of the cafe, out along the boulevard. um, starting with basic organization um, when we had the studio as the core we started to break away slowly at the idea of um, the site started to become involved and we really saw the studio, as the core and also the auditorium as the core of the public space and so that's what's represented by the two, Plexiblocks that this would b- this is the studio and this is the auditorium. this is a constant wrapper that um is part of the, mechanism that we used for the site and, part of the urban conditions and, the studio and the auditorium are treated in somewhat different manners due to their function, but in similar ideas and consideration to what happens to the wrapper, that can_ that holds all of the functions of the building. um, this we have a central, courtyard area external for public, domain it really serves as the entry sequence, you can see it in that perspective there... front door, if this is Madison coming straight through. this is one of the breaks of the arm you basically slowly this, this site slopes down about sixteen feet from the back corner down to the bottom of the plinth, so you would walk up a slow slight flight of steps or you would wal- use the um handicap ramp, and you'd be coming to the central, atrium. and in the central atrium space before you enter the building it's about the idea of RESTRICTED courtyard.   um, being that we, we blocked off the street we used that as our major entrance into the building, so as you come through up, you enter, right at the knuckle where there's a central stair and you_ and we broke down the program into basically public and private functions. where cafe exhibition, and auditorium are on this end, the more public functions and then all the classrooms studios at the center, offices things that have more to do with the private functions of, the building, are to the other direction. um, but you always maintain this visual contact back and forth the courtyard, through, the glazed exterior. you know back into the studio it's always, you know something you have to acknowledge. as you move through the building, um we wanted to keep the studio as its own jeweled element but, still have connections through it, so, you don't walk through it really but you sort of pass, through it over a catwalk and there are visual, well there are actually um... little shafts through the building so you walk down a catwalk like penetrating the studio and you can always penetrate through it. so you, you're always mixing with it. and the way that the program is broken down, um with the classrooms and the offices they all, sort of open out into this courtyard. the circulation, goes all the way around and then through. so you're always acknowledging, the studio and the happenings of the studio, the presence of the Architecture School. um to complement the idea of the courtyard we also have an internal void um, that is on the other side of the studio that allows for light in the inner core of the building, a- (this one) it's interior or it's exterior?   inside RESTRICTED the plinth extent.  the roof is unresolved. it's gonna be like, a skyline. it'll work, if that's the intended line the intended line is something like this we have ideas of the fact that it would float from either side so that it wouldn't be a v- so it wouldn't be a harsh visual connection, and there's also the idea that if it was, coming from either side that there would be some venting to allow for cross-ventilation across the studios, as for um, open-air systems but, it is not a resolved element. so basically it's open the studio is open to all sides and then, classrooms and such get closed off around it. so it becomes this open core. the entire way through. in terms of organizational structure um, the, eastern wing is primarily offices all of our offices have opening windows and have natural daylight. um, on the back core against the parking garage it's mainly um services that do not need as much natural lights things like laboratories shops, the dark room, and there's also some oa- classrooms more formally yeah it's more formal um, basically, the actual volume of the studio would puncture through, the hard edge and be exposed to the street, the idea that there would be, a couple studios and in the center would be crit spaces, um the catwalks get to look down over these crit spaces so you have visual interaction from different levels, it's, the whole m- the whole part the whole scheme about this jewel is that you you see it in many different lights it's not only, from coming into studio coming up the stairs to go work it's going t- if you're going to a crit if you're going to see a lecture you're always constantly interacting  if you're leaving your office?   go out of the building you might take the catwalk across the studio then go down rather than going all the way around RESTRICTED this is cut... right across the center so, looking down? yeah yeah so,   yeah it's a little bit delicate when you have a bilateral symmetry in your structural system if you don't have, the other half. it doesn't always be, structurally stable. and do you have a section that corresponds with that? yeah... well, looking the other direction looking the other direction right right  so you didn't build, th- this the roof. is that what's happening? yeah there would be  okay. well did you not build it to communicate something or you didn't know how? the idea that this punctures through there's also, some unresolved, trying to figure_ it works, when you just punch it through, it works, i mean why doesn't this roof just go through? that does actually. it does. but that_ this has to sneak underneath it it's no... this dominates. oh i see what you're saying yeah. this this bar goes like this and then it    (it's the drain goes in) RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED the idea about the um exhibition is that you cou- you can also close it off at night and still get, punctured views into it so you can see into it if you're going to an evening lecture or if it's,  RESTRICTED mhm yeah. that's more student, RESTRICTED and, wh- uh why are these bits of wall here and here, um without holes so is that deliberate? yeah that's basically where the mechanical risers and the the toilet facilities are. and where, rooms also that don't need natural light. on the sides back here. and of course on either side of the fire escapes as well. we wanted to try to maintain, as strong a facade on this side as possible right.  no. but, no. RESTRICTED   this is just detail but it_ this in fact this wall is contiguous with this plane right there's not a walkway there is there? no. right no no it isn't, not ye- can it be moved so you can make it that way or is that st- glued...? oh it's glued okay. it would essentially be this wall would pen- go all the way down, RESTRICTED   so you only get onto it from the higher level   we wanna try to hold that corner as much as possible being that it is sort of, the gateway to campus, it's, very much an edge that we wanted to, define but you still have a sidewalk  yeah the way wh- it's really  because, if it were, because this wall, this wall should go right down to the street. and rather than this jutting out and then it,  same material   yeah. well  RESTRICTED  this yeah RESTRICTED  you you you've really negatively biased, the reading of this by doing that RESTRICTED cuz that works, that makes a much richer, end of the sense about the wall in sort of, yeah RESTRICTED     because in here there's also an idea about the fenestration which is many-layered, sorry the the facade, you might want to talk about that but, then at this end those layers kind of come apart. the wall is a th- and that's before you, photograph this for your portfolio change this it will get changed yes. i i i'm much more convinced in terms of that obviously, you know being a part of the building, um in that working but it's still_ maybe it's because since i've, moved to this state and seen the Ren-Cen that it just drives me crazy to have a plinth next to something that's pedestrian at that type of scale, um, but i just think of the height of, mhm    RESTRICTED  i guess then i'm even thinking what's the relationship the, to that exterior caf- cafe area. mhm  i, i suppose that's   would  mhm yeah      well the- right. well i think on the east side of that you could be ramping up on to it.    that would diminish the scaling and give you, hope. Leah did it Leah tried a couple of different entries to it and, i think we ended up resulting that the best way that we knew to hold the corner, was to leave it as the one entry because the other ways was really seeming to disintegrate and not taking as strong of a stance. and we decided we would take a strong stance.  RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED yeah but you could you couldn't you've got um um a a glazed-in foyer to the auditorium into that space could you? cuz that could be quite nice, nice. (xx) (huge) so you're saying that the, entrance being here, (being) it back here? yeah um- i know it means rearranging, but RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  yeah RESTRICTED   well you could still enter   but in fact it's (confusing because) you don't have a fi- you don't have a double-edged structure around no just hold still just professors. well i must say i've been waiting for the last month to see how much you were gonna do here.  yeah  yeah   RESTRICTED we had thought about RESTRICTED RESTRICTED classro- RESTRICTED path RESTRICTED which part? this part? RESTRICTED RESTRICTED  or between the studio floors i don't RESTRICTED   which wa- this way?  yeah. yeah. and then  this just seems like   yeah      it's actually quite difficult because you do want that roof to predominate, yeah mhm it detracts   it's a real difficult i don't see a solution actually. we were hoping that it could well i know tha- i me- i think it's a_ i think you've done a great job at this scheme i think it's a great scheme in many ways, but i think it's a fatal kind of flaw. i mean in some ways i just don't know what to do there. i really don't. because, the autonomy of the thing is going to be compromised somehow. and i- and i don't know what to do.   that's interesting.   (this one) that's a good idea.      that's    and it's north light anyway so, you know you may wa- it doesn't really matter  right. so then this is just the top level of of_ the top level's here the slightly different relationship this is more interconnected, mhm are there operable louvers in the south side is that what's happening? um, the intent_ we were a little bit indecisive between operable louvers and um something that would_ some type of venting from underneath, um we'd have to have,  oh sorry. venting is,   and they're inside or outside? they are   um, for the idea that we could ha- bring air up through and it could be an air seal and start to go for, um, cross-ventilation out, through the skylight. but it's also because you want to see this smooth skin    yeah RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED  they wanted to get light RESTRICTED  so it's a dilemma. i mean i know why you did it it makes sense to me on some levels but,  RESTRICTED   RESTRICTED  RESTRICTED RESTRICTED can i can i fo- add on to that? another way of looking at it was was there a flaw in this? that because, at bottom level you couldn't get the light into it and maybe you have to reexamine, it on the basic level, ah yeah mhm  when could you do these? we did them after midterm crit is there  the idea had always been there the idea RESTRICTED what i_ i must say i i can't see the_ having the void on the north side of the studio is a fatal flaw. i really don't see that. i can see that there are difficulties in resolving it but there are there are voids all the way around the studio. mhm RESTRICTED RESTRICTED 	1
LES385SU007.json	mod three forty-four. and then two-to-the-one-seventy is congruent to one mod three forty-one, just (xx) that it two-to-the-three-forty is congruent to one mod three forty-one. so how can you use this to, to prove that three forty-one is composite but how can you use it to, to actually factor the number three forty-one? any volun- any volunteers? okay. anyone get this problem? i can tell you uh how how y- how we know it's composite. so how do you know it's composite? well there's a theorem that says um, that, M is, uh given M prime, yeah X-squared is congruent to uh... one. X-squared is congruent to one mod, M, uh, if and only if X is cong- X equals, or X is congruent to plus or minus one... mod M. yes so, if M is a prime number, then... thirty-two squared cannot be congruent to one mod M. and, now wh- what was the proof of this? and and this was one of the homework problems. of course you get that M divides X-squared minus one, which is X minus one times X plus one... so if M is prime then M, must divide either X minus one or X plus one. (then two to th-) two-to-the-one-seventieth is not, congruent to one mod thir- three forty-one...? it is. oh   yeah. but t- what's two-to-the-one-seventy? it's two-to-the-eighty-five-to-the-square. right.  okay cuz i oops, cuz, alright cuz it, couldn't you use that same, theorem um, since we were given that two-to-the-three-fortieth is congruent to one mod three forty-one?  no i okay i i'm sorry i just i used, the same theorem that you used to disprove it, t- um, from what i thought was to prove it that it was a S-P-S-P...       oops. i... yeah cuz yeah but, yeah. so then, then the test is  you know that the, the theorem that uh, the G-C-D between X minus one and M,  yeah thirty-two plus one and thirty-two minus one? yeah, it's thirty-two plus one... and thirty-two, minus one. so we get thirty-three times thirty-one, and three forty-one divides that... so what are the, possible factors of three forty-one? what was it (xx) three eleven and thirty-one yeah. and, what's the actual factorization? (two) eleven eleven and thirty-one, it's not divisible by three why do you have the three there? hm? (xx) oh, well it, it (does show) yeah what you get here is not, so, you can put, you can you can conclude that the G-C-D of thirty-one and M is less than M and greater than one, and the G-C-D of thirty-three and M, is less than one and, greater than M if you wanna use if you wanna use that homework problem so if you don't wanna, if you don't actually wanna, make this computation you can just quote the homework problem, that's another way of getting the factors... uh first you get that the G- the G-C-D of thirty-one, and three forty-one... and then you get the G-C-D of thirty-three and three forty-one. now, what we're gonna do today is, is what we started last time, um, and that's uh, the multiplicative structure,  one more thanks so let's start with the first one, if uh, the powers of two mod eleven, um, what's the, what's the first, what's the first I such that two-to-the-I, is congruent to one modulo eleven? well you have to go all the way up to ten, we know by Euler's theorem that ten will work, um well actually, that's, you know Fermat's theorem. uh,   okay. um, what's the order of four? it's still five. what's the order of five? five. what's the order of six? ten. uh, what's the order of seven?   ten. the order of eight? it's ten. the order of nine? five?   how can you tell that without, ever looking at this table, that the order of ten is two? mod eleven. hm? uh, the idea is that ten is congruent to negative one, of course negative one, to-the-square, is one, so... the order of ten, must be, two... so what are the possible orders? the, i didn't list, the number one, what's the order of the number one? one one one that's the only thing that's the only number, whose order is one, because the only number raised to the first power, that will give you one, is the number one. what are, if M is a prime number, what are the numbers of order two? oh M minus one? M minus one. M minus one is M minus one is always a number of order two, uh, is there any other number, of order two mod a- mod a prime? one, one will be won't it? one has order one oh (xx) M is prime, right? if M is prime, there (isn't) why? because, because of because of (that.) if the order, of of of the number is, two, then that number satisfies the equation X-squared is congruent to one, modulo M. if M is a prime, we have only two solutions, plus one, which has order one, and minus one, which has order, two... okay so if we, if we start to fill out this, list, the possible orders are, one, and there is only one, number of order one. then there's two, is a possible order, and the multiplicity's still one, what are the other possible orders, that show up? five five five and ten. how many, numbers, are there with order five? four okay. how many numbers... of order ten? four alright so let's let's start to look for some factors. so what are the possible orders? one two, five and ten. uh, what does this suggest? (that) all numbers relatively prime to one what was that? all numbers relatively prime to one, well, that's a- one's prime so, factors of Todd? factors of? N minus one? factors of N minus one. factors of order factors of? of phi of M why phi of M? i don't know i- you know just thinking more (xx) (more generally) factors of phi of M   okay so i- if this data will will will, not be enough to come up with, with with with the right answer, for sure but we can j- we can we just try to make some conjectures and one conjecture was that, the order... the possible orders that appear, all divide M minus one. yeah...  shouldn't you just? well if M isn't prime then can't you have some numbers for which no order exists, like uh two and four, uh (i mean like there, or, ) oh w- the order, always exists because i'm making the assumption that A is relatively prime to M. other other, (course,) i i'd be in trouble, Luke? couldn't we just change M minus one to phi of M? uh, Richie? (xx) let N be the factors of M... oh  like,  okay so, the product of phi minus one, as phi divides, M this, these are these are all possible, uh, conjectures, now, let's just... one one what's the order of one? one one, and it divides two minus one, so...   two one one and two. one has order, one, and two has? two order two, because, two is congruent to negative one... one and three one and three one and two one and two, so phi of M is two phi of four is two... um two two two. what's the order of five? two three it's still two. and what's the order of seven? just two two (xx) just two because it's negative one. so here, all the orders five. so it's not a primitive element. what was the order of eight? ten so it's, a primitive element. what's the order of five? five it's not a primitive element. the order of, ten? ten it's not a primitive element. the order of nine? five. the order of seven? ten. the order of, uh... three? five. five. and the order of six? ten. ten... so, two, eight, seven, and six, are the primitive elements. um, i, i_ my claim is, that, you could figure this one out from the indices. so two, is two raised to the first power, eight is two raised to the third power, seven is two raised to the seventh power, and six, is two raised to the ninth power. so from the indices, um, what are those indices that that enter here? they're the numbers that are relatively prime, (to ten.) yes, so, one, three, seven, and nine, these are the numbers yes? yes, it's congruent to two squared. five. six. five five. why should five be congruent to a square? cuz four is even. yeah. so this is two-to-the-fourth power, which is two squared, squared, so this is a square, same goes for six, eight, uh, so, what corresponds to them is nine and three. so six is an even power, eight is an even power... uh, nine is a square, and three is a square, and of course one is a square. now what about the, the odd exponents, of can two be a square? cuz it's... (beyond two) if_ if A was the square root of two, then its order would be, twice that of two? yeah if it_ what would be the order of, of, let's say two is the square of something, A. what would, the order of A be? twenty. twenty. can the order of A, can any number can any number have, an order which is twenty, mod eleven? no the order must be less than or equal to ten, by Fermat's theorem. so two cannot be, two cannot be a square. now how can you tell from two not being a square, that you can cross out all the odd exponents...? so how can you know that, eight cannot be a square then? i have a question about the,  yes. um, if we're saying if the order of A is phi of M, so then on your example mod eleven, yeah uh,   okay, the order, of something, is the smallest positive power,  right. and, so the primitive elements six. and six. but if you well, i didn't use i didn't use, i didn't use the, the tables, but you could use the tables i mean you listed all the orders, you can just check that these are the primitive elements. and what i claimed is, that... right. but the, the, those are the indices. so the point is it's kind of li- like a logarithm, and we're gonna get back to this uh subject next time, this is called a discrete logarithm. so, instead of working with the actual numbers, i can go, uh, and work, with the indices. it's just like, the indices tell me, what number i have to use, what, i have to raise two-to-the-third power, to get eight. i have to raise two, to-the, ninth power to get six. it's kind of like a logarithm... and, well i'm gonna explain it, next time, but, but when you work with the indices, with the indices, you have to, (b-) what impor- what's important is, how do you, relate to the number ten which was phi of eleven. right. 	1
LES565MX152.json	(appears) to be registered uh, and although, in this class every year between about the first and the third class we lose a few people um, that's, it's it's it actually turns out to be much better, to lose people early than late uh, because, as you probably know, uh o- over at I-S-R, if you wait a while you pay a lot more so um um, basically this is a s- class that requires, a fair amount of prior knowledge and skill and some, commitment and motivation to do work and so, people who don't have all that combination, sometimes drop away and, it's better for them. um, you might notice, and certainly is apparent to us that, during about the first, week maybe ten days of this class the, the d- the differences between you, in your, skills and familiarity with S-P-S-S and, how well you can use UNIX and um, for quite a lot of people finding the right building at the right time is a problem at first, those, those differences seem very diverse at the beginning, but i can guarantee by a week from now w- there won't be a dime's worth of difference between you, in that because we move so fast and so, i just if you're feeling uncertain about things, you'll get certain with them really quite quickly. um, i want to encourage you again to stop and ask whenever, you don't understand, or, need some clarification or whatever of anything i'm saying or, this goes for David and Katy also, uh because, it's very hard to know what you don't get, unless you ask us, so i really encourage you to do that. um, in terms of, uh talking about things that are in the book um, and i will start doing that today, i i w- i'm going to try as much as i can to stick with the sort of, the terminology and the, use of of uh notation, i'm gonna try and do it just almost, it's been useful for me to move closer to what's in the book because it's useful, for all of you who have that to fall back on. so in fact once in a while if i slip or the notation that i've used in, either the handouts or something i write on the board is different than what you've seen in the book, please stop me and, th- we'll make sure because, some of it's a little... it's it's a little, it's it's quite precise. um, since the next time you come to the lecture, uh you will actually be bringing your first assignment, i thought maybe it would s- be worthwhile to spend a little bit of time, talking about, the assignment today because there're some, th- there're some sort of general things about the assignment so if you happen to have your, um, syllabus with you i'm, talking a- i'm looking at the paragraph that's on page eight that describes the assignment. here's what we'd like you to do. um, and, this, shows how much we're expecting, you to learn and do between now, and a few days from now, but i think, by the time you actually, get to writing this up, y- y- th- mostly people don't really have any trouble, once they get over the hump. you need to go into the codebook, for our E-C-L-S data and e- toward the end of today's class i'll talk a little bit more about, the data. um, and you need to select, a simple multi-level question. that can be addressed with these data. so that means you need to select, a dependent variable, uh, and you need to select a few child-level variables, and a few school-level variables. um... i would encourage you not to select a huge number of these uh basically, one of the, it will seem the first time or two, that you do this, creating a sufficient statistics matrix writing out the data etcetera getting ready to, run an H-L-M will see so c- seem so complicated, that, in a sense what you'll be thinking of doing is, well why don't i just do this once? and then i can use this one, what we call, S-S-M sufficient statistics matrix, more than once and certainly that's, a possibility. however i'll just tell you right now you will be making hundreds of these. so, there's no reason to try and pack everything you ever thought of you might wanna ask in this first one so i would suggest, no more than maybe, three or four child-level variables and, three to four, uh school-level variables. and the reason_ i mean in fact to do your first assignment you don't really even need these, all you really need is a dependent variable_ i want you to get used to thinking about, variables at one level variables at another, and a kind of a question that you could be addressing with that, with those so that that's the purpose of this. if you happen to create a sufficient statistics matrix, with variables, and everything's perfect then you can use it thereafter, chances are you'll be wanting to do it again. um, um so, that's the first step. you're a- well there's a lotta steps aren't there? choose a question. next step choose some variables to address that question. and you need variables at two levels the, child level the individual level, and the group level or the school level. so you need, you need variables from both of those s- systems files that are listed in the codebook. and on Friday you will learn how to, d- do this. um, the next thing you will be doing is computing the intraclass correlation for your outcome and we talked about that the other day. that's the proportion of variance, sys- that lies systematically between schools, on this outcome. uh, you'll also get an estimate, of the H-L-M, uh version of reliability on this outcome and we'll talk a little bit more about, how that type of, reliability varies from the kind that you may be familiar with, uh Cronbach's Alpha for the moment just think of them generally as the same they're an indicator of, how good a measure is the outcome variable for being able to do the kind of thing you want. um, so that's the task. now, how o- how will you present the task? well, when you write up your paper, you'll want to lay out your research question, and you may even want a few sentences in fact it would be a good idea to have a few sentences about why you think that's a good question and and the multi-level nature of the question i kinda wanna see your thinking and your writing. in fact i wanna see your thinking and your writing in every paper, not just your computing. alright then you're gonna do your analysis be sure that you include with your paper, um, all of your S-P-S-S output that you need to do this or, if you're using SAS SAS. the command file for writing out the data, the log file for the H-L-M run just so we have a record, of everything you've done. um, then you'll wanna write something, about what you've learned, uh from what you've done about the, the intraclass correlation, and the the degree of promise this has for, uh for future analyses. now, i don't have any problem with your doing this six or seven times till you get a good one, but i also don't have any problem just choosing one doing it, and learning from what you've gotten. i mean the first st- dependent variable you choose, may be one that really doesn't have a lot of promise but you've learned a lot by doing that so, really the purpose of this explan- of of this, first exercise is the, the first step in any H-L-M is this step, but i wanna, make sure, that, y- that you all have some sense of conceptualizing the multi-level question and dealing with the data and writing it up. so, when you do this, um, you'll wanna have a cover page that has all the things that would go on a cover page, uh, i i don't care, quite, how you include the output uh a lot of people, actually, put it into a text file cut and paste and get it into their fi- that's fine, if you wanna just, literally cut and paste and stick it on a piece of paper, that's okay too. anything else David or Katy that i should say about this assignment? i don't wanna get people too hyped up before they even know what they're doing but i also wanna s- i i wanna say that i do have some expectations for the form, of your presentation and your ability to write about what you've done. some people who've come to this class say, oh well wait a minute when we're taking statistics classes all we wanna do is show you that we know how to do things. not in any class that i ever teach. the writing it up is important. though this isn't really_ the write up here is much less, than we'll expect in future papers, however, i wanna see that you can wrap words around the ideas that you're doing.  the only thing is, r- remind us if tomorrow we forget to show you how to edit output, so that it will save you pages. so that  yeah. be sh-  (xx) (xx) one other question to uh, to you uh because of this assignment. mhm   yeah i just wanted to say that those categories are arbitrary and, um, we just put them there after, we did the codebook so that it would be easier for you to find particular variables, that y- you're interested in demographics or another thing. so, they're totally arbitrary and, you don't have to,    um, in that larger file are there, variables above the school level? uhuh. mhm. cuz i didn't find any (in the) well  uh uh (okay)  Maria, is there  no, this isn't a LISREL-type of program. i mean i suppose one could always, turn them around and_ well no you really couldn't. i mean as a matter of fact, actually, we recently did a study using these E-C-L-S data where we were extremely interested, to know, which kinds of kids go to which kinds of schools and, we conceptualized schools, along i think fifteen fourteen to fifteen different dimensions in terms of, school quality. in terms of teacher_ how well educated the teacher is exper- uh experience of the teacher the condition of the neighborhood i mean we wa- we had a long list. alright. that would essentially ass- assume that you've this, these school-level outcomes, and these individual-level predictors. th- i think that's what you're kind of asking. there's no H-L-M that could be done that way and in fact i would be happy to share that paper with you and how we did it, uh, nobody's ever seemed to have objected but, i've done about three papers of this type and it just gives me a lotta trouble each way um, but, i don't know, there isn't, no. it's a good question though. uh as i mentioned the other day and these people certainly support this, the f- research has generally shown, very modest school effects. particularly pre-H-L-M, research. and most of the one_ uh most of the research that has shown school effects, way back before H-L-M, really focused on, um... school composition the kinds of the_ the aggregate characteristics of students who go there. for instance the average S-E-S at the school, or, the racial composition of the school, or uh, the average ability level of st- of children as they come into school now, we're in a particularly good situation to look at, the average ability, of the kids in the school here because we have measures of cognitive performance, as kids enter kindergarten. now at most public schools in the United States kindergarten is the first grade that we offer. and in fact, the structure, of education in the United States this is the first time that every p- child has access to free public education. we do offer some um um, publicly supported preschool programs, but in the United States those publicly supported preschool programs, are reserved for the poor children. and they're not universally available. Head Start's not available to everybody, it's only available to people with quite low income, and the, there are state, supported uh preschool programs as well, but these are restricted to poor kids as well. so this is the first place, that we have universal public education offered to everybody. um, in this article they've called, for more attention to what they call the social organization of schools and, this is a phrase that f- flows off my lips because it's the kind of thing i w- w- would_ w- i think about all the time. to to, kinda clarify that a little bit, this m- might be, a- looking at questions like which children get which services inside the school? who has access to what? uh, and something that might have to do with the distribution of resources in fact, the word distribution is extremely important here. and they call attention to the fact that school attributes are more than just central tendencies meaning aggregate characteristics of individuals, uh they they think it's important, that school variables, in_ when you're doing a school effects analysis are measured close to where, the instruction actually occurs. probably, what's driving Klaus's thinking for he wants more variables. and that's fine i think that's great. uh it's really quite wonderful to recognize that so Ypsilanti Ypsilanti, just keep going, Taylor Romulus, uh etcetera. then you go north from Detroit, um, just one question sure i got that so far there's only one more coefficient this this thing that's always point-nine-nine-something. i didn't quite get what  no uh the uh,    four alright. now, i am gonna write this again on the board where the uh, regression line cuts the uh, one of the  yeah cuts what? (the y-axis) the axis can s- someone expand on that? the intercept is the value of Y when X is zero. just, what was your measure of social class, in this? well uh the standard measure of social class it's the same one that you have on this file uh includes, three common things. i mean i d- i don't want this to, become too much of a sociology class but it's certainly is important in education to know these things. and you could probably do this better than me. um family income, parents' education, and parents' occupation. so they took fam- the parents report a family income, and they took the uh education of each parent, took it into account, but only took one if it was a single parent family and they took the p- the the the educational uh the occupational prestige of the work of each parent if they were two or only one and they created this social class measure. on the file that you have, social class i- the average is zero so it's already, not centered in each school but it's centered on the population the average is zero so zero is a middle class kid, and and, it's a it's what we call a Z-square variable. mean of zero, and a standard deviation of one. i didn't actually check to see if_ we didn't re-Z-score those did we? uh,  just took from the whole   but it pret- it should be close. but we dropped a few crowded schools. so, anyway, it should be close. alright. let's talk some statistics here for a minute  w- let's not worry about that now but  Maria i think that it's gamma-one-zero. under beta-one-J equals, oh yeah yeah yes cuz it's the intercept. it's_ yes y- otherwise the_ we got two of 'em thanks a lot David. now let's just go through that again okay? you can stare it on your paper you can stare at it o- at it, hm. gamma-zero-zero, is the average achievement, across all schools for public schools. now remember, that we've also taken into account the social class of the child. that's how we got these. so you really can't assume, if it's, you really can't assume hetero- hetera- (xx) that_  okay  Maria?   oh no no i think  is is the the dependent variable always at the lower level? or,  and it has to be otherwise the whole machinery   but does the program not work if you wanna, do bottom-up instead of  okay. but does the,    the lowest level always has to be an individual? no okay in that   okay   nested in   okay so you can use an aggregate as, as the dependent variable? mhm, okay alright distribution yeah   oh this is not gamma i'm sorry.  due to funding issues half-day. right now, that's Ann Arbor thinking about what their priorities are. this is the s- school district one of the highest per-pupil expenditures in the state but they still say they don't have enough money, for full_ half_ for full-day kindergarten, and the reason is and this is not unusual at all, is they don't really think it's that important. if they did they'd have it. so, it's very_ it's been a big controversy across the country full-day and half-day. there're a few states where the whole state_ like Nebraska's one where the whole state is, full-day kindergarten. um, there're some that's school district by school district there's some where it's all half-day. and actually one of the things you have, on your file that you might be interested in is, you h- i hope we have this on the file, uh, uh, what region of the country the school is in. uh uh that_ yeah. that th- th- there's actually considerable regional differences in kindergarten which i had_ i've always ignored region as_ but this is really, sort of important. okay. now d- you're gonna hafta know something about this pretty soon, uh and th- this i'm talking about now is what about missing data? now this is not a course about missing data and don't i wish that everyone had already taken a course about how to deal with missing data but usually, nobody's even thought about it much. so, let's talk about it for a minute. um, well the first thing to say, and this is an important thing, to say cuz you're gonna confront it by the time you do your first analysis is that H-L-M allows no missing data at the school level. now what that means is if a variable that you choose to describe schools is missing on a school, that school and all the kids in it will be completely eliminated from your analysis. so, is that okay? generally H-L-M is the kind of program where you don't wanna lose any data at any time because you need all the data you can get. secondly, if you were to lose schools and, the students in them, i mean what we have here is a nice random sample of U-S schools and kids, and once some of them go away i can guarantee you, that when you lose schools, due to missing data, it doesn't happen randomly. so, what we often do and Katy and David will be showing you this ever so soon, is we d- we plug in values on variables that we care about for schools that don't have data on those. we impute, values for that. and i- i'd prefer, that you don't just impute the grand mean because if it's a Catholic school the grand mean is not really relevant etcetera so sometimes y- you need to get a little bit of information and some time we'll learn to do this. but it really is, generally, not okay to lose schools. so we don't wanna do that. luckily, at the, within-school level, l- level one, you can select either pair-wise or list-wise deletion. so, we prefer pair-wise deletion, because y- then you don't lose everybody uh, that's missing on those data uh, so, that g- generally th- there there's kind of a like a rule here. the rule is don't lose data. do whatever you can to lose it so, i suggest pair-wise deletion of missing data within schools, you can't select pair-wise deletion of missing data between schools so you hafta do something different about that. now the very first time you do this i suppose it doesn't make a lotta difference if you lose a lotta schools, but you better pay attention, from the very first time you do your first run to, your overall sample sizes and what you've got and what your analysis is compared to what you started with. and what you started with are the Ns that are in that codebook. so N equals two hundred for schools and N equals three-three-oh-nine for students so, keep that in mind as you go through and when you lose a lotta schools, pay attention. cuz every time you lose a school you lose every kid in it. um, now there's a th- there's a case occasionally, when you might lose, some schools, and it's probably appropriate to do_ to to to lose them. and i'm i'm kind of leaping ahead a little bit but i i wanna make sure that, you at least begin to think about missing data and what happens here and y- you know that it isn't like, the program is not out to get you here it's really h- how you deal with the data, and the program that you're dealing with. uh if you are interested in, let's say, did i_ is this still (on here?) how would you filter the schools out if you want some of these schools out? well there's select-if, you know if_ S-P-S-S has select-if and you filter 'em out any time you want. y- you don't wanna do too much filtering here because, the S-P-S_ i mean because H-L-M is a data-hungry. and so it wants lotsa kids and it wants lotsa schools. so, i mean if you're only interested in public schools for example they've_ we got lotsa s- lots of public schools. if you were only interested in doing an analysis on Catholic schools i think you got a problem cuz we don't really have that many. so, that select-if, i mean, th- th- i i can guarantee you if some of you haven't been using S-P-S-S, or SAS for a while, uh, you're gonna get, you're gonna get limbered up real fast because, any time you wanna create a composite variable any time you wanna do any kinda data manipulation whatsoever, before you read the data into H-L-M, then you're gonna need to get S-P-S-S for that you're also gonna need S-P-S-S for the_ just reading 'em in. okay. i think you're, brain-weary here today. Maria i, um could you explain, uh the differences between this H-L-M methodology and some others like uh mixed model (analysis?) are they conceptually same or  	1
MTG485SG142.json	abso- abs- absolutely.   okay are you replacing the one that  uh no this would be for the the second kilohertz computer. oh okay. i have a suggestion though if you_ instead of for a Zip drive, we don't have a lot of them, and which means that they're not too useful. i me- they're use- i they're they're useful if everybody has one and you can trade Zip disks uh but if you don't have_ if you only have one then what's it useful for? so uh if you wanna get one why don't you get an outboard one, that we can then, um, whi- which you know that they also sell them you can, sure   so they they don't have U-S-B ones yet?   U-S-B? oh okay. then they probably or or this other      so i g- i guess we wanna look how many of our computers have U-S-Bs and as long as they're not (xx) mhm those drives are also not very expensive either so we could, you know,      the other thing i wondered about is Zip versus just rewritable C-Ds. mm that's, are those very fast? or well they're  no they're not very fast. s- but  well um, cer- certainly any any machine that you get is gonna have, uh a a uh rewritable C-D, drive on it. because it's more u- more useful than  you just choose what you want  right. um and they are, incredibly useful for for archiving. mhm  what, okay. so i'm, i'm he's, c- he's emailing me a price quote, and then i need to talk to the software guy on Monday, he's out of town. so we're gonna get a, so so so we're g- basically we're replacing the (OMA) but of course we'll still have the (OMA)  uh, the s- S-M-two forty C-D-I spectrometer. so, it's n- it's external miniature spectrometer and then internal card, internal C-P-two card. um okay, so and does that come with a C-C-D yeah, i-   if okay  i- it's  yeah uh the, what i told 'em we wanted, um is it's gonna be three-fifty to ten-fifty nanometers, all at once. three-fifty? is that enough for you? uh    you can't, he said you can go below three fifty, but it's gonna have to be a different grating than this one. and it would be,  okay  i i, i might have to talk to somebody else. i asked him, i asked i said is the high end, because of silicon,  okay. right  right right, so i'll ask on that. um, and it's gonna have point-six nanometer resolution, all the way across, get C and C-plus-plus digital library drivers for it, very cool  i, didn't ask for a LabVIEW. can you ask? sure. um, i know the C C-plus-plus were, they were just giving 'em free, they want, they do the libraries it's all, included. um i thought the LabVIEW stuff was pretty standard too so it's (slit) or fiber coupling, and, i need to talk to the guy on Monday about, uh the (xx) issues. so okay. anything, anything else on that? uh i'll show you the quote when i get it. i  you (got) the order in? the optics (xx) optics. how much did that come to? just over five thousand. what what's in it? uh, lots of mirrors, lots of mounts, m- metal and  okay now  a mirror? the, new focusing mirror for  okay two, two fifty millimeters? or two no, two two hundred and fifty bucks. oh. okay.  okay   you should only do that, if you're trying to solve some problem. if  yeah but do you care? because right  i'm i'm concerned that you'll run into some problem that you don't have now if you make the focal length too short. i mean th- you know ideally you want the focal length very short so you can make the interaction volume small. mhm yes, i think i have a lot of atoms in the focal volume right now. what if you filled the whole mirror, which you can't do right now but will be able to do in the new (chain) setup? if you fill the whole mirror you'll get a tighter focus even with_  okay. so that'll cut down your area wha- so to one quarter, yeah  yeah. so that's what i'm a little concerned about that, because you you know you kind of limit your your range on the other end.  remember when we were first doing, when we you know the first ste- thing we were doing with the high order electrons that you worked on for years remember? oh yeah those. so, the big problem there was we could, somehow never get the intensity low enough to get into the right regime, it was always too high. and that's why we couldn't use that mirror. ultimately we never did use it.  yeah and, and i guess for that, for Mark's, trying to get enough atoms to see anything, you need a larger, he needed  yeah. so, so there's, there's that kind of trade-off so i unless unless you're re- there's really a problem that you're up against,  mhm. and where do i get them from? B-N-C you say. um, connecting, conical anodes to the outside. cuz,     okay. mhm mkay. except that at this point, the anode has a B-N-C connector on it and there might be, one other hermaphrodite connector is buried, before the B-N-C connector but i can't get that part open so i'm not convinced that it actually does open. i really worry if you're using B-N-C that you that you have to make sure that you can bake it. it might be possible. mine, but tha- the B-N-C connector_ i think actually what's in there is okay,  okay it probably doesn't have B-N-C cable, on the other side right?   alright.   can you just take that connector off and put a different, connector on...? i, could.     so right now is the connection the  okay. because, g- i know, the one in the (listening) chamber has, the same kind of thing disassembled, it had a ra- a general radio, connector there. okay. hm. okay. i mean among other things what i'm trying to do is to get, the total length of the connector assembly as short as possible right right... okay, well it sounds like there's a number of possibilities. the easiest possibility would be i- if that, B-N-C connector just happens to have already been modified to be  which you s- think might be true  okay the plastic should look an awful lot like Teflon. and if it   (cuz saying) that the B-N-C  (i don't know what you mean) what can you do to test it? bake it. it's not a bad idea  asse-   so it's only the plates that'd get completely baked. yeah. you could also just, you know you could and also you got the R-G-A you can  and and heat it up yeah. and and you can use the R-G-A to see if you know if weird stuff starts coming out, okay and you could_ we have Teflon downstairs too you can take a look at what Teflon would look like and then just cut open a B-N-C and see  yeah i mean Tef- the problem is that Teflon and the inside of a B-N-C don't look distinctly different.     i've seen them. and then so, you're alwa- you're not, you're not worried about the, the conic anode the B-N-C connector (a- r- or the conflict) frame, port right? no no that we're not worried about. that's all set. okay it's all set? who's o- on so all it is is just that connector sitting on the back of the anode     okay oh it's just you know it's there's a thousand there's a thousand things that can go wrong in an experiment you just have to kind of have them in the back of your mind all at once. so, i wanted to find out, uh about um other stuff to buy because there's something i wanted to bring up, and that is, uh in the ten hertz lab, we have the opportunity to replace, the oscillator, and should we do it? ten kilohertz oscillator? no the    yes, we should. so so is it a higher priority to replace the Clark? or is it a higher priority to push the (Regen) up two kilohertz? we'd still have the multi-pass at ten hertz. i mean... the Clark is a pain because it's it's somewhat unstable. and but the Millenia helped a lot. and the bandwidth is really small but we'd also throw away a lot of the bandwidth if we got a, we don't care about that stuff. i guess i guess my issue on oscillators is tunability. um right so what so do you like the Clark or you don't like the Clark for tunability? the, the Clar- i've never, it's never been easy so but, would a Margaret Henry style be easier? i don't have enough experience with it to really say, um yeah    and if the bandwidth's wide enough then i guess  yeah almost. almost you've got like, you've got at least thirty nanometers yeah. but but  well i know. i_ you know, these, we will not make these kinds of mistakes in the future.  yeah well what it comes down to is the, it's this this i- it's this year end thing. i mean we have we have budgeted, uh upgrading that system. but because upgrading the system is one of those things that you have to stop working to do, somehow it never seems like it's the right time to do it. okay? but we're we're we're running into a time now where it would really be a good idea to spend this money before the end of the year. so that we don't have to carry it over.     (xx) thousand wai- would you get the same um, i mean would you want the same, energy? the same power? or would you do a single (head)       well i are they that bad at Quan- Quantronics?     uh huh that's the positive light one? that's the positive light one. oh mhm (right) no actually i was just thinking about these things i i was just thinking about m- moving up to the kilohertz in s- in in in the ten hertz lab and whether you know i- so i guess you y- it sounds like you'd keep the same amplifier, instead of  mhm      oh ah ha ha, great   i have no, idea this is just, just wondering what, what would we do okay well i   yeah throw it in the garbage uh, i think we could maybe drop it from a very i mean i think, i think i mean the value in the Clark is that we take out all the mounts and optics and we have those. and then all that's left is just some aluminum box   i can replace about half of 'em, anyway so, i mean i don't_ i i'm fine with doing the kilohertz option too. what what y- what years (of) time period do you think that old ten hertz system will be replaced with kilohertz system? i don't think we'll ever replace the back end, the high energy end. i don't think we'll go away from ten hertz for that. because, y- there's always gonna be some di-laser reason or or some high power reason why we'll wha- we'll need that. but if we also are running at a kilohertz for the r- out of the Regen and there's a- then there's obviously new, kinds of experiments that we could do. so so essentially you'd have part of it that could run at ten hertz and part of it at kilohertz? yeah if you only wanted to use the re- output of the Regen you could run (the kilohertz.) but, what's the difference between the Regen output, and the other output? it wouldn't be any, it wouldn't really change.  mhm we get three (millijoules out?) when you see,  we get more like, a little over a millijoule right  well it would be less     mhm  mhm mhm. well it hasn't burned in a while right? just that one time. yeah. so, yeah i'm ju- i'm just trying to figure out though what, where where which experiments benefit from a kilohertz but don't use pulse shaping and can't be done in the other lab, just as easily? oh. so you're sa- you're that's that's the why bother option. yeah the, pulsator could run on a kilohertz right?    that  right mhm   mhm is it in Rackham or here? it's in Rackham.   it's there's cookies and it's s- string theory it's good for you. the most allowed dimensions by super strings  the most allowed dimensions by super strings. uh huh what is that eleven? oh  (that's why) i just picked that up from the abstract so i just know the title which is the world in eleven dimensions. so so before we have to break up for that i really wanted to to have you guys describe this cost functional do you wanna do it? sure. okay um, so i guess the idea is that, well we run the G-A to optimize some pulse shape, or to optimize some feedback, and, uh and we get different different shapes, you know di- different runs of the G-A you you know conversion of different shapes, and, and especially when you look at like a m- a minimization where it spreads the pulse out, and uh and the sh- the shapes that you end up with are sort of uh qualitatively, similar but you couldn't you can't really uh, tell just by looking at 'em what, what's doing what. and, and so the idea is that, well maybe there's just a few things in that pulse shape that that are actually, you know that're actually controlling the uh, the liquid but the rest of that stuff is just i- it doesn't matter. but  so no- non non fatal family traits. right  so the ones that d- how do you  well that's, that's the trick, okay i think_ that's kind of oh it's either squared or  oh okay   mhm right  i think, yeah  yeah yeah if you if i understand tha- that your resolution was, just uh just uh extending the pulses to get some some kind of minimum minimization right? and two ways of doing it one w- way is just le- (linearly) choking it, to make the pulse longer and also, same way, the the the clipping of bandwidth is then making the same (curve-shaped) pulses plus the long pauses. this is this is for, t- only looking at the phases. o- o- this is only_ so then how would you maintain the Gaussian pulse on- only (xx) the phase  uh, we don't look at the amplitudes at all here.  i mean the_ how do you maintain the Gaussian shape without cl- and and and extending the pulse width  when you_ so you're you're asking about the transform-limited pulse that you compare things to? i thought, i mean probably i misunderstood but, you wanted to maintain the transform-limited pulse Gaussian pulse? no, no they don't want to maintain it. they simply want to um, get rid of extraneous garbage and their, their hypothesis about the extraneous garbage which i guess is something you didn't state, but their hypothesis about how how to, differentiate, garbage you don't want from stuff that you might want, is, by looking at the deviation of the phase from the phase that you'd get for transform-limited pulse. so, of course the the, there there's a bunch of problems with that that all come to mind i me- in a kind of a jumble. one is, the one we just talked about, that a Gaussian pulse in a different place doesn't have zero phase and so you have to worry about that. but, uh an- another one is that, you know consider a solution which is a beautiful looking solution just from a kind of aesthetic point of view of, two Gaussian pulses displaced from one another, in time. so it's just like a pump probe thing you're driving a wave packet, and the best solution is you just drive it once, drive it again. okay? there's gonna be a heavy cost here, for that pulse even though that's a perfectly good wonderful solution so i- it seems like th- the lack of sophistication in evaluating cost functional could really be hurting you in some cases. oh um, yeah? w- would you run everything with cost functional or would you, like run  it's designed to be a general tool for any of, any of the experiments in any form. so basically it, you know we can run some experiments and then we can also try 'em with the cost functional and we can try 'em with different weights on the cost functional. mhm yeah so so thi- this is an alternative to something, that was what you guys tried sometimes in the past, which is, having a smoothing operator, that would, that you could just evaluate whether it was a good thing or not cuz of whether it increased the fitness, but the smoothing operator would get rid of extraneous high frequency stuff hi- phase noise for example mostly, mhm that's right it gets rid of the  so alright so the basic idea is that, you know de- depending on what the weighting is, we're gonna, tell it how strong it should punish, anything that deviates from an unshaped pulse. and if, if uh something that deviates drastically has a much better fitness, that'll outweigh the cost. um, so. and that's the trick, to adjust the weighting i guess so, um, you know you you like, you know you like the the weighting factor to be set so that, if you do have a r- a very good pulse shape but it doesn't look anything like a transform-limited pulse, that'll still be, the pulse that you, end up with i guess. unless    yeah, so so Tom has then used this um and and (Jilla) and they he's had some good success with it. basically he had a data analysis that involved looking at, um, looking at the nominator frequency spectrum basically looking at, i guess you know kinda frequency differences in these (Rotmann) experiments, and um, and whether you get these, or whether they're present in the beam or not, and, and  the analysis was cleaned up.   well we've also yet to craft a G-A that that ha- eliminates nonfatal mutations too. so yeah we don't have a better way to eliminate nonfatal mutations a- apart from just going in, uh to the_ looking at a solution, and just feature by feature, modifying it, just l- you know, that's_ course that also, defeats the purpose of the G-A you're not optimizing things uh you're not letting it optimize things for you if you can do that. yeah i- i- it gets into a validation issue really and, um, and i- i've seen the same thing in medical imaging with iterative r- approaches, how much side information can you stick in the e- the image pr- process without biasing the image you end up with? right mhm mhm i mean as long as we're able to run them back to back, i think we can avoid those sort of problems just because you can run it without, and you can run it with and you can compare what the pulse shapes look like  the reason i i guess it seems like if you, get a pulse shape without the cost functional, that looks nothing like the Gaussian, that's, huh,  and, when you use the how much it looks like a Gaussian, is that, what's F-zero F-zero's like the original fitness. without, so the new   so the more cost there is the higher fitness it has? uh i- the minus sign is, i should put plus or minus. yeah, okay. i i  mhm  i mean the i mean the the weighting has to be, the w- the the value of W has to be has to be, examined bu- tha-  mhm  mhm of course if that were really true, the example that you said, then you'd have to wonder what was being added that made the fitness always better, for the noisier pulse and there might be some physics there and you'd never know that physics mhm there's uh well, that's good. i- it would be nice if you if you had a problem that ha- you, had very good reason to believe that a really wacky pulse shape was indeed the best shape, and then run this into this approach and see how close to zero you have to make W to make this work. yeah   no i wa- mkay mm well, i wanna make sure that we can, get over to_ in time to eat cookies of course that's the most important part.  	1
LEL140SU074.json	okay thankful. something. okay um, we have a list of names was it the one who dragged him out of the wood shed? no he came second. well    Kampei. well it wasn't really Kampei because Kampei is dead, remember. but but Kampei because he died, because of the way that he died he made a great sacrifice for his lord he finally killed himself, you know we had that gut-wrenching, scene, literally. um, uh because of that, Kampei is allowed the the first privilege and so, Kampei's wife's brother, Kampei's brother-in-law Heiemon i- who's a very low ranking samurai offers the first incense. uh in Kampei's name. allowing Kampei to do that even in death then to have this great honor. uh, so they go through this, through through the motions. uh, Wakasono- Wakasanosuke Wakasanosuke shows up at the very end, and he and he comes in and he's in a great fluster and he says Oboshi, at the bottom of page one-seventy-nine them, committing yeah them committing it was assumed? it was assumed, certainly. mhm but in the rest of the story it was always, mhm right right right i th- i thought so. because it, you know we do have sort of this um, needless gore, in other parts of the story too and um, this um real ex- extraneous um detailed descriptions of people killing themselves. we don't get that here. does anybody else, anybody have_ yeah? maybe they wanted to end it on, a more happy note. right right mhm right right  but like, the vengeance and then, over. i thought that too. and also there're forty-seven of them so, if we had to give a description of all forty-seven of them committing  oh it is. oh there it is okay alright well i'll just use, this (up here) okay wasn't he a commentator on The Tale of Genji? right, that's right he wrote an important commentary on The Tale of Genji. good. he came up with the idea of eh i was shocked that, uhuh right  yeah a little ethereal right, that's right um, he he allows seven years to go by well anyway he gets ready to depart, mkay uh, i'm again on the first page towards the bottom, and we have a description of his wife Miyagi. well i mean the poem she wrote is, i thought it made it pretty clear that she, right  yeah, i guess the poem does make it pretty clear doesn't it? i- in the original Chinese model, in the original Chinese text she kills herself, it's suicide. but here it, it's apparently not. maybe she dies of a broken heart and um, okay, on one twenty-eight, well these don't have any religious messages. uhuh. that's true. it's not preoccupied with a religious message. good. anything else? the characters are more developed, uhuh right. characters are definitely more developed. we have real, t- believable characters, and a much more complex plot. uhuh. any of you_ anything else? i see people writing furiously. i said that that... mhm 	1
STP175SU141.json	(xx) i had more useful, um comments when each of you only did two, so if you would like to just do two very good evaluations today, that's actually more useful to me and to the people giving the talks, than four yes yes yes yes evaluations, okay, so um, if you could do that. um just a reminder there're a couple of people last week who, forgot to give me their detailed outline and, uh references, um Serena and Reshma if if you need, you need to get those to me, by next week at the latest. people talking today if you don't have your detailed outline and references please get them to me next week, i really, i need to have those. um... i think that's it. once we get this going, we should be all set. oh oh uh (xx) how long is it supposed to be (xx) oh wow okay i'll pencil you in i'll tell you what all i'm gonna be sitting (xx) back there, yeah  it's (a bull.)   hey Paul you the man. you the man. (okay whatever you do don't) trip on anything. don't trip on anything? because then we're (xx) to go forward. (xx) oh okay alright okay alright okay uh i am uh, Paul Land if you don't know me i'm doing my uh, presentation on Mad Cow Disease and other, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. okay, uh what really is Mad Cow Disease? it's just uh, it's just the easier name for the disease called Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy which means um, encephalopathy means just a bad thing in your brain, spongiform means your brain will look like a sponge and then bovine happens in cattle. uh it's just one of many diseases that are called um T-S-Es or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which are just, uh you know your brain is just like a sponge and it's transmitted from species to species sometimes or just from, uh animal to animal. um, many other well known, uh T-S-Es are scrapie in sheep, and uh Creutzfeld-Jakob disease which affects us humans. uh what is a T-S-E um, what happens it it's a uh spongy degeneration of the brain which means your brain will look like a sponge, which means there's gonna be holes in your brain. which is kind of bad because you don't want holes in your brain, so um, this will cause uh, severe then eventual fatal, uh neurological damage which you'll just die, uh it doesn't last too long, um what causes this is something called a prion which is a protein which i will, get into later, uh (xx) means just it's a bad way to die. it's quick it's painful and, you're gonna die no matter what. you said if you eat enough that you could potentially get it like do you know any kind of amounts that you would have to eat? they don't know oh  if you ate one hamburger? yeah   is this at all related to hoof and mouth disease? no and a lot of people are asking that because, i think it's transmitted the same way it goes from cow to cow by eating cows but it's just another disease in cattle that's not a transmissible, spongiform encephalopathy it's you know it's not prions it's just a disease in cows. i think it's spreading like it was with Mad Cow but it's a total different disease. so, yeah. i heard something about elk in the West   but that's, we we don't have any B-S-E in the U-S either. no so far the elk hasn't gone from another species  and is there has there been any, evidence of, B-S-E or scrapie going to, birds like chicken or, i i know there's been a lot of transmission through to other mammals but i was wondering  so chicken's safe? yeah i didn't see anything on chicken no... is that good? okay thanks Paul. (xx) okay it's already set up to work so (xx) um did you have (xx) okay well um... we will try to make it work yes (xx) yeah (thanks) oh, (you can) point (in it?) point yeah just (xx) hi i'm Gary uh i'm doing hypoxia. if you were here last week and listened to (Sladie's) presentation, just disregard everything. you know, pretend you didn't learn anything. yeah let's see if we can get this to work. okay, so we (xx) technical difficulties. doesn't it always happen, we always have technology problems no matter (xx) alright now we have to switch this. alright alright, here's me suffering from symptoms at ten-thousand feet. that's you?  did we see you come down safely? yeah i was fine. which one's yours (xx) yeah... take a look (xx) it might take a few minutes to make it work (xx) alright my name is Brett Boaton and i'm gonna be talking about, uh ventricular septal defect and other congenital heart disorders if it doesn't    did- you pressed the forward arrow right? yeah sorry (xx) it's never done this before. (xx) oh yeah (xx) oh come on. isn't there like someplace you can like (xx) fix computers for you. well, it's not even mine (xx) anybody with particularly good karma, today? are the wires working this time? i mean c- yes, okay oh okay   this is just the last time. what if you turned it off and started all over? yeah that's a possibility... except i can't really turn it off i can only restart it because i can't i can't get it run- i can't turn it (on.) okay i'm gonna make the executive decision to give it up... oh sweet i'm so happy i went first oh my god yeah Mad Cow Disease, by some very hot shot public health types it's gonna be at the School of Public Health tomorrow, in their, School of Public Health Auditorium number two, School of Public Health Building Two, Auditorium. i think that's what it is. it starts at eleven thirty and it goes to one forty-five, um if you're interested that's going on tomorrow. um we have, two proctors of the week this week, um first of all the honorable mentions this week are Andy Snarf Jeff Mack and Mosen Meladie but our winners this week are Brett Boatman and Sandi Johan. yay any questions comments things you're beginning to worry about in terms of the end of the semester, student problems? i see that the, ceiling is still not fixed.  so they were just ignoring you. yeah oh one morning i came in and they were in there and they said they were gonna come back soon and fix it. and that was like  i, i know that they do have trouble if there's still ice on the roof for example they can't get to where they need to be but the that's of course why it's leaking. okay. um how are the students doing are they, keeping up or are we still having people coming in on linear days, they doing alright  i think like the last week wasn't that good (xx) (starting) to fall behind they're starting to fall behind? yeah no the numbers of quizzes i mean we're up to like um almost ten pretty soon, and uh most people (got like) six or seven  yeah i had three. okay you you you guys can, can be, you can help them, you can say you gotta get on it now. you can say do you want me to call Doctor Zappa and make her yell at you i mean i will do that but,  Wolfe Wolfe? don't turn this. okay so i just push (xx) it goes like that if you break it then you're dead.    (alright) my name's John uh i'm doing necrotizing fasciitis, uh if you don't know what that means that's alright cuz, it's actually a pretty rare disease and it wasn't until like the nineteen nineties the media got a hold of it, and uh they coined the term, flesh eating disease. ooh ew whoa uh hit cancel you'll pull  alright so scientists believe this same protein causes the immune system not only to, fight the bacteria and try to kill it but also kill the um, the flesh, around it so, that is also another sign of how rapid it can uh spread cuz it's almost like a two on one, action going. you have the bacteria which is killing the flesh and then you also have the immune system which is trying to kill the bacteria and the flesh at the same time. and then what we know of the anaerobic bacteria is that it causes a to- it gives off toxic gas in the tissue and this causes like a cytotoxic um, hypoxia_ what Gary was kind of talking about last week. and, so it kind of st- starves the tissue of oxygen. and that's all i could find on anaerobic bacteria. to lower your risk um like i said, prompt diagnosis the sooner you b- the sooner you find it the better your chances are, and uh, keep your skin intact don't, cut if you get cuts you know band-aids whatever and, good hygiene. so, we talked about what it is bacterial disease, really rare but um really deadly, and you get you get it from a cut and, i- you can it's passed from strep- uh people that have strep A. and symptoms are the swelling of it and flu-like symptoms. and the treatment uh, is to basically remove the tissue, and we talked about how it eats cuz it has that M protein and the hyaluronic capsule which it kinda, get away, from the phagocytes and then to lower your risk, you uh, basically have good hygiene and uh prompt diagnosis... there are my references, any questions? okay let's say that you thought you had this but it didn't like, start eating your flesh yet,  um actually that's a good question um, i found that, they take a sample of your blood and they, test a lot of stuff and i heard um, the one test that helps the most cuz it's ki- it's really hard to tell especially at the beginning but M-R-Is i guess, um can test for it in the early stages and help doctors tell if it's, um, necrotizing fasciitis or not. but yeah usually, that's why it's so deadly cuz after you find it it's, you can_ after it's found it's after the symptoms have like progressed to, um, so bad.  yeah i i have no idea about that. maybe it's cuz they scratch all the time. yeah yeah,  thanks alright uh, once again, i'm Brett Boaton and i'll be doing ventricular septal defect and other congenital heart disorders. um first off a congenital disorder is just simply a disorder that's present at birth. and uh, congenital abnor- abnormalities account for the majority of, uh of deaths of children under one year of age. um, as you can see from these numbers right here, uh there's about eighteen deaths per one-hundred thousand live births, of children less than one year old, and as you get older the number of deaths decrease. uh congenital heart disorders are often divided into two types there's are those are cyanotic which is uh blue discoloration caused by a relative lack of oxygen, or those are they're non-cyanotic. the most common cyanotic is uh known as the tetralogy of Fallot which i will be discussing later. uh the most common non-cyanotic ones are ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. uh ventricular septal defect is the most common of the, uh congenital heart disorders and is seen three times as often as uh A-S-D and P-D-A... um, the most cases of C-H-D the cause is unknown and difficult to determine, however there seems to be a strong genetic linkage, especially since, parents who have had one child with a, congenital heart disorder tend to have an increased risk of, having another child with a, congenital heart disorder. this increase in risk ranges from about one in one-thousand to about one in twenty. um, also infections in the mother are usually associated with children having abnormal hearts. uh here is a diagram of the heart and before i go into the specifics of uh V-S-D, it's important to review the anatomy and, cycle of the heart. uh se- as you can see here the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava, they dump blood into the right atrium, and pa- the right atrium it goes into the, right ventricle, from the right ventricle it goes through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where it loads up on oxygen. it returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, from here the blood flows down into the left ventricle, from the left ventricle it flows to the aorta up here, and the aorta it goes to the rest of the organs throughout the body, known as the systemic circuit. um of the forty thousand babies born each year with an abnormal heart, nine thousand of these babies have what is known as a ventricular septal defect. it's commonly referred to as a hole in the heart for it is simply a, hole in the septum that divides the left and right ventricles, uh this ven- this defect may, will vary in size from small to moderate to large. may vary in the location, possibly along the uh septum or near the heart valves, it also will vary in the number with multiple defects possible. um this hole in the septum allows blood to flow, uh back and forth between the left and right ventricle, and uh the amount and direction of flow is usually based on two things, one the size of the defect with larger defects obviously allowing, more blood to pass through, and also the directi- uh the resistance, the sys- if the systemic resistance is higher than the pulmonary resistance, which is the uh usual circumstance in childhood, the blood w- the blood will flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. in other words the blood is taking the uh path of least resistance, and also since the pressure in the, uh left ventricle is much higher than the blood uh pressure in the left vent- right ventricle, and as you know fluids always tend to flow from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure. um, this defect will allow the blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle and from the right ventricle it will then enter the uh pulmonary arteries increasing the workload on the lungs... uh here's a picture, of a V-S-D, here you see the hole up there allowing the oxygen rich blood and the oxygen poor blood to mix, and the blood then, flows from the higher region to the_ higher pressure region to the lower pressure region and down through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. here is uh another diagram of a normal heart versus a uh V-S-D, um, you can see here the on the right side the mixing of the blood, and the blood will then flow up through the pulmonary arteries into the lungs... uh there're different types of V-S-Ds based on their anatomic location, there are peri-membranous V-S-Ds which are located in the, membranous septum. which is uh, usually located near the heart valves. or you may have a uh muscular V-S-D which is located in the uh, lower portion of the septum. there're also inlet and outlet V-S-Ds which are located near the, uh entrance to the ventricular chamber and the exit, to the ventricular chamber respectively, uh membranous V-S-Ds account for about eighty percent, of uh congenital heart defects and, uh muscu- muscular V-S-Ds account for about ten percent. uh the symptoms of V-S-D usually include uh frequent respiratory infections, uh shortness of breath sweating paleness, you'll have a increased uh heart rate, and increased breathing due to the uh, extra workload on the heart and lungs, and you'll also will have_ typically have an arrhythmia, which is a disruption in the heart's electrical conduction system which controls the contraction of the atrium and the ventricles. uh possible cause of V-S-D, uh they think if the mother has uh rubella during pregnancy it might be transmitted to the fetus. or uh poor pre-natal nutrition, uh the mother drinks alcohol uh possibly diabetes, and if the mother is over forty years old. from these causes it is, easy to see some possible preventions, if the mother does have r- the mother should be vaccinized against rubella before pregnancy, uh avoid alcohol eat healthy and if they have diabetes make sure they control it uh during and before pregnancy. uh there're many ways to test for a V-S-D uh cardiologists will often use a, just a teth- stethoscope to listen for a heart murmur since a heart murmur is often the first clue of a V- a V-S-D. they also might use a electrocardiogram, which measures the directional spread of electrical activity in the heart. uh often they use echocardiograms which uh evaluate the valves and chambers. they do this by placing uh a transducer on the child's ribs, this transducer, picks up the echoes of high frequency sound waves, and transmit them, to electrical impulses which are then sent to an electrocardiogram machine_ echocardiogram machine. um, there're still questions remaining about the heart's anatomy or if these symptoms seem, uh out of proportion to the size of the defect they will often use a uh, a cardiac catheter. and uh (in) this catheter they make a small incision in the groin and they send it up through a blood vessel to the heart. using X-ray images to guide it through, um they also might use cardiac angiography which measures the degree of blocked blood flow in the coronary arteries, they often might use uh oxygen saturation tests. um if a child has a small defect uh fortunately it'll often, often close on it's own spontaneously, however however (if) the defect is, uh fr- rather large, uh medications such as uh digitalis and diuretics are used. uh digitalis improves the strength and efficiency of the heart, and uh controls the rate of the heartbeat. while diuretics will uh remove excess fluid that builds up in the lungs, which will also uh reduce the workload of the heart. um if the hole is still rather large after a couple years surgery is often necessary, and they do the surgery using a heart lung bypass machine, and they emplace a patch over the defect. here on the left you can see a uh, hole in the septum there. and on the right they've put uh, a small patch on it. usually, this one is made out of fabric uh Dakron, often they will use the patient's own tissue uh, their own pericardian tissue. uh and here's another picture of a uh patched up defect, you can see there is no longer any mixing of the blood, between the left and right ventricle. if left untreated uh V-S-D can lead to congestive heart failure in which the uh the blood is no longer able to meet the demands of the body. if the blood becomes backed up into the uh liver and G-I tract people have a, right sir- right sided heart failure. or if the blood becomes backed up into the lungs you'll have a left sided heart failure. uh most importantly a V-S-D can leave to, lead to infective endocarditis. and uh infective endocarditis is an infection of the linings of the valves and chambers of the heart. um, most common one is bacterial endocarditis, which is usually caused by uh streptococcus viridians, uh this will cause uh li- infections in the lining of the blood, and and uh you'll see some growths and these growths may dislodge and send clots to the brain or lungs. uh you also may see arrhythmias and delayed growth from children zero to five years old. um a very closely related defect is atrial septal defect, it pretty much shows the same symptoms as a ventricular septal defect instead of now there is a hole between the, uh left and right atrium, and you'll see an increase in blood flow in the pulmonary arteries, just like a V-S-D, uh here's a picture of an A-S-D, at the top you see there's a hole, which allows the blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, down through the right ventricle and out to the pulmonary arteries. just like in a V-S-D. um a V-S-D may be part of a, larger scheme of malformation known as a tetralogy of Fallot. this occurs when the heart does not develop properly in the mother's womb, uh it is characterized by uh, a narrow region that leads from the uh right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, and since there's this region's very narrow the right ventricle has to work much harder to get the blood past the blockage, which causes the right ventricle to thicken. uh that is the ventricular hypertrophy. you also have a V-S-D and a uh aortic override, and uh... in this picture you see the rather large aortic valve, which causes the, pulmonary valve on the left to be very narrow. and now this high pressure right ventricle region, will cause blood to flow from the right ventricle to the left ventricle, and out so the uh systemic circuit to the left arm and brain, and since this blood (convicts) and then, go out to the rest of the body the baby will often appear blue, uh usually under its fingernails and its lips... um in nineteen_ in the mid-eighties the N-I-H initiated a series of uh research programs for, cardiac development and now there're currently, one hundred laboratories around the world dedicate full time to this, um they use frogs, fish, chickens rats and mice and fruit flies, in uh one particular fruit fly they found a gene that was needed to develop a heart, and embryos without this, uh gene do not develop a heart so they named it the Tinman Gene. of course after the Wizard of Oz character, um, they also discovered more than thirty other proteins that are import- important to heart development, uh such as muscle development valve formation and the electrical conduction system, uh one group in Cincinnati they produced a mouse without a gene... hold on must be something i didn't, load right. alright um, they found a mouse without a gene for the transforming growth factor beta-two and this uh mouse showed all the symptoms of a tetralogy of Fallot. they also, studied patients in East Finland with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, uh this is relevant since muscular V-S-Ds, are often seen in patients with uh, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy more often then the general pediatric population, uh they found mutations in exon nineteen of the beta M-A-C gene and in uh, exon five of the alpha-tropo-miacine gene, interes- interestingly enough they found that, patients with uh mutations in the cardiac, beta-miacine (xx) all had V-S-Ds. um although V-S-Ds are typically congenital you can still get later in life, i read about one case in South Carolina where a five-year-old boy was shot in the chest by his brother with a B-B gun. and the, the pellet ripped a hole through his heart and was later found in his apex. uh fortunately surgery removed the apex and patched up the V-S-D. um the outlook for a complete recovery in patients with a small defect is excellent. as i said before they will often just close on their own. um, uh, these patients with small defects can actually participate in any physical activity any sport, um and even for large defects the outcome of surgery is very good, however if uh if left untreated many complications can arise. in conclusion, most causes of congenital heart disease are unknown, and they seem to be uh, genetic. uh ventricular septal defect is the most common of these congenital heart disorders, and is simply just a hole between the left and right ventricles, uh V-S-D may be part of a larger scheme known as a tetralogy of Fallot which is often very serious and, always requires surgery. also genetic research on cardiac development is still in its infancy and, many developments are sure to come. i chose this topic because um, i was actually born with a V-S-D, at about one week old i went into congestive heart failure, i had an arrhythmia, and my heart rate went up to about a hundred and sixty beats per minute, which really mean_ you're supposed to die when that happens but, lucky me i guess. i assume you had surgery. uh, actually i didn't have surgery. they only put me on uh, digitalis for uh, about a year. i had to take two drops a day, for a entire year, and, the hole actually closed on its own, fortunately. Gary? why East Finland? is there something special about East Finland? i don't know. who knows. well i jus- i just have_ did you know that the Tinman Gene was discovered here at University of Michigan  okay. thank you alright (xx) uh, okay did you, do the  (i thought) the uh first trimester is the most important uh one for, restraining your drinking (xx) did you read anything about like drinking after the, se- second (term?) i mean i mean yeah uh, not with me i mean obviously, because the baby the fetus is growing more in the first and second trimester, i mean that's when most of the neurological stuff does happen, but still i mean they are they are trying to do research to find out which stage in the pregnancy is the worst but, i mean i didn't come across one thing that said it's okay to drink in the, s- third trimester it's it's okay to drink in the eighth month i mean any alcohol consumed will affect the baby. did you find any stuff that said um, it was eas- or it wasn't as bad when they did it through breast feeding? no i mean, i mean the breast feeding thing i mean that's not the that's not it_ breast feeding the baby's already done Fetal Alcohol Syndrome's actually alcohol in utero, it's when the baby is developing and that just affects the amount of breast milk, and it can cross from the mother to the baby, through the through milk. (and that's what i understood) i know this isn't, what you were looking at but did you read anything about how, alcohol can harm sperm and therefore there is an effect from, paternal drinking. um, no honestly. yeah um you know how you showed that picture of the little girl behind bars. yeah   thank you again. yeah, you are it's jus- just the biochem? (xx) (xx) stress and cortisol you nervous? yeah lemme show you here how to work this (oh sorry) yeah okay hi i'm Anjali Balaff i'm gonna be talking about stress and cortisol today, and um all the negative effects of that. this is a little, uh it's just a brief outline of what i'm talking about first i'll go into a little bit about stress, uh and the different types of it the symptoms, then i'll talk more about cortisol and then i'll debate the two. um, okay. stress is just basically defined as a reaction of the mind and body against change, the change doesn't have to be an unpleasant one it could be a good change a bad change it's just something that your body's not ready to face that creates stress. and it produces bodily or mental tension it's caused by pressure to meet demands or, just things that your body isn't ready to, uh face. there're mainly three types of stress the first is mechanical stress and that's caused by physical, factors like lifting heavy objects exercising too much or not exercising enough. uh mental stress is caused by emotional aspects or social aspects and that's uh, like not getting enough sleep or marriage problems relationship problems uh, work problems things like that. and finally there's chemical stress which is a much broader category but it's mostly a, chemical input uh in your body and environmental factors, so it's caused by pollution or um, fumes from your furniture or carpets things you may not think that could cause stress but they do. those are chemicals uh, oops it's jus- did you see anything about, stress and cortisol levels in relationship to um cancer survival? yeah um i s- like it was mentioned in a lot of the articles i read but not like it was also mentioned in the H-I-V article but they never really elaborated on it. so i'm not really sure what the correlation is. there is a correlation but i think there's still a lot of research being done on it so they're not really sure yet. thank you again. okay, alright (xx) (xx) it's gonna be alright now (xx) okay um my name's Paveny by the way um and my talk today's gonna be on obesity, um i's actually just gonna start off with this, i found a really funny article while i was looking this up about how, um the cartoon Fat Albert actually, promoted young children to go out and eat more engage in like is Michigan still (number one) fattest state? yeah... thank you everybody um, five piles on the front and if you wanna look at my new computer (you can) 	1
INT425JG002.json	(xx)   very shocking it's really normal. it's what speech looks like. when you, take down everything. nobody speaks, like those neat dialogues in language    hm', yeah that's (fine) okay, good... actually it's, it's an example of something you do, um, and, i- in, in the meetings, um that i hope we'll get to a little bit later, to, talking about it. um, i think it's really nice. i have some questions to ask you. how long have you been in the U-S...? uh... uh, okay, i'm gonna give you the, the history of it yeah uhuh mhm mhm uhuh... mhm mhm  yeah mhm yeah...  uhuh, since ninety-six, since January ninety-six, yeah, okay. and, um, before, before you came to the University of Michigan, what was your educational experience i know you, um... um, you mentioned actually in this conversation, um going to university in the capital of your country? mhm yeah i, got a degree in... uh, agronomic engineering agronomic? yeah, it's a, one of those, third world degrees, that you do, basically, the way i see it is mhm mhm mhm mhm do a graduate degree. yeah and uh, therefore, uh, there's a... a bunch of, aspects and, things that are packed together yeah mhm, mhm uhuh yeah right right uhuh  yeah uhuh, uhuh yeah right right i wonder if there's anything like that, like at M-S-U, at the, sort of oh they have plant science.  uhuh yeah yeah... yeah mm  yeah right  yeah yeah right... so when did you get, to thinking about, um, environmental issues and... doing, a nat- you know, think about natural landscapes say as opposed to farming and oh, i ju- i just never felt, really, comfortable doing what i was doing uhuh  mhm yeah mm mm yeah yeah right mhm mhm yeah yup  yeah, yeah mhm mhm  yeah  right, right. how'd you pick Michigan? uh... i actually did a, search mhm uhuh mhm yeah  mhm mhm      yeah uhuh mhm yeah uhuh right uhuh, uhuh yeah right uhuh uhuh mhm yeah  yeah mhm mhm uhuh yeah yeah mhm yeah yeah hm yeah uhuh yeah right. right. yeah. and the Ma- the Master's project does sound like it was, pretty appealing to you, and th- that it still is, that the, um, yeah yeah it is i actually w- it wasn't my first preference though. oh okay uhuh no. there was this, th- this project was, like, i liked it it's  uhuh is this joint implementation of, environmental standards that were yeah it's carbon sequestration oh  right. uhuh yeah right mhm   yeah right right uhuh cleansing.   mhm mhm oh yeah. yeah  yeah mhm mhm uhuh, uhuh uhuh  yeah yeah yeah  yup uhuh uhuh yeah, yeah mm. yeah yeah yeah. right yeah uhuh, mhm right, right yeah yeah so things you weren't really, yeah mhm  yeah yeah yeah great  oh yeah (xx) really. yeah well yeah, and i just had a problem with a professor (xx) uhuh yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah i think, yeah. being a student is a really disempowered position. 	1
DEF420SF022.json	alright well, welcome, all of you, to th- i think we shoulda got a bigger room, but we didn't yeah well, history of, of my involvement with the topic is, is a, is a personal story, and since the, uh, since that story has undergone obviously uh, the attempt of objectification, in the process of writing, i uh, chose to, to keep this, introductory uh, summary, personal, um, in the hope that that will, get us going, uh with the questions. gee, i feel like clapping that was really, great. okay, alright well now we'll get down to the hard part. okay we'll go around the table and we'll uh uh, ask questions make comments, whatever, so Bob, you wanna start,   oh you've got a different oh one-forty-five i'm sorry okay. yeah yeah well i you have the only different um, i i you know when we first started to, discuss this uh project in_ or at least when you gave your uh, your your colloquium, i know one of the the issues that was uh, uh sort of floating around in my mind at the time was was the question of, sort of historical context chronology, and and so forth and, of course you've chosen to do a, uh, a a nonchronological approach although we do get, a a nice biographical sketch of Jarrett at the very beginning, but um, you know there there seem to be so many changes in his career, uh, of position and interest and so forth, so that when, for instance i came to this uh this portion, i believe you were talking about a concert that took place in_ this is the Kyoto concert of nineteen, seventy-six or yeah mhm mhm. actually the this particular uh, element of of Jarrett wanting to make, the piano sing, like a voice, uh is one that he has, uh expressed and keeps expressing today, um uh throughout his career. i guess i chose that uh particular quote, um bec- because i found it the most eloquent of those   mhm  mhm  well i'd be u- i mean it's a good, good response i i guess i'm looking for something even littl- just a little more, on the technical side  mhm  right ah  mhm it is. mhm   yeah okay yeah um, i i think you're right i think you're reading it right y- y- ya- that there was trying to avoid that kind of uh, uh exclamation mark uh at the end of my phrases. and uh and the the process of coming full circle with which i concluded the opening remark, is still a very young, uh, uh, process, it's it's still very recent um, and part of it has to do with the fact that uh, that the interviews that we had, uh were so different from, from how interviews, are radiated in in magazines uh, and, uh i asked him about this in fact it all started by me_ my asking him why he wanted_ why the heck he wanted to talk to me, i mean because he really doesn't need to and so forth and, and he said that he likes it when uh when interviewers, aren't out uh, to get him, or or to get something you know to get something that then, uh uh four weeks later comes up in the magazine as him having said some outrageous thing and, and uh, you know and uh he- he- very candidly would address uh things, of that nature that he has said outrageous things and he has contradicted himself and, so what? you know, we do it, people do it it happens. and um, uh in conversation uh with me, uh because i i i wasn't coming from, i wasn't hired to do this i wasn't doing it for a deadline project next week to have it, published, i wasn't out to catch some uh, provocative remark, uh he seemed to uh feel, less defensive so m- my perspective, uh, uh on a lot of those comments that have stirred controversy around him uh have to do with also looking at, the process of how those comments were made and uh and and um, in which situation they were maked and how_ were made and how they were sparked. so um uh, having had the interviews ar- uh is certainly an experience that is, that, is part of uh, rec- rectifying some of that  thanks okay, alright, John (xx) yeah, um, let me ask you some some technical things that's on the, on the, the note guide here, um... there're a bunch, there- there're many little things in here i'd like you to just take a look at mhm (xx) mhm... ah. um, uh i- di- y- did you listen to it on the tape? yeah i i i i really did i do hear it as A-flat major and in fact one of the reasons why uh why i chose the key signature of three flats instead of four flats, is uh the predominance of the the Lydian scale in A-flat, with the rai- raised fourth mm  hm. well, this this to me just sounds like a million, tunes through jazz history that start on four chords okay um, you know there're tons of blues tunes for instance, chop off the first four bars of a blues, and use the last eight bars twice okay   alright but maybe i i i don't know maybe maybe i'm, i'm wrong. in any case you said shortly after this, the ruling key signature A,  okay uh  mhm  yeah. well, uh, uh, right, but i mean it's like a world of difference   yeah  mhm  yes go ahead, yeah okay, here's another thing about keys. page seventy-two... uh, this piece... uh, seems to have practically no B naturals in it... mhm right mhm   i i i think what's what's happening is that um, uh, you know that i- it's, it's the same uh, principle that we talked about with the the, A-flat i mean i accept your argument that the A-flat wasn't uh, uh the best solution to to uh, take as a as a start- harmonic starting point mhm mhm   okay, uh, you- you're right i  right   yeah. go. um a- y- you're right especially in a context uh where it is so diaton- where it is so so diatonical,   mhm... mhm mhm mhm mhm um, uh at some point in the analysis later on i'm uh uh, i'm talking about how uh how Jarrett uh contrasts the, the um, the standard chord changes of of the head with um, with what he okay   right, but but tha- uh  but how do i know that reading this? if you're if you're saying, look at the way, Jarrett's actual realization of the piece contrasts with the way the piece was composed, okay yeah    uh, and i i mean they're just they're just, it's j- absolutely full of them yeah so so you would say that i- before the transcription before the     oh really? it's in the text here   no, no i think you're right it's not before the   right c- may i may i, uh  mhm mhm mhm mhm  mhm well that that, that's perfectly fine i think that's, that's a good thing to do. one last thing i wanted to ask you about this is, why you quote, the Real Book version of this piece rather than the original music. okay. mhm it's not the  right right okay. i think that's a very good suggestion. at this point in my argument uh, i- uh, the the reason for the Real Book version, uh, was um my talking about rhythmic displacements, mhm  mhm no well it may be, different in some   yeah. i i'd like to um my other stuff is just little, little nitpicky fussy stuff that you can deal with, at your leisure okay, great. okay oh, one one thing about, about the abstract, yeah oh my, you didn't get the um, we all have that we all have that? oh my gosh well computer ate  uh,  well, i'm sure that's  let me just  mhm okay this is what you get for vocalizing while you type. yeah Nicolas? i i i'm_ you're lucky i can't nitpick because i picked up the wrong version, you should have color-coded them. they were   oh, oh uh the Real Book? yeah. it's illegal to produce it's not illegal to own it but it's illegal to, reproduce something that's illegal isn't it? uh not unless you're gonna sell it to somebody but i mean, in, in in in yeah i uh    especially for this well the dissertation is full of copyrighted material and i mean the the   uh i i will be able to do that um, if i mark off the, box that it's not for sale yet oh. yeah. that it's just for the record mhm mhm and that's legal and people have to come to you for the  yeah. uh it's just uh i haven't had the time to go through that whole process. you just asked_ i'm still a little unclear about, the role of free jazz and all of in in in in in in um, whatever, you know what i mean, by that. um in in in uh, in in the way in which you've, described this because, um, you allude to, to Ornette Coleman at, a number of places, and then you discuss rather interestingly Paul Bley. and i just wonder, how how they, uh, they really function in this because, part of the problem, was brought up by Jarrett's own statements, as you've j- already mentioned a couple of times, that it's his denial, quote unquote of his, of his roots and then, your, uh uh searching for, the historical background of his work, and, i suppose that part of this would_ one would've never attempted part of this is if he hadn't said these things. um, but, w- w- w- w- w- what is interesting here is for instance, you talk about if i remember correctly about, the two saxophone work as being, going back to Ornette Coleman, and that puzzled me, that is i don't still don't understand, you mentioned Coleman's influence a number of times but you never specify what it is if i remember correctly except for that one statement. and that puzzled me because, you referred to f- to, the double quartet, but this isn't really a two saxophone front line that's it's a, four instrument fr- front line and the two saxophones don't have any particular, mhm mhm um, uh uh your your comment brings out_ your question brings out that i need to be more precise uh uh on on why i'm uh, uh drawing that comparison. it's actually not about having two two saxophones specifically it's about having two lead wind instruments, um uh, uh that, uh, are uh set in an instrumentation that avoids piano. so um uh Coleman's ensembles with uh Don Cherry on trumpet, uh are are just as much a resource for me, than the double quartets, be- because the issue is, uh free improvisation in a setting, uh in which two melodic uh uh improvisers, play simultaneously, uh, with uh, without the, the chordal, underpinnings of of, of the piano. if i remember correctly you you you you specifically referred to, to free jazz with the two saxophone, for for his work with Charles Lloyd. and, mhm   uh i don't have  it's early on in the   right mhm we- uh, the album Footloose that i talk about is, uh, i don't know the date offhand but it is one of the early  right mhm mhm mhm yeah right which i address actually mhm yeah you're talking about wind players wind players yes, b- but uh but uh but there're also pianists of course who were doing this, since time immemorial uh, but but but this idea of recording these solo, album lengths, so i mean in Braxton's case they were all double albums, uh, of of solo work and also Braxton talks about this, extensively in the liner notes to, to uh his uh s- s- second or third long one the um, what is it, nineteen seventy-nine, mhm uhuh  mhm mhm mhm   yeah this was one of the, the things i i haven't completely transcribed the uh, the, the interviews with him yet but this was very specifically something that he did ad- did address uh um, uh saying that, the A-A-C-M and uh, that he was looking at the A-A-C-M at the time as as something, interesting musically that he that he drew from. i mean he uh i was surprised by how little, shy he was to acknowledge that connection when so many public statements, uh, veer away from that,  no there are lots of uh i- interviews where he uh, uh talks like that before as well it's just the uh the ones where, uh he pronounces his refusal of artistic lineage uh are more eye-catching or ear-catching. the- they're simply, they, they're more heard. i mean there're plenty plenty of interviews that that express that. i think um, they're usually interviews in which he was uh, felt, cornered, uh uh about that issue, and i think what's also coming through is that as much as he comes out of the free, uh jazz e- uh era and i- is invested in in, in uh, the processes of freely improvising, uh he also um, he he dislikes, the interpretation of free jazz as being, taken uh to be an avoidance of a, a a categorical avoidance of harmonic, structures and tonal language. um, uh in other words, and and the the, when i saw him last week he was, dancing around this very carefully to uh to make sure he he didn't, come out saying, that he thinks Roscoe Mitchell is recording what he is recording because he, can't, play uh uh within tonal structures or over chord changes or so forth, but he was, he he was, avoiding saying that and reverting it back to himself saying, um, uh, well uh not to pass pa- pass judgment on on anybody else uh i i i guess i was very greedy i guess i wanted, more i wanted free improvising but I also wanted tonality i also wanted uh, uh harmony i also wanted, transitory moments of chord changes that then would dissolve again and so forth. so that there was uh clearly this intent to to say, uh yes this was the the spark that, that launched my entire, uh uh idea of how to improvise how to go about playing, uh but it was also something uh, that he, felt was dissatisfactory to his own, tastes, that it was that that much of A-A-C-Ms music uh, was so clearly defined within uh, within the parameters of uh, atonal, uh, nontonal, improvisation, uh sort of with this cliche of being very dissonant, that kind of thing. so he sought uh to to, to revert to tonal structures, within freely improvised settings, rather than um, seeing those, uh, as exclusives of each other. we- i i i think that he just doesn't listen very, much to, the Art Ensemble of Chicago or to Lester Bowie's recordings because they, especially in their let see after the early sixties their work, their whole concerts consist of passages where they do whole   yeah do you think he's manipulating you?  no i think we all talk differently to different people but, um my impr- my impression was simply that he, he was, uh uh, he was trying to say that yes he has a lot to do with that, w- but but he doesn't like much of what came out of it, so he uh, he didn't make it a big deal in his public statements to say yes I owe a lot to A-A-C-M mm well i- may i say this that that that as a result that you might want to reintegrate because of the obviously the the interview you did with him or interviews were done at the very end, right    yeah good point yeah i i th- i mean first of all you're right to that i need to integrate my interviews uh but also, uh it's true that i f- played off of that denial notion because it is it is that, most visible pole o- uh with, from which that controversy uh right and then it   what i do in the text is, show, that there are, uh that there is another side to that, rather than, uh putting it into his words that's very true, i think what i can add is that uh, that is not only something that he has done, uh uh throughout his career that it's also something that he, has addressed at various points. and it's uh it's interesting i'm not uh, sure whether you're familiar with the Edward Strickland interviews uh that were done for the Fanfare Magazine, um uh Strickland was very much, somebody that uh, he f- uh, whatever were the circumstances of the interview but it was a very uh easygoing interview and he liked Strickland and he liked how they were um, uh relating to each other and uh it's it tends to be those interviews that he, says, those kinds of things. uh and it tends to be interviews such as with Jim Aikin in in in the Keyboard Magazine, uh uh where he gets more defensive   so no- no- no- now Wynton is going to, Wynton Marsalis is going to send Stanley Crouch to, knock him out uh i wanted to say uh uh one more thing about the uh Ornette Coleman reference uh, you you went on to the, the Bley um, aspect and i didn't have a chance to comment on that um, uh y- uh when you talked about Paul Bley you were talking about how, the musicians Bley was with, then uh, uh later played with with Jarrett and that, you know in order to point out how important that that influence is, and i agree, uh, but that was also one of the reasons why i did choose, uh uh Coleman as a as an example because both uh Charlie Haden and, and Dewey Redman, which then were part of, uh um Jarrett's American quartet which really was the first, the first ens- ensemble that he, uh, came to a reputation with as a leader, um, were musicians that had uh that had played with, with Coleman. so my my reference to Coleman is not only that there's some instrumentational, similarity going on here, uh but it's it's in the same manner as the Paul Bley uh quintet, it's uh it's a trading of musicians that that went on, which uh, which of course doesn't only mean that these people bring their their styles uh, uh to to the band but it also means that they bring, the sh- conceptually sh- shared background with them, um, which was forged or imp- influenced, by um, their work with with Ornette Coleman. but but but i- i- would pr- like to see if these are suggest that you- that you dig a little deeper that is wh- when you say, you talk about someone's influence such as Coleman i would like to know what that influence is in purely musical terms and not simply, shared musicians the same thing for instance you mentioned Brubeck a number of times that he has acknowledged, Brubeck's    mhm right  right mhm mhm okay? Christoph um, now that you have, uh these extensive you know this volume of, liturgies that you've done recently, um, i'm just curious has, has he talked about his say his jazz training? and i mean we know he went to Berklee,  mhm mhm um, as for uh i'm, before i answer uh uh i'm just remembering um... um, Gary Bergman saying, y- you know Gary Bergman is wh- wh- whatever he is now Associate Dean or Dean of Curriculum i believe at the Berklee School of Music, and um, uh, you know i associate Berklee with uh with um, a heavy dose of transcriptions and, formulaic approaches uh to to scalar material and, you know uh uh, at CAL Arts we used to call it, uh the jazz factory you know and and and of setting CAL Arts from that, a little bit. but um, uh, however that is it's interesting that uh, that um, Gary Bergman said that he never transcribed a single solo and he never, uh uh, encourages anyone to, transcribe a solo. uh yeah but what do Deans have to say about the curriculum? well anyway, the the point that i'm, um making uh there is that um, uh, that th- th- this issue of uh how, how do you learn jazz um, is- is obviously, controversial even among those that, teach it, as as you, know, best of all. but um, uh, uh he always talked about his jazz learning uh with me as a as simply having been um playing, playing with uh with performers playing i mean obviously the the experiences with, uh Charles Lloyd and and uh Miles mhm hm yeah except yeah yeah, i- it's just interesting because, y- uh we know he studied classical music  so what  how old was he? uh, um wait Blakey was um, sixty, five so he was twenty. i think he may have started sixty-four so, that would've been nineteen. he was nineteen when he played  so just out of, just when he just quit with Berklee or did he? yeah uh Berklee was uh sixty-two sixty-three. so he was like seventeen or eighteen when    i bet you that the problem is academic year versus calendar year we think of, calendar years and liner note writers think of aca- uh we think of  mhm, yeah because you know he s- he so comfortable, playing, you know i- in pl- it sounds like he didn't play standards for a while and then, just moving into that i mean it's really, i mean kind of going back to Bob's point like the i mean- if i were to say this is just mind-blowing you know like the the the right   mhm mhm  well it's finding another pot to put the ingredients  yeah   yes, he said you know i've i've b- i would have to name him too, Borge's funnier so  i think there should be at least a chapter on  back to the drawing board so, um can i, one more yeah i'm sorry i interrupted you no that's alright um, so i wonder if maybe we could s- shift a little bit to something a little bit more open uh, could you talk a little bit about, how this dissertation might be a spring board for, some other areas that, you're gonna pursue, either related to J- Jarrett or not possibly mhm mhm mhm... wow, that's an interesting question um, y- you know i me- i mean of- th- the first thing that comes to my mind is this may be, a little off the wall but the first thing that comes to mind is um, this has done a lot for me as a musician and and but i haven't had the time, to actually be a musician uh uh so so i'm looking forward to how this will transpire in my, practice and in my, my playing. this, really doesn't have much to do with, the academic part but the musician was sort of on hold for a year and, and uh i- uh bu- in a good way i think that it it can do a lot of, of that um, uh w- w- what i what i've, learned is uh in in closer detail or one of the things i've learned, in closer detail to understand how this uh collage is woven together, you know um, what are the mechanics of uh, say moving from that My Funny Valentine introduction to um, to the soloing that then ensues over the over the chord changes. and one of the things that really were surprising to me is after i had made the transcription is, the predominance of that uh, diatonic uh uh of the diatonic uh material in other words staying within the C minor scale for, you know, almost half the performance uh uh, and yet it soun- it doesn't sound like that the melody notes are s- are are like that but what's going on is is highly chromatic underneath it. and um, that was something that i didn't understand just, by putting on a record and listening to it it's i i needed to see this and i needed to go wow there are, what, three hundred measures were all he's doing in his right hand is a C minor scale, and when i first came t- to jazz i, you know one of the things that attracted me is the, the the possibility of being more chromatic and, and less, tonal. so um understanding the mechanics of of that kind of improvisation and how he creates um, a longer arch of suspension or l- longer energy curve, that isn't really contained in clearly separable, um, uh, sixteen or thirty-two bar, choruses, um, was really interesting for me to find that out through research and i think it's, it's gonna end up, sounding, as well. in terms of uh a research project, i think um what i'd like to do is uh, possibly go to some other musicians and see um, see how, similar issues are handled, not in order to see whether they're doing the same thing and if they're not doing the same thing then it's not as good but, but i think that these issues uh impact any improviser, uh uh, an- and that was the launching point for my comparison with um of the solo concerts with Indian music is that there is a need, in in vernaculars uh predominantly improvised, uh to deal with form in a in a, in a creative manner and um, and one obvious solution uh for form in in uh, improvised music um, is cycles such as in Indian music, uh, and uh, in in his since he doesn't deal with that theory uh ye- you know on a on a conscious and in a strict stylistic manner, uh one of his solutions is uh uh s- s- this internalized sense of, of timing mhm mhm i, um, i'll be brief cuz uh, we're really kind of out of out of time so mhm mhm mm mhm mhm. well, i uh i think what it means, in particular uh, with respect to Jarrett is that uh, he loves Indian music he listened to it, he started the solo concerts at a time that was, very much under the, the star oh well then you're sticking to this tradition that it's a borrowing. uh       so that's the only innate thing is that need to somehow   mhm okay right well, that's that's yeah uhuh uhuh  yeah because that that is wh- what uh, both what some people so like and what's aggravates some people so much is this endlessness of these yeah    uh uh, well, you're saying there aren't_ there wouldn't be anybody else to look at. to make your case stronger. f- f- uh, for that particular   right right mhm i, i don't i don't care if (xx) analysis, it just struck me that, that uh mhm yeah th- uh i guess that is  yeah    mhm mhm i think that's true  mhm mhm right right, so to to acknowledge that more  bring it out mhm (xx) Stanley Crouch that, was that, or that's it. that was it.   you want ice cream? yeah, you want something more ritualistic? no i just, i haven't been through this before so you didn't know. no that's all.  those are the, (xx) i brought the wrong version      i just wanna know whose is whose well  okay uh well i didn't put mine, but i_  he can tell my  okay so that's mine. (gotcha.) there's one other thing here, just a  yes i do okay  great. please do. (up) here? yeah. that's fine. thank you. thank you. alright (you have a good move) thank you. i know, that's coming up soon. thanks for coming  sure, (xx) (xx) thank you for coming sure, it was fun i have to get you my copy because i ha- i have the uh the previous v- i picked up the  ah it's the cat's fault. great. when you indent and single space you do not need to use quotation marks. i see. so all those are  and make sure you, make sure you use double quotation marks (when you_) cuz in in in the first draft  right right i've tried to a- 	1

Robert. do you guys_ during the presentation this is part of your participation grade. if you come to class and read, it's considered (xx) so they're getting ready they're not ready yet, but if you guys saw the web page, if you guys have any questions about the web page how did they do that is my question. how did they do that? uh Bruce, uh can you please Morgan? how did you do that? the web page. um how'd you get the pictures on it? you get the pictures from like different, sources and you, paste 'em into a, web page.  what's that? your picture. oh we used a digital camera, for that, and then just, imported 'em like any other graph. it was well done. what what uh as i mentioned in class, it's not for instance the emailing. your participation is, how much you contribute it's not how often it's how much it's the content. it's what you're really contributing to the class as a whole. the same for the emailing it's the qualities it's not the quantity, of, the your, email participation. so if you, uh he will talk about, i if you have any further questions regarding, the technical aspects of it, you can ask now. Vara did you read our, did you read our, emails? yeah. yeah. oh. all of 'em? yeah. and sometimes i'd  i remember i like someone, wrote like you're probably gonna delete this who wrote that? me. Kelly. i'm sure half of you will delete this before reading it, but i just wanted to say that i (xx yesterday with a tear in my eye) well didn't we, learn in like one of the videos like, um T-V is just universal down there, like everyone has one and it's just like all linked together? and so that's how like, people even in the deepest regions can stay in contact. it was part of a government, um campaign it was party of the government, plot or, goals, to unite the country. what they wanted were was to have, every single citizen or as many as possible even in the jungle, to have access to T-V, and that was how they spread their, propaganda. it was during the dictatorship. they worked in partnership with Globo which is considered the fourth, largest T-V network in the world. and, the government wanted to show the P-S-As and, documentaries and, T-V ads etcetera, and even soap operas. they were all part of the, uh government plan, to, introduce information that it would benefit the, um government goals and plans. that's why even in the jungle when they didn't have, electricity the government would provide electricity, and buy even if only one T-V set and put in the center of the square and people would come in the evenings and watch T-V. maybe some of you who've had Kottak's anthropology class have heard about that? i remember someone early in the semester men- me- mentioning anthropology. but um, the T-V had a, very, i- it was, it was part of the government's, um plan, to communicate so brought T-V even to Indian villages etcetera. if you guys, are ready is it working Bruce? oh yeah. it's yeah. okay, so we are ready. do we, do we need to turn off the light?  i don't know. let's see how it projects.    i beg your pardon can we see with the lights on? i think if the door was open it will give enough light (xx) okay pull up to see from (xx) try the lights to see uh, please. oh wow. it's better, but i don't know... perfect alright. um what's this girl?  ooh yeah. that's great. i like to know if they saw those before class. and, in the central paragraph it just explains briefly um, just the types of uh, categories we're gonna, talk about so, that's about it. and uh, i i kinda wanna stay away from this cuz i may be wrong but, Bruce's gonna talk about police brutality, Carol's gonna talk about um, kinda the political, aspects, of Brazil, i'm gonna talk about health care issues in Brazil, and Anita, is going to talk about human rights alright. uh... okay um i'm going to talk about the the political, um corruption, that happens in Brazil, and relate it to the, the stor- history, of corruption. um, here i also give information on the, three main political parties, and, the Workers' party um, has been known to be the the least corrupt. mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm very good. we'll wait and have uh, ask questions at the end so who is next now Anita Robert? Robert. okay. well, welcome to health care in Brazil. mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm, mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm   okay. um, i'm gonna talk about the Univers- okay d- first of all do you_ have any of you heard about the Universal Decala- Declaration of Human Rights? mhm you're welcome so if you guys, have, maybe we can turn on the light or open the windows and, um, who wants to ask first what kind of questions do you guys have? yes? Morgan? do you know what the number one, um country for AIDS is? i don't know. Africa. Africa? mhm and i think it's where it started right?   i don't know. (xx) third world nations. i just know (xx) Allison has a question. i have a question for Bruce was that like um, a real situation or did you make that  and where di- like where did you fi- did you find that like on the computer or something? on the net, yeah. that's like the most like hard thing like i've ever heard like there are lots of examples out   mhm mhm mhm uh, on the, the page where the speech is written there's a link to, where i got this from. oh really? okay yeah w- one of the things that i like about the page is that you can go back and just, uh, mhm i thought the page was really great and like the (why i like) mhm. thank you guys. any more questions?  um, no well, i think they did, later on, yeah, oh mhm were they found guilty?  mm Allison? i thought like um, when, Bruce said that about like how in America how like abortion has become cheaper now just because, it's, like with the_ there's not as m- like competition now like how like, if Brazil, legalized, abortion like then maybe it would be made cheaper for the people there and like more people could get it, so like why wouldn't they? like i don't understand like,  yeah the the, the whole thing about the patriarchal, politics, i i think it's, it's to the point like, you know i- like with part of the nineteen seventies, our politicians were, you know they did- they didn't expand their horizons to women's feelings. you know what i mean? so, it's just, they gotta think about the women first you know and they if it's_ if they if they're thinking about themselves they're not gonna, look into this whole  isn't uh, the reason that they're not, legalizing it is because it's a religious thing? mhm i don't know you guys wanna answer that? i guess that's right cuz it, it's mainly,  and we didn't even, it's still illegal and we didn't, even divorce, was considered, inappropriate and we didn't really have divorce until, in the eighties, and abortion is taboo. we are not even supposed to talk about it. so Betty but i feel like it would benefit their society. i know, i know. a lot of things as we saw in that, Capital Sins movie, is doesn't even make sense. it seems that there is a child running the country at times. so, Betty? well that's all i was gonna say, even if it was legalized, there's still like, a cultural, religious pressure like, people still like thank you Carol people still what? people still wouldn't have abortions. like i was just, agreeing with them well there's a- the- there there's gonna be a same amount of people, be- because there's already, a third of the possible, babies that could be born are, being killed. mhm  mhm, yeah? um, i agree i think abortion should be illegal but don't you also maybe think that, like you think it should be legal, or illegal? i think it should be illegal,   like a long time ago like the worst thing the worst thing that could happen was like you'd get pregnant like when my like when my mom was like, a te- like, a young adult like that was like the worst thing like you'd get pregnant but now like it goes beyond that it goes like, mhm mhm hm. yeah so basically um, the, one, that most people in Brazil the way they get AIDS is through blood transfusions? um twenty percent of all AIDS cases are, through blood transfusions, s- which is a lot, unfortunately. right, so it's not necessarily most, but it's a large percentage. i- is that the mo- that's the, most frequently (cause?) um twenty percent. yeah. oh. was it twenty percent, of AIDS cases, are from blood transfusions yep   mhm  mhm mhm. i have to ask you a question not, not regarding the, blood transfusion but, you said that l- and then like the all the rich people live in the south and like the all the good hospita- who was the one that was talking about that? me um, i mean i- i don't know for sure but i'd guess and, Vara you can tell me if i'm wrong but, i think y- everything is generally better in the sou- i talked to Darrell, you you guys remember Darrell  okay and yeah he's in my dorm he's actually my, he's two doors down from me, so we talked about  what's that? hm'm. oh cuz i saw w- i think i saw  they go around. they're normal people. (and?) um, and just that, basically everything in the south is better. you know? you're gonna have better hospitals, um there's more, money in the south especially in the state of Sao Paulo, mhm Sao    mhm. then, then that's the, well, i did e- we did education for our thing and so and that's like the best school so yeah i guess,  northeast they went to the northeast and what did we see in the northeast? poverty. factories and buildings? no, poverty dry land and, uh and despair. and that's typical. mhm i just wanna say that i thought your website was really good. i was very impressed when i, went on yesterday i was like wow. i didn't realize you could click on the pictures and all of a sudden i was like clicking and i was like oh my god (what) (xx) very good, very good job. an excellent job. it was (xx) so uh if you guys don't wanna make any, final comments i would like to introduce our guest. you guys done? okay so, what is her name who would like to, say, what her name is? anyone know?  is it Ana Lisa or something? Ana Lisa, mhm, Ana Lisa mhm no, um, just magazines. just magazines   the top business and the top uh, weekly magazine is Visao Visao. by far ho- what is the,   one million, uh, bless you.  the fourth largest weekly magazine one million. what did we see in the the documentaries what we've seen, throughout the semester, how, many people in Brazil can really actu- can actually read and write? a small percentage. one million for a cou- in a country of a hundred seventy million is a tremendous, uh task to accomplish, because of the high illiteracy rate. so it's basically a, a highly successful, publishing house, and, uh including her magazine. so i'll let her talk about her magazine, and a little bit and then she'll talk about herself, and then you guys will ask questions. um, what is the name of the magazine? uh uh i'm a senior editor for this magazine. i- i brought (xx) it's a um, it's like a magazine, just two years old and it's about career and professional development. it's a kind of magazine, it's, uh, tries to, to tell our readers h- that they need to improve, uh they need to study more, and, it's um, how can i say, right. hey, wake up. wake up. yeah. that's about the magazine and, we, i am very proud that, um, i am in the project s- since the beginning, because i worked for, Exame magazine the business magazine and, then Exame decide to launch this new magazine two years ago, and, it's a very, it's going very well, in Brazil. uh we are, we've almost three hundred thousand, uh issues per month. oh that's good,  yeah. uh, yes, because um, i- i was uh uh, i was working for Exame and i was writing for Exame this same kind of subject. mhm mhm mhm any questions i'm curious to know, what is she doing here? a senior editor a chief editor, of a high ranking business magazine in Brazil, what is she doing here did she travel just to visit us our class? or, fifteen minutes why are you here? um, uh as i i've written, uh for Voce the inte- international experience, is a good thing to, to have in your in your career. so, i decided that i needed have to, i need have one and then i applied for the Michigan Journalist Fellows, is a, a special program, uh that the, University of Michigan has. and it's, you have to apply for it, it's, twelve, uh, we we are twelve Americans journalists and six international journalists. every ye- year you have a different, journalist here. so we come here and we can, uh we can study whatever we want at the University. so some of us are at the medical school some of uh us are at the law school, i am at the business school. so, in the, it's almost done. i, i'm here since September and, uh it's going to finish now in April. do you like it here? here? i like it very much. i'd like to stay here for more two years. yeah? yeah i have to come back, yeah? i, i have to work. so, you, run the magazine still while you're here? no i i'm i'm uh, an employee a continuing uh uh an employee but i'm not working for the magazine. someone is, working my,  yeah yeah. do you know um, a magazine here that this is like, like, like? parallel to  similar, here in States? uh it's Fast Company, have you heard about? Fast Company?  hm it's slightly different from Forbes and ah because uh Fortune and Forbes, and Exame in Brazil, they talk about business, they talked about companies, and Voce and Fast Company talk about people, about, uh you and how, your dreams and your ambitions and, your education, so it's n- we don- we don't talk about, logistics or, investments. we talk about how can, how, can you improve your, your job or your company. um, Lisa, i had the pleasure to have her as a guest in my M-B-A class, this week? yeah  mhm they knew where it was, yeah. and one thing that you mentioned that, why have you been taking so many cla- i, i understand that um, the guest, the the calibre of the guest that's why i, i, mentioned to the class get the chance because we have a high-ranking executive, that we can ask any questions regarding the economy or maybe gender issues etcetera. and your colleagues at the Michigan Journalist Fellows, are people to give you an idea, from Wall Street Journal, um B-B-C, of uh London, um Washington yeah yeah yeah  can you please, um? um, first because i'm curious about, Master in Business Administration, because i've written many articles for Exame and then for Voce about, M-B-As and how, why s- a lot of Brazilians are taking so, are travelling abroad to to take an M-B-A. and uh i'm curious about, what- what does uh, Michig- uh, Business School does. so i came here, because i was curious and, secondly be- because i work for a business magazine and it's important to me, to know, what's going on, in business what is the, the newest, uh, (professional) or something like that trend or that's great. yeah um are there, executives, um that are men, i- for your magazine that work for your magazine? yeah. the the director, uh is a man. and a- what, if you don't mind me asking like what's the comparison of like, your wages? oh. their ages or my age?    the salary. oh. um... i think that the, guys, in the same age and the same level, uh, as i am, they earn more than me. so there is still the inequality. Anita? what about the number of women working in your area? as the men are there is it equal, the men? in journalism? yeah. in journalism are more, women than men. oh? they  would it be possible for you or like another woman to run the magazine, or would that not be like?  so it cou- it could be possible it's it could be possible mhm. um you mentioned and, in my other, in the language course i teach, we watch uh Globo (xx) showing uh women, and how much, the women's role has changed in in the last decade or so. and one of the the, one of the segments they show that many more women complete second grade than man, and their number is even higher, at the u- a- at the college level. so there are more women graduating from college than men. so, in in the future as you mentioned   yeah. um, i think the women are growing (xx) so um, gr- growing up, quickly. mhm. and compared to this country we see that i think only five percent of the C-E-Os, are women. so in the in the major,  mhm mhm  oh yeah. mhm. uh who is the owner of eBay? it's a woman. from the Bay City Area, in uh, in San Francisco. uh who runs, Hewlett Packard? a woman. if if we would start, paying attention an- we could_ the list would go on and on yes which is, what do you guys, what do you guys think are the implications of that? more women in power at least in the dot-com companies. what do you guys, what would you guess, one of the implications, would be? well obviously the computer's like of the future so, in the future the women, are gonna, i'm not gonna say take over but, they're gonna obviously have equal, and, there'll be equal amounts, of women in, in each company. i feel li- i feel like right now though like in, at least in the United States ev- they're equal. like they're looked at equally businesswise except there's not as many as them, because, because of the past but now, i don't know exactly how to put this but i don't know i just feel like this correlation as, business goes on, the women working will increase. mhm. and then, consequently i guess they would hire, more women and put more women in in, decision-making positions  some biggest companies, uh here in States, i- us in Brazil has, kind of rules that they have to have at least twenty or twenty-five percent  yeah  in this class? yeah. you, like, you Kelly. do you feel that, your classmates the male, um classmates do they treat you, or the professors do they treat you in the same way, that they treat the male,  yeah. there there is a tendency there there there is, some thought that perhaps at least in the the high school level, and we still have, uh, uh Ver- what is the name Versar? we- we have so many, colleges that are female only and that is- Vassar? is that the r-  mhm. right. uh, and in high school they feel that if it is, uh, not a coed but if it is a women only class, and the entire school, the girls will achieve and they will perform better and they will, get higher grades in tests etcetera. because some girls, particularly in high school, they feel, a bit, not that they feel harassed but, they, they feel that um, the presence of the guys, will no- not permit them, to participate as much. they are, reluctant to raise their hands and say that they didn't understand and ask the teacher to, explain again, uh a subject matter. so there are some people that believe in that, and they go even to the college. what do you guys think would be, the the consequences of that? when we, you mentioned your boss being a man. so is there a place is there a country is there a city or a company, that, is exclusively for, females or males? or in the real world, we are gonna be hired and have male and female colleagues... what is your question? no i was gonna say that, i think a lot of times guy teachers are nicer to girls. the guys turn? the guy professors, mhm definitely. are nicer? yeah, definitely. they treat the girls better yeah even the girl           (xx)  it has changed a lot. and i don't think gender plays a role in, getting jobs either. mhm.   and what would be the reasons why is that? is that because he's got a family  drink beers together. uh s- so  mhm the old boys' club, here in the state of Michigan a woman, actually sued a country club a golf club, that wouldn't allow her, as a member    there's a golf club, like, in New York, that women can't join. only men. like single     baloney i swear to God ours isn't.    i beg your pardon? there are many days throughout the week, that oh, yeah yeah. and they have a certain, for each day that they can play it's certain times that they can play. so they try to accommodate. so, wh- what happens in Brazil i fear, wh- you you say Lisa. Lisa. i think it's pretty commo- common that uh, the guys go out and then they became friends or something like that and, so... they are remembered, before the the the women.     the Indians the Indians. the native Brazilians. so i compare to the the time, to the frontier, to to the to the time a hundred years ago, when people were moving west. uhuh  mhm. and we've watched many documentaries and they were, amazed. i started showing them, a little bit of the bleak the the, i- i think Brazil has changed a lot, and, uh, we, we are improving our situation. in the, i think the last ten years, mhm but things are improving and i think that's the idea, that the class, towards, now that we are towards the end of the semester, we are coming to conclude that, it's not that bad. there's a lot of horrible things happening, but people are trying,  the top university. (federal) school yeah. (federal) university and, it's very good and my four sisters, three sisters and uh one brother also went, studied there and, so. it's- it's possible that you, change your, your, poor destiny like that. mhm and there's a lot of hope. yeah um, i was, how you were saying you know about the, Brazilian cinema thing mhm there is one very good Randall Johnson. okay yeah.  there, there are about two good ones. right. you put- what wa- do you remember the other guys's name? i don't remember.      i i think that's a (xx) okay. Robert? thanks a lot. you're welcome. you got my email? about the (weird evidence?) yeah it's alright. okay. okay. okay. alright. also um, you know how you said you sent an email, about, the announcement (xx) yeah (xx) yeah that's not um yeah i thought it was because we were skipping so i thought we'd,  okay. i underst- no no, that's fine. i saw one of those too. should i do  okay. thank you so much Carol  good. could you also send us the reservation for this please on the web? cuz we we still need to be keeping track. and that would also help us with the so that you know who has been writing (xx) well yeah for the that (personnel) (xx) and the class is like (xx) (xx) right, okay yeah. okay, real good. yeah if you could just send us one of those forms that would be great. okay i will do that. is that okay if i do it tomorrow not today? yep.   are all three of you first-year students? yes cuz i, couldn't, do  (xx) yeah we, we (xx) yeah she already put one there but i'll do this one here. i need to do it right now? is that what it is? i can give you (xx) do you guys have a question? should we email you? email me, about  and uh at some point, could you change that name, Carnival? in the A-F-S base? i already did  oh thank you very much. yeah. alright bye 	1

TOU999MX062.json	if everyone's here, um, my name is Dale Jerome, and i'm a volunteer docent, is the word we use here, but it really means tour guide, i i have a question yes you said if the second floor was dedicated to the art  i assume it was alumni offices. uh, it was office space and, i- i don't know, exactly what was in the office space but since it's called Alumni Memorial Hall, oh okay Garden of Eden. okay, the Garden of Eden... now that's more of a, a concept but of course we're looking, at a t- fruit tree here of some sort, um, a figure. this, animal coiled around here and it's all taking place, in a l- in a garden. anything that i've missed? how do we know it's a garden? there's plants. yeah. there are plants. um, anything else i may have missed? the fruit tree? the fruit tree,  the water. the water. if you look way beyond, what is the land here, you'll see that these hues of blue these uh these shades of blue, vary a little bit in the background, and if you look very closely, you'll see fingers of green or brown that come out into that blue, which i interpret as land, um you you may not you may have some other ideas and i'd like to hear that... so_ and then we have a river of course, um that's coming through the garden, and so uh i think that we can fairly say that this is, then a river a body of wat- a, lake or ocean or whatever, that um, is the- this river empties into. well then let's think about, what, signs how has, the artist used for instance um, color or space or, um, i- the way he's drawn the forms, what things give you the idea that this is the Garden of Edian- Eden? or is it the arrangement of things any ideas?   yeah okay we're yeah. and these are all very familiar, to us of a Western European tradition, or Christian tradition, we recognize those immediately. now we'll see a piece later in the tour, from the Senufo culture in Africa, where we can't really touch, the iconography that we see. um, but here it's very familiar to us. you see the snake, and my s- the snake is, the most favorite part for me because he looks so evil, in these Renaissance, with these, you know bar- well he doesn't have barred teeth he's looking rather chagrined i guess here at Eve. innocent. yeah curious. curious, innocent. and she's not, totally aware of what she's buying into here, it doesn't look like. um, she has these long flowing curls and it has been said that, such figures as these may be the prototypes for, or come from the pictures of the Virgin that would follow, though uh if you_ there're lots of pictures of the Virgin in here, and if you look around you will see that you don't often see the Virgin, s- shown with long flowing hair it's usually covered by a, habit-looking cloak. um, you can see that the artist has, tried to give you some idea of spatial recession. now this isn't very sophisticated. uh, because it took us a long time to find the ocean and the water right? do you know anything about the choice of, the frame in the picture?   who conserv- who_ do you have conservationists here that_ (i don't-) actually this_ we send most of our things to Oberlin College we don't have_ um actually i shouldn't say that. in the_ in Asian art, we have one of the foremost conservation laboratories in the nation, um but, i think that most of the oils have gone, to Oberlin if i'm not mistaken i know that large one over there did. when you were talking about conservation earlier you ment- something mentioned something about ultraviolet mhm they can put_ i think it's ultraviolet i'm almost positive it's ultraviolet they put it under a light and they're able to see, the sketches or the underpainting, of whatever was done, if the artist uh painted out something. uh, and there're very few pieces that, a museum would own, where you have the backup sketches so it's sort of neat to be able to see how the thing developed, and, if our s- supposition is right and they did paint, these brambles in later, it's sort of interesting to think well, why was this so important? flowers. flowers. okay and here we see flowers... anything else maybe lots of trees and animals trees, animals, so lots of,  something secluded like, nature in the raw or something  is that the shrinkwrap? uh, shrinkwrap. it isn't shrinkwrap it might, sorta look like it though. i'm not sure how i feel about this because this is an installation which is, sort of a new, new type of art that, different media allows us to use we're no longer confor- fined to painting within a frame, feel free to walk around it, you're meant to walk around it and get different views of it... h- how do you define an installation? what do you_ what does it exactly mean? well it- an installation is an, art piece it doesn't necessarily have to be three-dimensional but it's made for a specific, site. oh are these all sculpted? well, um, these are not, sculpted. this is a very interesting process, and i think it really, um shows, how, broadening, possibilities as far as media is concerned, uh has broadened the possibilities for art. can you all hear me? okay. um, what Miss Ferrari did, was, use, fetal pigs, as um they come in a box and they're called, piglets it is labelled, and um so she's used these, to make, the castings from, she used a resin, and plaster casting, from a latex mold and the latex, evidently mold allows one to capture great detail. um the snakes, oddly enough, came from a tax- taxidermist. and evidently i didn't realize this people bring in their snakes to have mounted as trophies and so they take the skin off it, a- and then put another, you know substance inside. and so she's working in the same way she could get these snake skins, from uh the taxidermist and then, proceeded from there but again, using this um, latex material, f- to make the mold, and therefore capturing such detail. um, well what ideas do you get from this? she's called this piece Garden... what are some, any of you, offer, how do you feel about looking at it is there any message that... why do you think she might have called it Garden?... irony? irony? okay. can you, expand that a little bit? well because it doesn't seem to be, a collection of things that have been fostered for life it seems like a collection of things that have been killed. okay. let- i'm gonna repeat that just so you_ did you all hear that? no okay. uh it was pointed out, that it doesn't look as if these things, have been, nurtured for life but rather that they're in a, that they've been killed that they're in a dead state. so that irony. any other, ideas that come to mind? a snake might eat a piglet. okay. that's one idea. um, let me tell it to you a little bit from the point of view of the artist. i hav- i have to ask you not to touch it unfortunately. though, i think that this is very very tactile i mean i wanna just slide over the top of it. i don't. um, the, i had a chance actually i was very fortunate to talk to the artist, who's from Detroit, um for about a half an hour day before yesterday, and um, she sees this as being quite a benign thing, and called it Garden, because, she sees sort of this as being the beginning of life, sort of the haphazard arrangement, that might be attached to sort of the, um, primordial mess th- out of which came life, and she also looks at it as, death so she she se- seeing seeing things more as the life cycle here. um... how does she come to this? well what about the color. what does the color, mean to you. flesh. flesh. okay. is it healthy flesh or, dead flesh or young healthy flesh. young healthy flesh. mhm. um, she painted can you imagine, each one of these with a high gloss paint individually she also, cast each one of these individually so, uh you can imagine that this was, there's lots of little dead piglets lying around. what makes you think they're dead? they look dead. why do they look dead? i'm gonna push you a little bit they're lying around they're just lying around. they're just lying around. there's no mother.  um there's so many of them. there's so many of them. so it doesn't, they s- do they seem lifeless? they're sleeping they're lying around they don't look sleeping it looks like a dumping ground for little piglets. now... she would dispute this. that, death is what, o- one carries away from this. she sees a lot more life attached to this. a quite even balance between life and death. and, part of it she pointed out was the color, um, but that these are piglets sleeping she's not slashed them open in any way she's not damaged them in any way. and, in addition, you know the label on the box says piglets it doesn't say dead pigs sort of thing. i think it's the ears.  they  jellied piglets. it could be, that you and i who have all dissected piglets, bring this association. she claims that when small children who don't have this association at all, have seen it, they're looking at more as if the pigs are sleeping on each other there's a lot more feeling of, connectedness, to this. and sort of, well i don't know whether the right word is community but, living together in harmony, sort of thing. what about the snakes though, yeah  the snakes are, alive. the snakes are alive. right and and i guess you could say that that's part of this life process two different stages that she's showing here. um, and i don't know maybe we could say then there is, maybe that's what gives me the idea, me personally that there is some sort of competition between the snake and the piglet and, one's, preying upon the other or whatever... um, we_ well what gives you the idea of, death here? wha- visually what what, what techniques has she used to, show the end of life? or maybe we've already gone on, ni- into that. none of the pigs have their heads raised in contrast to the snakes and, even though they're surrounded by, snakes which potentially could be predators they're not, not a single one of the thousands of pigs, here is,  yeah right, okay. they're pretty limp looking. yeah they're sort of, flaccid and so, the p- snakes i think, many are saying have a lot more animation to them than the pigs do that are just sort of, lying there limp. one of you mentioned the number of things, and, this you can see she's repeated, the snake and the pig motif over and over and over again. now there're two things that we could think about that repetition does. one is, it sort of, vivifies, the, message. i mean if you see um... a mass grave...   that was the first thing i thought of. i mean it seems sort of sad if she, has created something that evokes such a strong association and reaction in people that is exactly, not what she wanted. well, she may wanna work with this piece more. um, she did point out to me, and i think this is very true, that oftentimes we look for art always to be uplifting, and as if that were the artistic tradition when in reality they were doing things, such as Eve in there with these horrible little demons who were making saints be, dying and so there's a lotta horror in, Medieval and Renaissance, art that we sort of, forget about in the, getting the truth and beauty end of things. so um, there is a tradition for this. so what again was it that she_ that besides the color, that, evokes life for her? i think she's just looking at the sort of, disorder there's a lot of movement in here i think maybe you could say, um... that this is sort of the beginning of life. hm' are the pieces that_ on there are they attached, to you know i don't know that. i don't know that. it comes down in about a day so. either she's gonna go out with a lotta boxes like the art fair, it looks like this is panelled. this is i think some sort of, i w- used to think it's Styrofoam but i think it's some sort of fiberboard. hm. um, i have a couple of other things to show you upstairs. if y- i see that we have, one woman, pregnant so maybe you'd like a chair  if you_ we don't have chairs per se but we do have some stools over there which are portable if you want to pick one up as we go upstairs feel free to do so. and, uh we're going up to the head of the stairs here if you wanna follow me. how's our time going? thirty-six minutes... i'm notorious for, i haven't been up here in a long time. maybe we should stop here and i should go back to sort of just orienting people as to where they are.  would you say uh these figures are bisexual? because um it is what? a bisexual figure. um, because you said the horn is a, male   um, this figure is the male. now evidently they, they usually sh- show, the male and female together yeah mhm mhm is there anything, extraordinary about this in terms of abstraction? i mean isn't it, sort of surprising the, the way it's done, just artistically? well... i think that, two things come to my mind. one is that most of these pieces are made out of a single piece of wood. so when you think of the medium, and you think of all the possibilities for instance, with latex molds that, Ferrari had downstairs, and then you think of a th- single piece of wood and rather woo- rude carving materials, that puts considerable constraints on what you see. um, as far as finishing the wood, um, a lot of that is done with natural finishes and just use actually. um but it's very well balanced i mean there's, tha- i'm sure these people have fingers and there's no, there's no hands and, i mean it's it's linear it's a lot like um, i mean, a lot of modern painters, you know (xx)  it could be an entrance or an exit. okay... the frame (of the first two) kind of (xx) okay, that's another, uh, good deduction to make that i hadn't thought of. are there any, other, of_ others of you who see relationships with the things we, saw before?... i'm just thinking of the door that we_ i mean this obviously doesn't have a door but it definitely, is_ or i shouldn't say definitely is_ to me, it is an entrance. what makes you think that? what visually, makes you, think of that. let's s- sort of take it apart... the space in the middle. (xx) okay. there's a void in the middle and a very intentional void. so it really now, becomes a part of the design. and this is different, from earlier sculpture you would've seen. um, if you go downstairs and i think they're still where they used to be, look at the neoclassical, uh two marble sculptures on either side of that central presitio- partition as you come in. there aren't very many voids there, you're more focused as you're looking at it, on the woman, whose dress is being blown by the wind and leaning over with her staff etcetera etcetera. you're not looking at the voids to tell you part of the story. and here you have to. this is more and more, usual i think, as um, you, you come up into the Modern Era Contemporary Era of art. um... and i won't go into it deeply here but if_ i was trying to think of other pieces in this room that might, beg for this sort of analysis the one right behind you i think does, which doesn't say much, just on a two-dimensional, basis, but, if you think of voids and, the relationship of spaces there, i think you'll find that it's quite rich. also with the Giacometti sculpture over here, um, though it's quite dense, in terms of material because of its shape, this very long thin elongated shape, you sort of need to see this, space around it. um in order to get the full impact of it and the Hepworth back there is another way of looking at things i'll get into too much of that but, i think that that's a fun way, to to look at art in a gallery is to take an idea like that, and then look at how artists are playing with that. so, we've talked about the voids and the, positive spaces here. what else makes you think it is a, entrance exit? well the curves up above the lintel the, the one that's farthest from you is, seems to be the most, massive or it, it could imply that it's attached to the mass mhm mhm. is there an architectural form it reminds you of? an arch an arch, right. and um, well i guess it's on here, Arch Margarita this is a whole series that she did and i was tempted to bring you pieces of other, things in the series so you could see, how she changed each, piece a little bit. but one of the ways it was, is in the lintel, and some of it is, some of the pieces are quite a bit heavier, up here on top, than this is. this seems to be very graceful to me at the top in fact that's why i love it. there's such a lightness, to those lines up there, even though they are, you know, well this one is rather, thin but otherwise you've got, you know you've got a big, expanse of bronze there. so we have the, lintel and post construction of a door, and um, very reminiscent of the arch, and i i'm sure that many of you read here on the label that that's actually what she was getting, um her, her uh inspiration from is some, ruins in Greece of Greek architecture. Linberg um, i've had the pleasure and, honor of meeting her a couple of times, and um, a very personable woman, um, but she lives in Detroit has her studio i believe in Bloomfield Hills and she sho- she has a gallery in, Birmingham and also in New York. she's included in a lot of collections, um, often, she, seems to take this architectural, uh approach to things, and she's made another series, which is a series of columns that are_ that have sort of f- very, simple, figures, but elegant, female figures embedded in them, that are, very solid so that it gives one the impression, that a w- a woman is standing there almost as a column. the facial expressions are so simplified as to resemble in many ways the Senufo that we just, saw. so, i think it's interesting, that architecture, is her inspiration so much. probably another good reason why i like it so much cuz i like architecture. um   exactly. and this is where it all came from. i mean the, welded seams, everything, i i think the technique on this is just impeccable to me. and the other thing i think is interesting is what it does with shadows. yeah oh wow um, i would love to have this piece in my house. mhm mhm thank you. so is everything in the museum right now, in the collection or there are_ is there a tra- there are, travelling exhibits right now or   it's part of the permanent collection? yeah. and they just sort of rotate stuff? yeah because the collection is_ i don't know exactly how many pieces but it's quite, extensive. wow.  it's such a great painting. and we have a lot of very good Picasso prints. so we we have a fairly good overall, look at his, mhm that's pretty abstract. yeah. but, see now you could even look at the Joanie Mitchell over there as a garden. that was an imagined landscape for her, hm'  yep. hm'   thanks. thank you. okay. thanks again. 	1
LES175SU079.json	 so what did you think of Kimberly's email about my uh the_  the one from Kimberly about uh, oh we're gonna do our own thing you guys can go out and do your own thing  Michelle right hm' (i mean) you tell me. i mean the uh  did you look (xx) um, well why don't we sort of, i mean Kim wants BLAST everything against everything, some of this is being done in MAGPIE for the first fifty or so by tomorrow morning, so what i'm doing is i'm BLASTing all the MAGPIE ORFs against the caulobacters so actually it's fa- FastAing so that if MAGPIE called exactly the same ORF as, TIGR did, then it'll show up in that evidence section as a one hundred percent homology right there. and is it, so is it from X to X? so what's really worrying me is what TIGR's supposed to have sent us was linear sequence yeah yeah,  they did screw yeah you know   right   it doesn't look like complete contig but it looks like big regions of the specific contigs are the junctions between that's clear that they don't  right it's never worse than two? never, i've never s- i haven't seen it worse than two, but i only have data on the first twenty um, groups by this morning so, okay how long till you get the rest of the genomes in (egg form?) i have the first fifty groups BLAST-ED, BLAST-N BLAST-PED, um, (right) (okay) before i go okay  when are you leaving exactly? um, i've got a flight Saturday but i don't know what time okay so yeah, no the weekend will be when when the majority of the rest of the BLASTing gets done. okay, we can um, we'll do something. but you know, we can get the first seventy but i'm wondering if this is why when when Yermin sent me back (and he said) you know we've got all these transporters. is it that they're duplicates? you know he says that (call factors discussed in these) (xx) transporters and things like that maybe,  okay i need to teach. i'm being a really bad example here. i can tell you're all gonna be quiet all day long bad day  no okay he's on his own. okay or after eleven-thirty at night. yeah   is Wednesday the only day we could do it? hm? well the problem is i'm out of town, i don't get back in town until Tuesday, late, (xx) yes mhm i have class till ten though, seven till ten. uhuh i won't do it at ten. no what time on Tuesday? yeah, how late?  could we do it a little earlier like,  i missed it cuz i was writing, but four features of the first open reading frame or the promoter? four features of a promoter i have a question  there's yeah isn't that weird? it's math that doesn't work right. i so it, the minus-ten region, is that what we call TATA box? so, this is the TATA box. okay, does the second one ha- that  okay right, that's why mhm okay  i don't know if it's the same_ it certainly is not the same protein D-N-A interaction. so the protein that interacts and identifies these sequences in bacterial D-N-A po- R-N-A polymerase are not the same as eukaryotic R-N-A polymerase, okay okay okay okay basal just means, below the level that you can regulate it then. um basal is sort of the level that it's it's it's at before you regulate it. so, a basal level of transcription might be, um again i- it's a term that's like phenotype. it's gonna depend upon, the state tha- which you're referring it to. okay? a basal level of transcription for a ribosomal protein, when you're in exponential phase, is very different than, the basal level, when the cells are growing very slowly but you can still call them basal because you wanna refer it to something else that happens. mhm is co-factor okay in this case, to call it? um it would be if it wasn't a genetic term. um, th- this is y- you're well immersed in fifty years of genetics terminology and so, you cannot call tryptophan a co-factor in this case. had you done these studies in the nineteen nineties you'd probably call it a co-factor. um,  okay.   uhuh  okay it's, sure i'll repeat it, okay kay okay oh okay  yes yes,  i gotta go to that seminar. which seminar? the one (over at) the biochemistry seminar. whose? um, i don't know. the fly guy? yeah yeah, i gotta go i know, four days, i'm absolutely freaked out about this. can we meet, tomorrow at some point?  yeah, i'm in by seven. so so i wonder if we can get him to meet us at, meet us at nine, i don't think i have my first appointment till ten or ten-thirty. okay  yeah but i really hafta go to that seminar. alright... so the exam is next Thursday? yeah. okay. that's better. okay. oh okay. yeah, and if you come upstairs i'll give it to you and there's somebody else that wanted 'em too. yeah, i forgot to bring 'em. okay i was just gonna ask you one more little thing hi i was just showing the little short   no  okay okay 	1
LAB200JU018.json	yeah so there's no i have no idea who's doing five then? (you) doing four? huh? you doing four? yeah (xx) just started on it. that's a pretty (xx) we're stuck at the end (yeah it's orange juice) what is it? (xx) (xx) lead bromate just have to be pretty much uh, (xx) (replace) (xx) i think i saw your roommate. is he a large (xx) tall? kind of (xx) uh he's he's kinda tall is he built like you a little? uh (xx) yeah uh (xx) oh really? yeah (oh here we got started bad) what had happened was that we were getting no reaction. (S-M-L) (xx) (maybe) in the computer room yeah. no reaction. we got, what we found, is that uh, when you mix, the, sodium hydroxide and (xx) you get a white precipitate, and then just, we were just like (fixing the) (xx) and so we found we got white precipitate but then we add, the potassium (chromium) to it, the white precipitate (xx) so we_ we're guessing that uh the white precipitate (xx) what am i doing? i don't know. God only knows. like, is our liquid clear or is, our liquid's clear. so i guess it kinda has to be (thick) well let's filter it, (okay?) all all of these reactions are (you going) on four now? halfway the first step is you get a (queue) (xx) yep. what we're what we're guessing is that like (xx) is uh better (xx) okay? yeah excuse me i'm done with mine so if you, want some help, i mean well i don't have anything to do um, is it right?   okay um, well, you can, you can did you ask is Shannon done? yea- no he's not but he's all confused and he's like, stressed out on (it.) aah, you could kinda chill i guess. and then (xx) (potassium bromate) and then when you (put it) all together you (have) (xx) result (xx) put together and got sixty percent (xx)     C-S-O-four plus S-N (C-O) that should be a precipitate oh man. okay, (you're) doing (work, right?) here's your uh, reagent sheet. with all the reagents  alright, so add N-H-three to the end result? what? so add N-H-three, t-  hey, (Ani, Ani) fuck you test tube do you have any test tubes (left here?) uh, i think so. so, we're filtering we're filtering out our precipitate see the results (xx) yeah. so this is the same as this. right?   (xx) these in cold water hot_ we have to put it in, we have to put our solid in the hot water. wait. that, (if that's) (xx) soluble right, so it's not it so right now it's a solid. like right now we have precipitate cuz our water's cold. i've got five molar.   (cold?) (xx) so, um you're saying that you saw purple with the hexate right? (yeah we did) (xx) so. okay no you (had to be)  i'm tired of counting to forty. alright if we've got five molar, how many drops do we add? (xx) five what? isn't chromate C-R-two?  no i guess not (xx) gonna be  (we want) if we heat up the original, the original like, solution, (xx) (xx) cuz one was  what are you guys doing with hot water and stuff? trying to get out a precipitate ohh. i hope i don't have to go through all that. you finished um, you finished both of yours already? this is the second one. (xx) this is so not working (xx) oh okay i'm bored outta my mind. well go home. what? what? you don't have anything else to do right? but i'm supposed to help, i'm supposed to help you guys right? you can,  so wait. let's... (xx) man we shoulda done it by section that's what i was seriously about to say (we're) trying to find each (autograph) cuz from here you can (in there) (xx) how do we get the hot water?  there's a hot water tap (xx) what's the charge on um sulf- sulfate? i don't know S-O-four minus two. how do you get hot water? how do you get hot water? (xx) okay. thank you. i (xx) eight has  what did you just do? did it work? well look it's basically all in the test tube anyway as long as the water's clean it doesn't matter... right? hey is this water really hot? no i don't know well it's a little warm that water gets hot (xx) alright so what were they saying? they were saying that they told me it was a better Lewis base than than N-A-O-H? yeah okay. but they didn't test that, and i think th- we didn't either i don't know if we do because we know, we know what the product is. okay. true. so i'm not sure if we need to know_ we need to um no there's (xx) try it. fuck it. let's kill this bitch. does it really? okay hey you don't have to do that, actually. sorry. but i gave you something to do. are you sure it gets it hot_ it gets hot enough? i mean. it probably doesn't get hot enough (xx) (what was that?) it doesn't get hot enough. well we've gotta let it run for a minute into the nitrate if you want to set it up we can oh yeah.  it gets (a little bit) cloudy. you're touching nonpotable water miss Catie S  what are you doing? i just wonder what that is oops hm boy. (xx) (compulsory) for the hypothesis as to the (xx) okay um, hypothesis (xx) this is not hot. okay you were right so this doesn't heat up, but (this isn't good) (it does) (xx) we're heating it up turning it on high man do you need your pipettes anymore Catie?   yeah.  not cold cold but it's not warm. okay it's getting warm. okay you're right it's getting warm. oh that feels kinda good. hey (xx) spilling (xx) do you have water? no not good not good. (so) (xx) this has gotta go that was probably not a good idea was it? okay i'm gonna add hot water to  what? what? you know the F-E-two reaction?   no no they're getting precipitates no it's the water it's the water it might be the water it's the b- (xx) water (xx) yeah but. if your water's too basic, you're gonna get a precipitate. (xx) the number one reaction   if they're using (boxed) water, (that's why.) cuz the (boxed) water's basic. tell them to use tap water. Henry, what'd you say two meant? D decomposes hey Richard, it doesn't (clear it up) did you use the right (copper?) yeah forty-one? yeah you use the same amount hey (i want) hot water okay we heat up the water. you are stupid, why did you touch it? don't do anything yet. okay why? cuz it says here that, (xx) nitrate, yeah? oh. oh, man. it said like (xx) so do i need this? i don't know. well check  hey check what happens to the copper fluoride in hot water. so, how are you, how are you doing_ you getting the f- the the precipitate, and then,  so, if that's the case it should, disappear. right. but why is it remaining if it's in lukewarm water? just that's a property of it? i mean if it's at room temperature water it remains? uh, you know like, say like you're mixing stuff like sugar, and if you mix in really cold water it takes more time to dissolve? okay, so so like hot water has, makes it go faster okay i'm gonna add it to warm water now. uhuh. ready? we're not gonna get all of it done (in one day) mix, um, (xx) i didn't i didn- (xx) did it remain the same...? um... i'm a little worried (xx) water. it's not that hot. i thought it would be, so. was it, it was like that before right? yeah. and so the temperature of the water, like, doesn't affect okay well this wasn't like boiling but it was warm. so what do we do? we don't know what it is. is there (an eraser) (xx) don't joke around in the lab Nick. it's just water. yeah, but (xx) water's (enough) how you guys doing (Ross?) uh, we're done with the (experimentation in) number four, and then we have now,  the precipitate's white. or, so, (xx) right (xx) but does it_ what does it exactly mean? does it mean like (xx) are you done Jeremy? i thought hey did somebody do number one? for, discussion you guys  do we get extra points (xx) yeah (of course,) no one wants to break up their groups but it's, just for presentation. i'll do it for five dollars... i'm gonna throw three pennies. why don't you call like,  so i can't throw two pennies cuz that's only you can throw one and throw it twice one person calls heads heads  so how does three pennies work? are you gonna flip three pennies and we call we each call  oh. okay. up up up is one. why don't we have  do you like to  what was the last one? shoot why don't you just throw one and throw it twice? one person because there's six teams you're gonna get  i don't care. it's not really a big deal what is what is she talking about? i don't know what she's talking about never mind um splitting up groups i don't know what she's doing splitting up groups (xx) because there, are too many groups  oh so one groups has gotta split up. she should probably split up our group because we only have three people team, team two call heads or tails heads heads? you guys are tails? i guess so. alright. who's heads? we are you guys won so i'm_ you guys are flipping the next (xx) (against the losers) so we're definitely not breaking up now? that's right we're definitely not breaking up tails tails? that's beautiful you're heads so, you guys are heads. so we don't have to um, you  who's won? um heads or tails guys? this is just crazy. um, tails. she is so cool. other people would just be like you're gonna do it. she's all trying to be fair about it heads (alright with you?) heads. who won. we won so, whoever got heads won. they lost twice so so (once we) so you guys called tails so you guys, so you guys (may get) split up. heads or tails guys? heads or tails? tails tails? it's not fair to them cuz they had to go twice. and they had another shot (xx) so you lost. okay, it's against you two guys to see (whose member's) pulled out. (what if it's) a tie? no no (xx) them against team number one chromate was C-R-four we're voting tails you're gonna vote tails? yeah chromate was C-R-four, two okay it landed on its side. what? no don't do that lemme flip it again. it landed on its side i don't lie. that's ridiculous let me try it again it's tails no it's tails see landed on its side again it's heads what do you mean it landed on its side? it was tails the last time yo but it was tails over there so you got one more. what does that mean? it was tails over there see all this means is that you guys are gonna have to do presentations with another group. so what? y'all lost to every group in here on a t- on a h- coin flip? alright i can't break them up because one of them commutes an hour to get here are you telling me y'all just lost every coin flip to every team in the class? yeah i think so that's horrible i need someone to volunteer. i really do cuz there's five questions. i have_ there's only_ there's six of you.  how 'bout we don't have to do it? (xx) no we can't do that you drive from Sterling Heights every day? yep even though he commutes an hour a day it doesn't make any difference i know it doesn't matter you don't hey (Diann) you don't need (xx) what? the fact that he commutes an hour to get here doesn't mean anything. hold on. what? the fact that he commutes an hour to get here doesn't actually mean anything. yes it does if he has to get together with a strange group. i don't wanna get together with them during their regular time. in other words he'd have to make s- different arrangements, to meet another group of people. well they're the same arrangements he's gotta make for other people i know but don't you guys already dak- meet that day or something? yeah we just meet a little bit beforehand. what does this presentation involve? it has to be done. just reading the sheet to the class? huh? what? (you have) to walk around and (xx) what does the presentation involve? what does it involve? what does it involve? you have to interpret the reaction. okay. that was my reaction. (xx)  as much as i know it i don't, i'm not too comfortable with it.  i wanna break up a group of three anyway. cuz it's one less person to worry about. alright,   i can break up but i won't do anything. (xx) i'll give you my paper do either of you guys mind getting getting broken up (xx) (Brad's) being a bitch what? (i'm not) a bitch you're a bitch hey Richard, you did one you go to the (xx) what? (xx) one person i need, one team you did one only right? no no no no, one person, so, one person has to go to another team. there's only five questions. unless, you know what? why don't you two g- why don't we just solve this, (we put) six of you? alright why don't you just, you two guys here, a megagroup no wait, why don't our two groups work together?  why don't we just put our two groups together? cuz that's like seven people. i (xx) what i'm gonna do is put these two groups together with six people (xx) alright so you guys alright with that?  whatever that's (xx) what i'm gonna figure out right now. does everyone want me to just randomly assign questions? cuz that's the only way i'm gonna be able to do this. yeah K-R (xx) alright? i'm gonna write le- i'm gonna write numbers down and everyone from each group can pick a number out of a hat. give me that hat. actually no wait wait wait, Ross, i want your hat okay  you know why i want his hat? cuz it's a Silicon Graphics hat. S-G-I. you wouldn't want this hat, (xx) um, did everyone get this review sheet? (a few) people did (xx) don't have that (xx) who did the last one? um my hair's all messed up. you guys have any of you guys done five? (xx) singing well i'll do five again Richard (xx) i didn't do five. let's go.   i wanna wear the gray thing with my little filter (how many) have i finished? two three four (xx) you guys finished too? alright, one, everybody from each group come up and, wait wait wait wait everybody from each group everyone come up who's    i got it alright. just reach in and take one. you guys everyone (who takes it, who takes first?) yes what is, what's the letter number? (who got) one letter, or number? okay, (next) okay we're done wait   is that the easiest one? oh oh easy (xx) numbers i have one left over who hasn't had a number? we don't... we don't that's this one that's the one you spent like the whole time on (xx) we don't need  we're not getting (resul-) we're not getting (xx) so good no it's not professional professional that's all i (had too) Ross. thank you thank you. i got to use your hat that's awesome.  what is this? we have to do number three what does (five) mean? didn't you hear me calling you? yes i did but i was focused can everyone be quiet for me cuz i'm gonna explain what's going on with the presentations cuz there seems to be some confusion which is understandable... perfectly understandable (i don't really get it) you are (xx) (xx) no uh'uh by yourself (xx) available (xx) alright. guys. alright. what you need to do, is, alright team number one what number do you have? four four you have four. you will write up every reaction except for number four. number four you keep to yourself after you write it up. oh (xx) set five? see this group presentation grade assignment? guys over in team five and six do you understand what you're doing today? yeah two you were supposed to grab us a different number i have a question  okay. now i'm testing for this. are you done? yep. so you're leaving aren't you? nah i'll wait around. i gotta be at work (later.) okay. now i'm testing for this stinky stuff. okay so now what_ what's the best thing for i_ for me to do? i looked all this up in the thing. is_ what's this mean right here? it said it's soluble, or something is it soluble in N-H_ in H-N-O-three? i guess that's what that means then do you have any of the solid? i think i might.  and what's... this is the melting point, so you can either melt it, try to dilute it, solid  um yeah, it's the greenish powder which is what, alright is there any of that? is there any of, what i- what is that called? it's_ it should be_ okay in the book they only had iron-three but i thought    two. you will pass in everything to me today except number two. number two you will be presenting next Thursday. two days that's awesome  (xx) class. so finish writing it up today and then you're presenting it on overheads or however you want to prove, your interpretation of the reaction. okay? and we're gonna_ and your classmates will be grading you. great oh boy okay well my only um everybody gets ten dollars they're doing five that's why no  so before you leave today i need all your sheets from you. yeah we'll help you guys through the process if you want you can clean up this stuff hm? if  ass (xx) had that (i don't think we got that) right before you leave. yeah. are we gonna get that quiz today? yeah (xx) (xx) correcting those i had 'em (xx) Mike isn't correcting them it's Trevor so um like where are we supposed to do to study  um, well you're not gonna get it today_ you're not gonna get the Lewis acid base back till Thursday. i mean just passed it in today. and the other lab you're just gonna have to, i mean the lab i'm passing back today. um, the quizzes, Mike has got and i don't know how long it's gonna take him to finish those. but, i don't know if he's correcting them now or not. (one to three is) (xx) hm? what happened to our other thing? Shannon is yours all done? yeah okay... (xx) nobody else wanted any others. um, why? (do you_ what) i dunno (this stuff) (xx) (from one to three) you think i should have some (xx) you didn't write down Brian did you finish? (your reactions) (xx) did you finish it? i'm on i'm working on five. is this  (xx) can't leave after (xx) okay it's the same as the front page. well write it over don't act crazy now. what are you talking about it's the same thing? they just put your extra space. no (xx) i'm saying write it over. (xx) since i   i just said chloride and sulfur are the reacting species because when they combine they form a white cloudy mixture with white solid precipitate oh alri- alright then. cuz i asked her what i was what i was_ ooh look at this. okay. there's mine that we have to turn in. (xx) i don't need that one i need number one. huh? i need your one. this is number one oh. who (all) did number three? i did... believe me i know all about it now. so what did yours turn out to be was it like impossibly hard or what? (mine,) yeah. i'm glad we didn't have to do it. oh. bitch. ours was cuz, ours was wrong cuz everybody's looking up the wrong thing in the C-R-C, which is like, threw everybody off, so it was kind of a  yeah. i  yeah. so do we need to meet or anything or are we just, all set? do you need to what? we don't need to meet or anything then right? no. (Jenna) will you please write this up (xx) sample i gave you here, (xx) i'll do it don't write, go and handle your business please hey (xx) what what'd you say? what'd you get from the C-R-C? um, a yellow precipitate. no C-U-C-L-two is (xx) C-U-C-L K-two-S-L-four oh okay so wait what did you have? is it C-U-C-L-three, right? (xx) makes sense and then the C-U-N-O-three is definitely (xx) C-U-C-L but it's like, um... plus another C-L-one (is three) like that's just associated (xx) yeah but you see where this, well basically this is_ wait but (xx) right oh okay i see hey wait this contradicts that (theory) because it says that um, no this is aqueous right then S-O-four, so you said that the (xx) should have gotten the reaction (xx) let's see well i know that it is, if i'm testing for this Catie right? uhuh   wait say that again? if i'm testing to see if this is a product yeah but it has to uh purp- the hexane'll turn purple if it's I-two. not if it's io- that's iodate yeah you get number five? what? what number do you have? four okay you get all of 'em no not her two. (xx) i don't really know what to do for a test of this did you look it up in the C-R-C? yeah i did  yeah i need a test to prove that    yeah yeah, it dissolves in H-N-O-three so d- add H-N-O-three to it. to this? yeah  whatever you think your product is i think my product is this. and that's what you looked up in the C-R-C, right? yeah but what_ what sense does that make i know that this dissolves in H-N-O-three already  but if you were to do that if you were to add that to the H-N-O-three and it does dissolve then that proves  yeah. did you look it up in the liquid form? does somebody have the iron sulfate? alright does anyone know what the iron sulfate looks like? (xx) iron sulfate looks like? it's got a red top on or something? i don't know how to look it up in the liquid form ask Shannon. Shannon. Shannon (xx) ask the smart boy um. i wanna know if i did this properly looking it up in the uh thing so, if you wouldn't mind, escorting me over to the C-R-C, okay. hey guys do we have to do the paper we have to (xx) huh? that wasn't my voice. what?   oh. we got a lot of sorting to do tomor- i mean Thursday. with  oh yeah. yep i'm not staying here so we can say uh, it's gonna take you fifteen minutes? we can say uh, yeah it shouldn't take me that long it's gonna take you fifteen more minutes? it shouldn't take me much longer than that. it's gonna take you fifteen more minutes? alright what um bye-bye to our wonderful presentation of today man that was fun that was like, not even any problems we sounded like we know exact- see_ i_ you always learn it right before you go up there like it'll_ you get this image of clarity. did it sound like i knew what i was talking about? yeah. oh why thank you yeah you said tons of stuff that i didn't understand well good perfect. yours was very clear, quite coherent. (that wasn't proved to me, that that's what this is) cuz i talk really slowly and (xx)    (xx) this or that? (xx) this yeah (xx) where's my hat? i'm stupid aw i don't even know what to do. i don't know  yeah. cuz i mean look at it up  (xx) you know it (xx) i'm going for a bike ride you're going for a boat ride? a bike ride oh. i wanna go on a boat, damn it. well come to New York, i've got a boat oh yeah with your swimming pool and all that. yeah my boat's in the swimming pool no but we get Shannon we get to use his swimming pool whenever we want. we're gonna have a, chemistry reunion at his at his pool. Shannon's pool what is it_ where is it? North Campus he works at the one on North Campus so i- he  huh? i've never been in that place me neither. the N-C-R-B no it's not that, okay this no it's not that one it's like a, i know it's not (it's) oh really the um, the Northwood place? yeah something like that that's cool. and there's not even a lifeguard so we can do crazy and kooky things and endanger our lives and (xx) he's not the lifeguard? no he just lets people in, so that's how_ why we can get in without really. ah i work right next to that place i work on the northmost part of North Campus well you should come to our chemistry reunion. we can test the chlorine content of the water. ya ha do you want something else to do? not really. oh get a test tube from up there. you can use my_ i broke one today so it's two-eighteen-B. just pick_ uh just oh shit i broke like two things. i wrote something in my book. he wrote something in his. you wrote something in yours. you wrote something in yours (xx) right? do you have everything that's supposed to be in your drawer? no we haven't sorted it but i know in_ that i (xx) test tubes cuz i broke it damn what did i break that one day? hey Ross, are you gonna be here after this semester? are you leaving after (xx) i'm gonna be here until next year (so) you're not going home at all? no. well i'm going home for a visit but not like yeah this this at the end of this month i'm going home for like ten days. for a highs- me too. for a graduation actually i'm going at the beginning of uh, of July, to go home, for ten days. yeah to see all my friends graduate. all your friends are in high school? if you want your exa- if you want your  you have friends i'm so proud. no i'm just kidding. uh it was just a joke. (xx) i i'm your buddy you didn't, you're not my buddy (xx) there's only two possible (counters) i didn't say it was (anything personal) but hey baby wanna (xx) asking me to help on clean up alright you're in a hole are you  he is, he's trying to. no, that's not part C, i need part C. you're_ i like how you're like, not rushing your pace you're just like i'm not there yet. so relaxed, so collected... (xx) presentation? this is number two they make these things (xx) they do. what do you call those? arms. (xx) three-point-seven-five (it's called,) silver nitrate does anyone object if i leave? um, i_ i object. sustained. just kidding i wouldn't do that. (xx) i should go to law school. so that was a joke you don't object? huh? so that was really a joke and you don't object...? we're all leaving so oh alright (xx) no. why don't i just turn it all in for everybody this one? yeah are you really almost done? i mean like if you got a lot to i have to do part C oh do you wanna see mine? what is, that's prove it that's uh, identification of the reaction products. it shouldn't take (you) too long to do it (xx) mine mine wasn't a reaction product. but the next thing i did, (xx) here's some presents for you. man, i hate drying_ i'm don't  never gonna use it again don't dry it just leave it oh well that won't happen anymore. rocks? what? oh rocks,  huh? seriously geology is fun, like alright, i'll talk, you can tell me what happens...  you don't mind (then) we're not gonna tell you alright. see you. no you're not, but, have fun. no you're not, you're not like sorry you're leaving. i'm_ well i'm not happy, i'm_ i hafta go to work so it's not like i'm leaving for a,  oh yeah we sure can yeah don't cry. how happy you are  aw we should have taken_ brought a camera and taken pictures we should have had like a chem shot man, a large group well this has all been videotaped. yeah that's  Catie this is your part. oh no. oh no? yay oh wait out of how many? out of sixty no. are you laughing at me? my conclusion was inappropriate, apparently hey Brian did you (xx) the reference point then looking up the thing in the C-R-C? and i'll look (xx) point-one molar. (Honeyann) (yes) hey Ann, what did you do for the next part (xx) we correctly identified our thing that we didn't know that we were here for so long with. we were like, i can't do that but there's nothing else you  uh (i think it's iron salt) can you help me for a minute? why do they never like our presentations? i don't understand. are you guys working on number five? yeah you guys (xx) you guys are doing (you're doing) five? they are. what are you guys doing for an experimental test? yeah them they over there what? what are you guys doing for your experimental test? oh we're just (mixing) like, (xx) compounds (xx) you know what i think i'm gonna go home and do some calculus, that'll be fun. fifty-seven oh yeah fifty-seven plus fifty-five (xx) ahh i need to study this hey Diann? yes? um. we may get out of here late (xx) what is your office (xx) (xx) wasn't Catie (xx) about what? identifying your um products. well mine was easier because, the C-R-C, like i had a white solid precipitate and the C-R-C said that it was a white solid precipitate so that matched right up, and then it said  (xx) well i don't i don't get a precipitate. where is (my solid?) yeah so, um, where'd i put it? where did it where did it go? did somebody move my stuff? somebody probably washed it out don't say that happened. pretty sure it did man, i wasn't finished, it was like, it looked kinda like this, somebody (xx) yeah, there's something (xx) i appreciate people trying to help but, now i'm frustrated about it. somebody_ what happens_ somebody washed out our tube alright. one of y'all people sorry i think i got   okay Catie  so you just put hers on the bottom and, staple it. mine? hers. hers okay. um, do, what about the, do it with the he's acting, you know how he is, i can't talk to him but he's gotta get (two in though) is he_ what_ how many experiments is he doing? i don't know what he's doing. he's_ but he's doing this one right now so he should be (xx) you right? i don't know why it's taking me so long to do this i guess cuz i started one and then i had to restart or something i don't know, i'm just slow. that's all that it is that's the bottom line hey Brad yes? i don't wanna have to go through (xx) can you s- do you have some information for us? (skew) some information (xx) can i help you, what do you want me to do? we need to know, what's up, on part C.  you know how that is, between the two (of us) oh (xx) i already did that one no but he's doing it right now i didn't get that one. thanks for your help though. that's cool. why did you do that? to clean the set. oh okay... well... it wasn't obvious is that slow or what? in other words you were saying talk to Brian and find out you know what i mean? he was like well i didn't do that one... idiot so i guess we have to it again huh? that's what i have to do, one again, one more time okay i know it's not K-two-S-O-four because K-two-S-O-four did not react.  it told me_ all it said was like what, what temperature the solid melted under. and i don't know where the liquids are i really don't know how to use the C-R-C okay now let me see (that one) i didn't get a precipitate that's the thing, i just got, a color, change. that's it. Lindsay, none of my groups wanted to grade (xx) discussion so okay   uh, what i guess let's mix it again boy. okay. one more again, H-two-S-O-four two drops i like pretty (xx) this is just so cool did you guys get iron sulfate? you guys get it? no i can't handle it (xx) i have lots.  hm well this is mine... 	1
LES235SU099.json	okay why don't we get started, alright as you see we've got a slightly unusual, event today we're being taped, and uh, basically we'll just pretend they're not here which is_ was their request, uh before we get going with the selection sort again are there any questions about anything...? okay. well what i'd like to do first... is review the algorithm, we did go through it yesterday but i think this is uh tough enough to understand that we probably oughta go through it, uh, quicker this time but go through it again, and then when we look at the code, i think it'll be easier to understand if we've just looked at these, uh graphics again to see how the sort works. so first of all the idea was to take this array, those five elements, and of course put it in ascending numeric order, and that would give us, this array over here. uh one thing that i didn't mention yesterday is that, this sort is called a an in place sort because it sorts the array, uh changes the contents of the actual array. it's also possible to do a sort where you make a second copy, keep the original and then put a sorted, array in a second, data structure. so that's not what we're doing we're actually doing the sort inside the array. and let's actually go through this algorithm again, we said there were N minus one passes, here N is five so we'll do we'll do four passes, and we said each one, uh essentially takes us through the array elements one time, we look at them all, we take the, item that's in the starting position for the current pass, and we exchange that or swap it, with the smallest item, that's in the unsorted part for the current pass. so essentially the idea is on one pass to sort one item, and we know from yesterday's, fairly quick discussion that after four passes, five elements would be sorted. and that's always the case, always N minus one. uh, it's worth noting at this point actually that this sort is not the most efficient sort, in the world we'll talk about that a little bit more later, but if you think about it, this sort does exactly the same process, even if the whole array is in order to begin with. it always does N minus one passes, it's not very intelligent it doesn't look to see, uh if perhaps, something could be done quicker than that. kay. so we keep doing this, and let's take a look again at these diagrams... so this is our starting point, initially the whole array's not sorted, that's the assumption, and the starting point would be the thirty-two, that's the index of zero, and we know that on the first pass we took that element, and we exchanged it with the smallest item that's in the entire array. so the thirty-two and the minus-sixteen get swapped, so in the array they have to trade places, and then what we have after that is, this, contents in the array where the minus-sixteen is in the right spot, and the other items are still considered unsorted. so we've got one item that got sorted on the first pass. now, this is our starting point for the second pass, so let's take a look at that you have, you have at most N minus one, um, passes right? mhm actually, that's a really good point the, the selection sort always does N minus one passes. even if doesn't need to. even if, they're already in order? yeah even if they're already in order. it just doesn't sw- switch 'em? yeah it doesn't uh there's no way to exit this algorithm, because, the list is sorted. have you seen the bubble sort before? perhaps cuz i'm wondering if maybe you're thinking, that one, um, that's a sort where, once the list is sorted actually you can exit, the algorithm. uh oddly enough it's less efficient than this one which is why we cover this one in class. did anyone see that in high school or somewhere else, bubble sort? okay. oh Jim saw it very good. should that be N minus two in the, header? no because it's less than. good question Jim, you're totally wr- yo- you'd lose the value in start. yeah exactly. uh you can't do a swap in two statements because you lose one of the values. alright you can try, if you're not convinced um tracing through it and, you'll see that one of the values gets lost they're both equal to the same thing. uh, let's say that, this is, three and five. what would happen is that A-sub-start would get set to five, and then, A-sub-small is already five, but you're copying a five into it. kay it's, pretty much a useless, sequence of code and you just wiped out one of the values. so that's why we need a third variable to actually do this process, uh any time we wanna do an exchange like that. kay well that's the end of the, loop that does, a pass, and you can see there are basically two processes going on here, the first, small for loop... kay this one, where we look for the smallest item, and then the second part here is, this part where we do the exchange. so we do that four times, and then, uh as we saw with that small array at the end of that we're all sorted. now one thing to notice is that, uh, if you trace through this code with, uh as Meredith said an array that's already all in order, basically you go through the whole thing anyway. so efficiency is not our, crowning glory here with this sort, uh but as i mentioned it is pretty decent for small N. alright did you have a question? yes, if you, if you have an error in your, um, code and you compile it, um, if_ (say) you have something like this is_ do you like ruin your file for good, or, do you have to start over with a  i'm not sure what you mean are you, you talking about destroying the original data? yeah  if uh, if you read a bunch of data in from a file, and then did this, in the program, you'd be altering the array in memory, only, but then if you were really using a file what you'd probably do is write out the array to the file at the end, and then yeah you would, ruin the file basically. kay so it's definitely possible to, uh lose a lot of information with just a tiny little, bug like this. kay any other questions about the, sort here? kay well, i think it's kind of amazing the first time i saw it which was i think nineteen seventy-four, uh, i thought my goodness, so (you're gonna) have to declare a, a, record variable for every, record you wanna enter? well that's a really good question. uh you're thinking ahead here, uh, if you really were writing MIRLYN, you wouldn't declare book one book two book three book four, i mean we'd be sitting there typing all day long. uh what we'll talk about after our, initial discussion of, of, just single structs here is how to set up an array of structs. because, of course the library's not gonna have one book or three or or whatever it's gonna have, lots and lots and lots. so, one possible data structure is, uh to declare this book record, and then declare an array of, book records. uh that's the other possible, data structure you can use on program six if you would like to. uh actually you've got a choice either parallel arrays or, an array of structs. so that's a good point we're gonna get to that, uh, not today obviously but we'll, we'll probably be talking about that tomorrow. you, you can, just, um, you can do that in initialization, like, um, A, equals ten but not here, um, the  yeah you just, you can't, use assignment with arrays except when you declare them and you initialize 'em that's what Polly was saying, so no i can't do that. even though it looks like an analogous operation, it's not possible. uh what could i do instead? let's say i did wanna copy all of B into, A. what would i be able to do, in C-plus-plus that would work? 	1
LES500JU136.json	um  who? that would be me. yup, uh i found the article, that uh i actually, i ran into it, this weekend, that uh, supported your point about uh the stereotype threat for white males. uh, didn't you make that point when we were talking about stereotype vulnerability? about, it being helpful to certain groups? oh yeah i guess that would, you're right i'm sorry. this is about Asian-Americans. okay alright thank you. there are a couple of uh lectures that are kind of relevant to what we've been talking about there's one this noon, Is There a Development Trajectory to Homicide by Young Males? by Professor Loeber from the Free University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. and it's going to be at the Center for Human Growth and Development, which is the old s- well it's three hundred North Ingalls Street, uh room one thousand it's up on the tenth floor. so anybody interested, lunch is provided, uh but if you're interested in youth violence uh, uh that'll be an interesting, lecture. then on Friday, there's a seminar on culture and cognition, at ten thirty A-M Friday, by John Jost who's a professor at Stanford on the system justification function of stereotyping, in Italy Israel and the United States. and uh, i assume that's something about uh why stereotyping is maintained by, uh various groups. that's gonna be in thirty forty-eight East Hall ten thirty A-M Friday. yeah. i'm sorry 	1
COL140MX114.json	exciting presentation, uh today by uh Professor, David Rolston, uh which looks quite interesting but before we get started i'd like to make a couple of announcements. the first one, is that our next brown bag presentation will be next Tuesday October seventeenth, Ronald thank you. can you give any comments about the, the speed, versus, the (xx) the pace? yes you can say that. uh you know, Peking opera cannot never go faster rock and roll (xx) things can go extremely quickly on the Peking opera stage, and they can go extremely slowly. actually as a foreigner first watching Peking opera i liked when they went slow, cuz i could keep up with the subtitles just fine. but there is that contrast there but in general the pacing is slow. why? because the focus is on the expression of emotion, and you hafta have a certain amount of_ you build up to that expression of emotion but the things that people remember about plays are the outpouring and overgushing of all this emotion which takes time for it flow all over the place. and so, it is a kind of a slow-paced in general orientation. and they used to be the performances were extremely long, sometimes six seven hours. and this is for people who have time on their hands right?  mhm   well one thing is that things changed when Peking opera was put into, new-style theaters, right? the performance, the way people, react to performance was different. and so they would pay attention when they wanted to, and talk with their friends. i showed you pictures of one of the restored theaters, upstairs actually the most expensive places the little private rooms, you can't see the stage, worth a, a hoot. and so it's clearly that this was a social place where people would go, they could hear the music they want, if something exciting (go) they could come out of the little room, and go to the railing and watch what was going onstage. but uh a very different relationship. what happened in the P-R-C is that they wanted to imitate the Soviets for instance and you sit in a regular theater sitting in cushiony chairs, and you sit there and you're quiet, right? which is very different from how you used to clap, (xx?) so it's very different, from performance style and appreciation style. yes? yeah i guess maybe one concern would be the content of the opera like uh recently, uh, they've, rewritten a a old uh, opera to address the issue of injustice, mhm mhm mhm  yeah uh, it seems to me that there's two separate issues here. one is the issue of, appealing to a current generation, uh of a Chinese audience  mhm mhm mhm      mhm  hm'  mhm mhm right mhm  mhm  (i've spent) most of the last three summers doing that. you did i think that i agree with that and, i mean, having, seen White Snake, i think that most of the students who went to see it with, tended to see right through kind of the,  i think there's also a quality and attitude issue, because uh, the senior people won't touch the stuff right? so you never see a, a good actor onstage doing it, and there's a certain amount of cynicism that comes in, because they_ if they do what they're supposed to do then they don't, necessarily get the right oksa- uh reaction out of the audience there's no reinforcement from that. and so you see a lot of sloppy stuff going on, so even the elements that they are using in tourist opera, are generally not done very well. and so i think there's a general devolution, going on, which is unfortunate. yes? is- we should remember i mean i'm not, well educated in this but thirty years ago when i was here Professor Jone, who drew, large crowds for his annual  (well,) no he he did i (mean) so  mhm right right right so even somebody like Ravi Shankar, will often give a kind of a lecture demonstration before the real  yeah but if the if the politicians who are running the tourist industry now it's very clear, mm  right right     mhm   there are similarities of course with Western opera, many of the Western opera stories are as silly as you get many of the Peking opera stories are as silly as you get. um, and uh you have people talking about, that Western opera is doomed, right? William Bolcum here who writes opera (music) reviews said he doesn't see much future for the form. and so uh, it_ you know there're the same kind of problems over here with Western opera. one is this this gushing out of emotion that some people have a lot of trouble with. i guess i don't have as fatalistic a view of things but i'm not, i don't have the same expertise but um, i've seen really interesting ways that opera is used in spoken drama and in   mhm mhm sure  or yeah or it's got uh like Mei Xiaowu uh Mei Lanfang's son has this tape out and uh he- the  mhm   mm you'll notice at the end i compared what they want kids to begin watching, and what they're presently showing Westerners. so they're basically infantilizing Westerners   mm right   you cannot even claim that Westerner, all the Westerners are here they know what they're doing, yeah mhm   uh they're not following the plays very closely and they're, not, uh, they react very differently from, the way the plays posit the audience. so they have trouble fitting into the implied audience   yeah,  um i'm wondering if these theaters or the Chinese tourist authorities differentiate between what you were calling as Western tourists and,     i think the only way to appreciate, Peking opera and understand Peking opera is to, watch it and listen to it over and over. mhm mhm  and i, i don't think we can, fall in love with Peking opera at first sight. mhm, the old model is that your parents would go take you to the opera right? and they'd be right there and they'd tell you what you're watching, uh well i remember going in nineteen eighties and listening to, Chinese who had brought foreigners to watch a David what about the situation in Taiwan? uh Taiwan is very different uh more conservative, uh they've tried to keep the stages, and staging much more traditional so they use propping for instance. but again there's no audience,  huh oh really mhm any reevaluate the uh Mao's wife work she is for the you know Asian she studied Peking opera,  uh  just um, thing to toss out, we used to think beauty was in the eye of the beholder but it seems like, recent research has shown that, beauty's sorta universal.  are more sellable? well that's probably because Western culture has spread so far. yeah mhm 	1
SGR999MX115.json	and then ask how she reacts. so, you know this, well,  so, politics would be how, um, a society should act, in existence. yeah,  which is what? so well that one was, man's, man's relationship to existence in terms of, action which relates man's values with other men's values. so that was like man with man, mm well why... why would why would couldn't it just be an explicit, like can't it concretize an explicit philosophy under certain, i mean you think  yeah you know yeah but then why did she, i'm just wondering why we, go through uh, yeah yeah but i mean for some people it's obviously, it's   yeah it doesn't have to be, (cringing) okay. uh do you want to try number, two? alright i got the easy one actually. um, an axiom, it's just the, the very fundamental of the fundamental. it's the very starting point, of everything about philosophy. so you begin with them, mm yeah, i had two uh, two parts, to my idea of this one. one was, i think that, yeah i think this is also related to what you're saying. is that you need to validate, u- or if you want to validate, your principles, you wanna make sure that, the principles the fundamental principles are correct. mm okay    i don't know, i don't know   catch phrases? yeah  yeah i m- but i think you really would need to know that, it is for, you know finding the area, under things other- otherwise, we're finding the area of objects you wouldn't know, y- i mean how could you even,  let's use a different example and i don't mean to get off topic but let's say right right  yeah you wouldn't have to know in that case. but i mean i, i don't know if that's the case that i would arg- i'm  what you're basically saying is that we could make like an artificial intelligence by make- just making a huge look-up table and hav- if if this then that if this than that and it's just,   well it can't even imi- i mean, in practical terms like in reality, you know w- we've tried this method  that's true i i i b- we probably could- we couldn't even make a widget maker. a widget (maker) scandalous so if all that guy did was do widgets all day long it sure, but so we can at least agree that, that principles make things a hell of lot more efficient and, and, cuz i mean i guess yeah but right yeah, they- i know yo- we- i mean Peikoff argues a very stronger point mhm mhm mhm mm yeah i have a question about that also. like on page four he says um, yeah the proof is the inescapability of it, that is what proves what is an axiom. i thought that's what, i thought sh- they were making the distinction between validation and proof, yes   then, (alright,) i d- i mean i know it's a subtle, it's, yeah i'm, so what are the axioms? okay i'll do this one. okay so existence exists, and then, now the second, uh this this next axiom, has been stated several different ways like and, to me i think, this way is the best way i don't know, the other ways are (xx) okay you exist possessing the ability to be aware of existence. you think that's the best way to state yeah i mean, because okay now this is, this is well he says here okay, you exist possessing, consciousness. okay  is conscience. the whole idea of c- i mean in my personal opinion the whole idea of consciousness isn't informative in any way because the philosophers can do nothing when defining consciousness but saying oh well you know it's that thing that you, feel you know that thing i don't know i can't quantify it or qualify it it's just, that thing. so i don't, i don't think you should rely on, the word consciousness to give you any information. well that's why i rephrased it the way  mhm but if consciousness captures that phrase then why not just use the word consciousness? cuz that has so many other qual-  so does selfishness but... okay and so, the next one was uh, to be, i just said to be a certain something. okay okay (xx) yeah i think that adds, something (i don't know.) and then uh, so the physicists are wrong about the wave particle duality right? well i know see that's why i would you know it argues against that    how s-  yeah (xx) uh could somebody pl- ex- explain (that) to me? of the wave? yeah i don't, know what it is. um, you could  yeah yeah  exactly. yeah.  so that that was the significance of that statement how could you well actually i get into more on that, later. because, uh the thing is, what really, what really bugs me, or was bugging me_ okay, out of the three axioms the first two i cannot, i cannot imagine a way, that they can be wrong, okay?  more substance? yeah, more substance to the identity, axiom. and so, later on in one of these questions i get into, one issue, i think, i think i've resolved but i still have feelings of doubt. and i don't know why but i still have them. wha- i just, i was just thinking of it personally but, i don't know i just think term, mathematically i don't know why. yeah well, i think is this, do you think that i would be right in incorporating the water versus H-two-O argument in here, that you're familiar with. incorporating it?   no, mhm  X-Y-Z, that's what they call it. yeah yeah but tha- why would tha- that would definitely, i don't think that would be argued against the identity. that would just say that, you ha- would have to, it's just like finding uh, intelligent life somewhere else, that, you know rational animal then we would have to just say that, humans are_ you would have to be more specific about,  yeah that's a really good point. i agree with what he said though i think, th- the identity axiom's pretty trivial i don't see why you think it's substantitive. like what what is it about that axiom that you think is,  okay. well God has characteristics who says,  perfect   right yeah   relate this to the identity axiom for us i okay the identity axiom is, to be, is to be, is to basically to be is to, be, is to have, a sum of attributes and characteristics. that's what identity, is. okay so you're saying everything that doesn't have, a set of attributes, and characteristics does not therefore exist? that's the as- yeah that's the assumption behind that, axiom yeah, now but in that case you said you were okay with it. i was okay with that.  mhm why do they  because okay for instance, if i say that, this table is red, and, black at the same time, that's essentially saying that it's red and non red, at the same time. so then i can see how it cancels out so, i don't know i mean that's where i'm at now i guess, okay   no no it's saying it doesn't exist. oh okay. oh so this problem only applies to like, particle waves    no  yeah in the beginning he says to be something. but then you'll see like uh, in the causality chapter, when he refers to identity, he does say you know to b- to be is, essentially to be something, specific does he incorporate a different an an additional argument with that or no? well, actually later on, now this is a- related to infinity. now, he says, infinity, cannot exist, because, of the identity principle. okay? and this is basically on this. it's gonna come back to, it always comes back to if it's something is uh, breaking the identity principle it comes back to saying, the key is that it does not have any characteristics. so how does infinity have no, characteristics? how does Peikoff say it? what he says is, that infinity says what that's really saying is that, you're always, large... something i- something that is infinitely large mean- does not mean that it's just very large. what it means is, it's w- it is uh, it's identity  no because he says that there is no, there is no, you know, thing. can it how can_ can it be infinite, i mean, it's not a number it's just, a constant.  mhm right oh okay right    small large yeah you're right that's a logical yeah. well it's the same thing  here let me just uh, let me just do, say that... so i was that's where i started having a problem when he tried to deny infinity, you see.  it is, yeah right and also like what he s- Steve said earl- Steve right? yeah what he said earlier about a wave particle duality you can it's, you can just say well i- in one context if you just take context into it then one context mhm and that's no yeah but he doesn't say you know Peikoff doesn't say something is something if it's something once in a while or most of the time or (xx)   right but i- right i- it the the thing about the law of identity is it does not exclude, change. i mean, change is perfectly fine but i mean which is mhm hm we're in the second part of number three i think. right do you want to try this? which, is it the what exactly  what is? strangely enough,     okay uh, where are we now? second question  yeah but you lo- you said things that exist_ do things that exist exist? so you loaded the question, so there's, haven't you so that, yeah it has to be, yes (they are.) yeah okay basically      is there a split? if-  and, now i originally answered that cuz i got confused i thought you were and this is why i don't think it has much bite in it at all, okay?    Kant does.    yeah you see what i mean? mhm it'd be,     no but but the beauty of the axioms is is they have to use them to,  and the thing about okay since we're on this topic, about, proof, and why you cannot pro- th- okay, there's an issue that you cannot prove the axioms. well the way to look at it is this is better than proof. okay is that it's, self-evident is what proof is based on. so i don't know it's an example (xx) because sometimes people say like, you know you can't prove it as if it's a deficiency, it's actually, in this  yeah but i, you know?    mhm    oh okay. yeah  your form  uh huh  right but that's what you just claimed was self-evident. no no no i no if if i, oh i i feel you i feel you  right yeah but that's the only thing i can say that's self-evident. right okay good okay w- that's,  okay  oh the next part of uh, yadda yadda, what exactly is consciousness? you want me to take that one. i know this is horrible don't blow the   yeah just according to what  well, not sp- okay in here he uses perception. okay but then he quantifi- he qualifies it with, m- that he really means awareness. which is funny, okay, but anyway fine that's all okay, because there are forms that they don- p- there are animals supposedly that don't perceive, but are aware, and they have consciousness. animals? i suppose that's what i that's why i'm thinking. do you mean like amoeba? uh but they're not having perceptions. animals without a nervous system,  how do you know?   okay not a bat but you know, i know what it's like to be an amoeba. i read Dennett, today and i drew a picture of him as Superman, faculty basically of awareness yeah, so can you  well i think, the argument is that there are, there are beings that, can become aware without young young children,  mhm alright yeah now get to the more controversial ones.  um cognition? memory um, yeah i think no thinking i could s- definitely see is in that, uh for humans uh, you mean like   yeah what's the definition of faculty? or no we're not we don't have faculties yet, processes. you're calling feeling a process? what do you mean by you mean, fe- emotion or do you mean just like, sensation when you say  okay, so you're wondering if if emotion is a, ne- necessitates consciousness? is it a means, of consciousness. what do y- a means? emotions? is it a way in which we would we express our awareness no i- is it, is it, a thing that we use, to become aware of existence, to gain knowledge of existence. to gain knowledge of of existence? emotions, is that what you're asking yeah now i mean i thought about this, all day and i think i've come up with an answer. i, it seems to me that w- now see thinking it's clear you know that's a way we become, you know we, we come to conclusions to know, you know existence. but how about for you? well first you have to say what's an emotion? wait i'm i'm still not it's confused to me because, does, so, obviously Ayn says that it's possible to to... i'm just  no well all i wanted, yeah all i'm saying is,  mhm  mhm   well, the way you described it you said, you said, Ayn says that you assign a truth value to something once you perceive it?      and is this, this value judgment is what you're referring to as emotion? no. no, okay. okay you have an object let's say this book. mhm mhm mhm okay so and if you saw it burning you would, be sad, (well) you know and when i read the parts about uh volition i have a different emotion. there you go, yeah. cuz you have a different, value judgment, consciousness  that's not, real- oh well my theory about the feeling i- in regards to consciousness is i think it's a product of consciousness. i think that's a good theory. and i don't know i'm gonna see if if we go on when we get into emotions if that holds out. um okay a well, if if we're gonna see if that holds out or not then i need to know what do you mean by, a product of, consciousness? do you mean a result of? what are the  so  so wha- that would be wrong how? like what wou- how could that be wrong? if i said that you could experience emotions without a cognitive experience that (might be)   how could that be wrong?   uh huh  no yeah i'm i'm saying that in that sense, i could think it's a tool of cognition. it's a tool it's a way of gaining knowledge, about reality, but uh, apparently not. no cuz if you well   right just doubt, yeah so how does that get, how does, it gives him   well she well she says that it it's just i mean it's uh it's just a light it's a first approximation to, to, you know his innate_ you have to you you, it is, it is an evaluation but then you have to like check it and make sure. whereas that's that's that's exactly why you cannot, maybe when they s- she says it's not a tool of cognition, well uh, in a bigger picture, knowing Ayn's feelings towards emotion, i don't know, i i find it, i don't know if she would approve of, of us saying that, yeah that is what i'm yeah. so if, if if Ayn's goal is a cognition that's purely rational sans emotion i think you can make a distinction between cognition and like, mm rationalization    mm yeah      it's the cognition that you do but yeah i think that's just what i was gonna about to say let me see if i can rephrase it for you,  i think maybe, it's like i mean feelings help me all the time i'm telling you, i mean that's, they help me,   yeah now, can it be also said that, you would not feel that doubt unless you knew somewhere deep inside that you weren't understanding that text? um, what's that again? okay so you're saying subconscious knowledge?   oh emotion springs  you know that's right  yeah  yeah but sub- we're almost saying that subconscious, knowledge is is is conscious knowledge and it's not, i mean consciousness subconsciousness is not part of, consciousness. so maybe we wanna agree on on the process, of the following. i read a text, my deep down body instinct tells me that i have no idea what the hell is going on, it creates a d- doubt in me, but i and i don't have access to that that deep down body knowl- or, right  yeah. yeah i think, let's just leave it at that and uh, let's talk about our feelings some more though. because that's a very,  okay good do you want to take this one Steve, faculties what are faculties.  or, what are just other types, give examples of_ because i was headed_  how about  how about like, a a simpler of consciousness? no of, a faculty that's, not smell touch yeah hear... see would you, include motor stuff too? what's that? motor, things also? like if he's just saying sensory things but, would like kicking, you know i i have a  is it? it's a i have an ability to kick yeah. so faculty is  what's that? so faculty is synonymous with ability? i think ability power, i figure i when i looked it up it was like, there was power, ability capacity so facult- hm well if it's ability then i'll always have i'll always have the potential to do it but if it's power then i... then i can have the potential to do it but still not be right? still not have the power to do it (xx) what's that again? let's say like i need your permission to leave (this room.) and you're not giving me, right the permission to leave, but i still have, i still have the ability to (leave the room) and, i don't have the power. ah so, i think we'd better define it as ability, (i i don't know.) so there's well if there's an infinite a- amount of faculties then? really you could kick you know, but i mean i don't know if i'd, does it make sense i have a faculty to do this i thought like faculties were more, maybe, grouping abilities, into a faculty. i don't know i mean i, i just, like this is uh this is really, my own, take, you know i mean so well i thought all th- ar- aren't all these questions from, no these are just Erik's personal questions. oh    i know because i don't want to keep posting the questions and it's  yeah   yeah this th- i don't, i don't see anything wrong with doing those questions but, but anyway let's let's not  five bucks i think. yeah capitalism yeah it's going to cost more to ship that to me than it the book is worth yeah buy something else while you're there. yeah that's right...  what's pithy mean? i don't know, it just (sounded good.)  (alright,) (xx) you're clever okay you guys i got a really bad verbal score on my G-R-E so this is what i'm going to do if anyone asks me about it i'm just gonna like say that like my personal philosophy is not to believe in any static or standard definitions of anything so i refuse to even try.  that's right, it's probably (xx) okay, well we trying to,  number four yeah number four now this one i thought was really cool. it took me like two days so you go with (it anyway.)    thank you i just kind of looked over these i didn't, try to answer some of them oh, aren't the first three like, the same? that's what i tried to say they're not. no but, this is really neat where you get into the subtlety of it, each of these you get a different, it focuses on the axioms in a differ- you learn something, it's saying something about the axioms (a little bit differently.) primary's first. yeah, you're right. fundamental is, the thing that can account for, most of the others. yeah irreducible means it can't be reduced, can't be broken down. yeah, more on that though i mean like i can't break down, um, maybe a uh physicist would say you can't break down some subatomic particle.  it can't be logically simplified further? conceptually it's i think that's close yeah,    yeah that's not  well, i- uh inescap- i think,  no, i-   no okay inescapab- right, inescapable, was always p- presupposed. which is what you  so let's go back to irreducibles can't be broken down. can't be further simplified right? right yeah yeah well let's see (xx) some of this crap. (xx) alright self-evident is, self-evident what's that is that something how do you expl- the evidence for something is, contained within itself. good  and then went to (work on his paper.) okay so, yeah the self-evident was uh first and foremost  if you're tal- talking about time in terms of axioms though why not say that, it's the axioms, that's where you have to the starting point. or you can do that. um, and then also if if you take the primary to mean uh, first in importance, i would think, that just makes sense since, in terms of validating, you know, and that it would be the most important to validate this one first before all the others. and then uh fundamental i thought that stresses, okay fundamental, inescapable, and irreducible, i thought all focus on epistemology, okay in the sense of knowledge okay. now, fundamental i thought was, it's saying that a lot of th- okay the definition of fundamental was, that upon which everything else in a given context depends. so, when i think of that i think i think o- of a of just a a tree okay in my mind. in that, there is like all these other, logical dependencies, to these other principles coming from this base. now, inescapable, to me says that all knowledge, depends on it. so this to me lowers, basically it's saying it's that it is the root of all branches of everything it is at the root. you know because uh fundamental is saying that, it's the root within a certain context. now inescapability is saying it is the root, in all contexts, of knowledge. i don't know i thought that. okay  sure another illustration just, briefly fundamental is um, the Protestant church often uses the example of the cornerstone i don't know if any of you have ever heard of a cornerstone. like, back in Jesus' days or whenever uh they, they built stones and there was one primary stone that like took most of the brunt, apparently i don't know how that works geometrically but, and they referred to it as the cornerstone. so Christ is always the cornerstone of the Protestant religion. i just thought that might (xx) anyway i'm sorry continue. and then uh, and then when i thought about irreducible was that, there is no, basically my tree thing will fall dow- okay my tree analogy would totally fall down here because i'm saying that, there's nothing that comes before it there's no knowledge that, it depends on. so, i was in a sense it'd be like a tree without roots. but, i  what,  so why do you think it's so um important to make these teeny tiny tiny little distinctions? uh, yeah i   are we saying why use precise language is that your, conflict no i just you you were like oh it's really cool once you get in and figure out what all these mean they're really abstract and obscure and well, no and i agree that she she should be as precise as possible    i'm sorry i don't, i don't  mhm  that's not your next question that's number seven. no i know but no that's just what i'm thinking about always (thinking.) i don't know  right i have no idea. well one thing is that axioms are, propositions and axiomatic concepts are just concepts, so that's one distinction. so an axiomated, an axiomatic concept, may not, m- may not have, an an axi- axiom as a referent? axiom (xx) uh so ev- if, if all my axiom_ like if i'm, my only axiom is like, whatever exists exists then i can't_ then can an axiomatic concept be like, God is omnipotent? no so the ki- concepts aren't propositions,  oh okay alright i'm sorry that's, very clear. okay do you wa-     here was, i i thought though there was one example that really clarified something for me uh was, something self-evident, of course, does not necessarily have to be inescapable. okay? let's see, uh for instance, it's self-evident that i have a thumb okay, to me right now. okay, or that i am aware of a thumb in (xx) uh that i, um, but, it's it is escapable in terms of my knowledge. for instance, my knowledge of um, how to drive a car does not depend on me knowing if i have a thumb or not. well actually,  we know   (xx) yeah so, i don't know. yeah that's really interesting. a quark is, irreducible (that's,) an example outside philosophy, at least quarks are theorized to be irreducible, by some and (not by me) but something, a quark's made up of something isn't it? well there's there's, things that have two third- no quarks are the ones that have two thirds charge right? it's either, plus two thirds or, minus two thirds and then yeah and there's six left there's, there's six things that make up okay, forget it maybe leptons are   gluons there we go. gluons yeah i think you're right  yeah    hm    primary is, cognitive science because it's, first and foremost of impor- portance, but it's not fundamental,  or maybe sensations could be, primary, to, u- to our, ability to be aware, yeah  uh when you were  describe it. it's like a g- a ghost, uh       yeah yeah,  uh i don't know. perception maybe maybe perceptions, uh anyway, that's a damn hard question (xx) okay, um, who are, who are we up to now? you-  no i didn't (xx)   i'll go. okay you go,  all of these things.   (kind of ) like how the mental urges was uh, inescapable oh how is, the axiom, primary and, fundamental and by definition it is all of these things. oh yeah that is the definition. yeah i don't know, are are you just do you, are you just intending for us to just sit and marvel for a second about how wonderful it is that the axioms can be all of these things? or are we gonna try to come  yeah well i was just thinking that, like for instance, self-evident mhm  uh i was even trying to think, if it's self-evident, you cannot even try to find, you can't esc- it's almost like you can't find evidence that, does not, you know if i tried to, if i tried to find other evidence to prove, that's why it can't be proved basically is because if i tried to find, evidence that did not it'd have to be like something you didn't perceive  so it can't even (define) that in that sense it really, is self-evident. mhm yeah i think it's a big difference to say that it can be self-evidence than it is to say that it can only be yeah that's the, that's but they're necessarily circular because the arguments all presu-  yeah maybe he, he didn't mean, is this recently that you spoke with Eric Lormand? in the summer. di- perhaps then that like, a a way for philosophers to define like, awareness or con- conscious experiences to say it's it's just like this and they give you examples. so maybe you meant like analogous proof or something? well,  okay yeah let's not. yeah, okay. but it was interesting. (xx) how about inescapable though maybe like so what, yeah yeah like for instance how about when the, physics the physicists say, you know because in order for them to say it's a wave they have to say it's something, and, that's, that it's a wave, so that's using the identity, and the same thing in order for them to say, it's a particle they have to... they have to say it is something, that it is a particle, and it has the sets the properties that the particle set. the same thing for waves so they have to use, in order to make that statement they have to use the identity, axiom. mm, yeah. okay do you, you want to move on to the next one? sure, uh, yeah  (exactly okay) yeah i mean when you prove things like, i observe that, it's, consciousness, existence and identity all together i mean. (i know) yeah so self-evident (xx) so then that's the s- the second one he said what's a relationship, it's, the basis, perceptual data's basis, for, proof. Justin do you wanna take the next one since i think (xx)?  no number five yeah it's    yeah the same example well should we start off with one of your, examples  hm oh jeez. this one i had trouble with. oh see first you have to ask yourself what's consciousness. it's awareness and then when would it be helpful uh for you, to know, that you have the ability to be aware, can you think of any examples (xx)? when you face danger, when you need to solve a problem? when you face the question, should i take a certain drug or not, to alter the awareness, (i don't know.) um,  well, i (think...)  i don't need a reminder um, here's here's one that i thought of, i thought, um... this actually slightly happened to me was, okay let's say you're promoted in your job or something at work, mhm    yeah i don't know if that's a direct it's not a very, that one wasn't, it was my least, it wasn't my best. this is for the the  knowing the axioms. i would say that the, g- axioms themselves don't give us any guidance,   well     here's the thing yeah here's here's what okay, when i thought of it i thought, the axioms are good for two things the way i looked at it. was one, they're the basis for other principles, that, seem more directly useful. mhm mhm it's closer to the identity   maybe instead of it,  i wouldn't i wouldn't say that the axiom itself, guides you i would say that maybe the, knowledge,   yeah isn't the skin mark a better example of identity though because you,  i think you could argue it's all three. yeah cuz   mhm  mhm did you just do number six when before? uh, no this one's, (i think i don't know.) uh, you haven't really read the chapter. yeah sorry. uh, you wanna try this one Steve?   um, existence exists, and, um...  and then what were some other things that we talked about. so what are they the basic axioms is what you're asking why are they the basic axioms? yeah because they're irreducible primaries. yeah  yeah, that's, i think yeah you, um, now this one i didn't, i uh i got this from, class i mean you this you can make a sentence somewhat, i think there's some range on this you know, i didn't make (the sentence) but anyway, the way uh he wrapped it up was uh can you repeat (that?) there is  right so what he did uh yeah, he wrapped up all the axioms into one fact. which is that the fact that, there is something of which i am aware. um, but anyway, he also put in that the foundation of knowledge, part, and the fact that it's self-evident, and the fact that it's inescapable. so this study guide has all these answers too? no this was in my that, UPAR class i took. oh tha- was that Lormand's class? no this is um, through the A-R-I. oh so, seven we, kind of, touched on. yeah, (xx) is there something more specific that you wanted? no, that's good. alright, eight. i think we oh no this one is different implicit i have to use the bathroom. get (xx) going on this.   can we have unconscious knowledge? hm well i yeah you could definitely have impl- you can have unconscious, um, memory i mean. that's what priming, priming studies were based on,  (yeah that's right) well with the, i i'm pretty sure what she meant, it was, or he meant, he means is that, and i could, there's a section here but, um, is that implicit, that okay um i don't know i'm not i'm not sure that, saying this implicit thing adds anything to, the other stuff the fundamental (xx) no do- i it's just something she keeps   yeah here's what i think it means. mhm yeah i feel as though they're saying okay i just didn't randomly pick these like these are what actually, these are what your cognition actually depends on, (xx) yeah you know, i think you're right about, this, what actually what i wrote here but, actually she does talk about implicit, knowledge or something later on and that's maybe where, this is what, my answer does not connect with, this question though i think your answer's better. i th- mean (it sorta) means that... like it's like when you're doing it it's like, you're also assuming these but you're not, you haven't named it? or  yeah yeah (nine) number nine. (this one)?    i thought consciousness was second. yeah consciousness is last, but i ne- i didn't see where she said tha- he said anything about um, i assume that means identity's in the middle but, i didn't see where he explicitly said the identity parts the second. right?   no i know okay this is going on implicitly on what i was, my version of what i was saying implicitly meant. which was saying that, okay forget  right yeah and then then they're conscious of that and then they, well no  right last, because, they come to know what consciousness is, only once they know causality supposedly. so,  so how do you reconcile this with like, i mean doesn't she say that uh the existence and the identity are just two different ways of saying, two different perspectives on one thing? so that how could you have, how could you have to have one before the other if that's the case? like how could a child implicitly have, know the existence axiom, before  no but that's why i'm tryin- that's maybe why i made th- tried to make more implicit than that was that, okay, if a child, could re- reflect on what he's been, perceiving, mhm   cuz they couldn't come to the, explicit knowledge of,  right, yeah i don't know yeah i don't know if, i mean what is it meant to be_ i just don't understand (xx) yeah i the identity, axiom, depends on yeah    you have no memory of your sensation? that's what, according to the way they do it they say, it's just a fleeting buzzing you know that, it's i- there it's gone it's a it's a immediate. where not like us where supposedly we can process it and we can hold, the whole object. oh so it  i guess yeah. okay yep you wanna try the, next one? actually don't, you don't have this book (right?) i don't know if you might be able to answer this without without what? um, another book that, i have.   they do?  an entity... well it's just something, yeah  precise  yeah i know what do you mean by   right and what he says in here is that, primarily he's talking about, um, no this is also things that can be  but they're_ we're not_ we can't perceive, subatomic. right but they're still an entity. yeah but only in the sense that it's been derived through knowledge. right of,  relatively big things. yeah i like his da- his definition better then entities are just, things.     oh so like,   so like um,   wait wait wait, what's mental entity then? well okay a mental i mean what's, what's the example from that which may not be an entity. well we said like subatomic particle in the strict sense but not in the (sense that) (xx) okay it would though she would say, Rand would say it is. okay   maybe i thought when we were do- i, did they,  well, that's where (xx) okay, but let's let's simplify. this, what um, okay what's important here, is the that we are just talking about, individual things they can be subatomic they can be mental, okay they can be groups of other entities. yeah they can be groups, that's what's important. okay mhm okay i know somebody i think in the appendix to, introduction to I-O-E, i think somebody asks (like the) question, you know i (xx) she goes in, mhm  yeah. and she talks about mental entities.  and like okay you can go (xx) this time alright, this is the law of causality... law of identity applied to action. yeah yeah that's that's the yeah that's the law of causality. every action has a cause doesn't it? (that's the,)  yeah that's right that's not, strictly it that's like the cause and effect, description or something.  the law of causality well, maybe it's the same thing. but i know when they s- when he says it in here, it's essentially it's the entity stacked in accordance with their identity so maybe that (is the) same thing. well, it's different things at least different perspectives on the    yeah i was just gonna say that okay, there you go that's, but then there's an action underlying that though. yeah if it was changing its odor it needed to be molding or something (like and   shine a different light on it and it will change its color, without moving.   no this one i think,  well a so i would say, h- a human brain in a certain state, um, is gonna, is gonna give rise to an- another, state. you know for example, ultimately motor, you know something motor. and it's, you put that brain in the same state and it's gonna do the same exact, thing resulting in the same, motor, neuron activity and resulting in the same movement. again so, how's it consistent with volition? well     no here's the thing is, uh, i mean this is just this is not consistent, with, uh volition as  yeah even in the same circumstances, right   it is  oh m- it's a trick question. not really it's just it was a straight question, okay how if at all okay sorry, yeah   so it's not consistent. yeah if you  yeah  mhm, he has to make a choice you could say that. a man under the same circumstances would have to make a choice but, that's not really what this is saying this is saying that we have to perform, or do more than just make a choice you'd have to act on a certain (xx)    i, so, w- what does objectivism say about volition it says that every every every individual has, uh volition? is that, what humans     but you can chose to be irrational. i- yeah   exactly     no i think i think the discrepancy is that you said, man has the ability to chose an irrational position. this statement is not denying it says will perform the same action. it doesn't say can perform a different action. the question is whether choice, ch- real choice is possible at all. choice being something that could've been otherwise, and  no not i'm not really un- understanding where you're  according to objectivism a volitional choice a free choice, uhuh  right    mhm  okay okay yeah,   cuz i- cuz those are circumstances that are important to my point. oh she's saying in certain circumstances, you're you're trying to say in certain circumstances, the person will will choose always one, yeah yeah, yeah,  will perform, okay i you know i interpret okay so you're just saying that, but free will says that yeah    okay i mean,   i don't understand       it's she's saying that you can still have free will, uhuh   oh and this i- but (then) my point is that this is in no way saying that they don't exist independent, of, circumstances. this is not saying the word, cannot chose a different action. right that's what oh that you, the question? yeah the no the s- the the quotation in it, you're reading it in my opinion to say,   but you're already  no but,       well but you said before that it did- it it wasn't consistent,    cuz apparently i'm disagreeing with like every scholar in objectivism so don't listen to me but like i think that who cares i mean it doesn't matter i mean they could be all be wrong. you know what i mean. so forty thousand objectivists could be     in the context though i do think that he needs, that i think that, he's trying to just make the point that like a balloon, that's has sand in it, is gonna, always fall, if they're on earth, with the same temperature all that stuff. yeah so he's excluding mankind, in this example? i think so i think he really just meant that he's talking about,  well if he's excluding mankind then of course it's consistent with volition cuz, volition only applies to mankind      well anyway let's let's move on let's move on. this, it's just to show you know, yeah no no i know  but this isn't a pr- also though th- i don't think this is like detrimental t- lethal to objectivism this little, i mean this inconsistency. if you it's lethal to, the objectivist view. on, it's, yeah s-       right yeah yeah (xx) you know miss. okay, alright but isn't man a, man's an entity so yeah oh and put it this way right. does, does the fact that man has volition, does that, go against the law of causality? now, see the thing is, the law of causality is that entities act in accordance with their identity, you see. and uh, and humans choose, according because they have, volition. that's part of their identity. ah yeah but i mean   well i mean if it's part of    because then if it's like,  yeah yeah you think it is. so the person could act, a person could act, yeah either or i- to have two different actions under the same, scenario and you're thinking that could go against the law, yeah  yeah it does... let's call Leonard and take him   i think the, it's not, this the volition is not fundamental to the philosophy. i th- and we talked about last with John that there's, i- there's a metaphysical issue and a and a epistemological, issue and if we just consider volition in its epistemological sense, and not give into the metaphysics of it, then, no, but let's just  yeah  why? yeah   well there's other reasons, for putting people in jail    be- because of the laws of like conditioning and you know stuff like that. because it's not it doesn't mean that he's gonna do whatever he's going to do no matter what. it means, he's going to do what he's going to do, in certain circumstances so, punishing him is a circumstance that contributes to what he's gonna do. here Rob let that go from,    yes. i wanna look at, the identity well then how can you change the circumstances?      that's why i'm trying to i'm trying to see, let's do let's go away from that  that works is it i think it's pa- i think it's, the same as saying, like if you start your argument with, in logic P and not P, then you can prove, just using the laws of logic if if you start with a contradiction, you can prove anything you want. so it, if you start with     so you're saying Erik was wrong earlier when he said, anything with, yeah i didn't think (xx) it, certainly not must have. it's right? i think something like two or more that's what she's saying you're         yeah that's what i s-  so it doesn't exist. but   yeah it's not self-contradictory, it's just a okay yeah i'll,   how was your mathematical thing? not to have two or more characteristics i i some- a something can have two or more characteristics but yeah i'm not saying that   well i th-   oh you are? yeah, let's say that the characteristics are contradictory right? well then okay how do you do it then? so, i have P and not P, and P is a characteristic right? so you have to find in order to d- or in order to say that there's, some- something with two, contradictory characteristics does not exist, you would have to agree with the following. there exists an X_ i've never taken a logic class isn't this great? there exists an X, such that, uh, there is something, there exists an X, with two characteri- i did it really well before. yeah, (xx)   that it's, no there exists something that has two characteristics, but if you take either characteristic away, yeah   yeah, what was it again?           yeah that's true yeah, so so that's logically impossible. why is that impossible? that it that it ha- it gains something by taking away that exact same thing? gains something by  (xx) no no why a- what's wrong,   i think the problem is is that you're coming into the argument, stating a contradiction. and like you said earlier that's logically you can't do that.  you can't even  but i mean you're saying, you're saying that, s- start  mhm  yeah that's true. you can't even say anything about,  but but you can't just assume, you can't, that's your assumption right that's y- that's your theory that if it has two contradictory characteristics then it's not, i- then it doesn't exist. yeah    no i mean sweet lord God okay. i mean i 	1
LAB500SU089.json	okay thanks, um so this should be kinda cool, um, and to confound things i am really high on cough syrup, so um, neato you have to do randomization you have to do some type of randomization. right. so what might be making a difference is that, the two conditions are different for more than just, relatedness and unrelatedness. it t- might turn out that the first fifty people are more highly motivated. or that the, first fifty people are better readers. and that, you know there was a sign up there and they so they read it first so they signed up first or something. if you don't, if you don't remove the systematicity, between the conditions that isn't, part of your independent variable, you can't be sure that it's your independent variable that's making a difference. so the goal is that, you wanna try to remove the possibility of confounds, of other, variables affecting your independent variable in different ways. you guys should remember stuff about confounds. even though you've been quizzed on it you still have to know this stuff. so, that's internal validity. the next type of validity, is construct validity.  yeah what's the difference between repeated measures and, (xx) repeated measures and within-subjects. um, it's really_ they're really referring to the same thing. um, repeated measures talks about the type of statistical test you do, and within-subjects talks about the design you're doing. so, a within-subjects design means that each subject takes part in every condition, in all the different cells of your design. so you compare each person with themselves. and, when you're running a statistical test, you run a statistical test called a repeated measures ANOVA because each person is measured repeatedly. and so the thing you should remember is that when you when you've got a within-subjects design, you use a repeated measures ANOVA. because between subjects, people don't get measured repeatedly they only get measured once... wait can you say that again? i didn't get it in a between-subjects design, people don't get measured repeatedly. they only get measured, once. so you wouldn't use a repeated measures ANOVA. could you use a between-subjects ANOVA then? you would use_ it's not called a between-subjects ANOVA it's just sort of, it's just called an ANOVA, a one-way or a two-way or a three-way ANOVA. um, and if you've got a mixed design you use a repeated measures ANOVA and you also include some between-subjects variables. you don't have to know too much about it because fortunately we let S-P-S-S do all the hard work. but, the key is that within-subjects there's repeated measures and between-subjects there's not repeated measures... huh? yep? so what's a between-subjects ANOVA? between-subjects ANOVA is just, a regular ANOVA. what's a, crossover interaction? a crossover interaction, uh'oh that's right, we're doing the board. okay, so you have a graph, and we're interested in uh, S-A-T performance. and we're interested in S-A-T performance, let's do something fun. um, of people who became psychology majors versus people who became engineering majors. okay? so, we have our psych majors and we have our engineering majors, and we look at math and verbal scores. and this is score. and, say two hundred, eight hundred. now, we could assume engineering majors because they tend to be, geeky. do we have any engineering majors in here? no no, okay. well then we can make fun of them. um, engineering majors tend to be more math-oriented than psych majors. as a general rule, and of course, you know there are exceptions, but we're gonna pretend that they tend to be more mathematically oriented. n- no come on, with feeling. no good. and, what's going on? the lines cross. what? wait so, all the other interactions we've been doing, if it doesn't cross, it just is an interaction, but if it crosses it's specifically a crossover interaction. right. interactions mean the same thing in s- in the sense that they alw- they always mean that, the effects of one independent variable, affect another independent variable differently. what the differently means, changes based on what the interaction looks like. if it's a crossover interaction, it's sort of, a special kind of interaction because not only is one independent variable affecting the other independent variable, but it's affecting it to the extent that it actually changes the direction of an effect. now that's pretty impressive. i mean most of the time you see that i- you know if if group A does well on a task, uh does better than group B on a task, you know the second task, they both decrease. group A will sor- probably do a little bit better than group B. in this case we're talking about the fact that one group actually does worse in one condition but better in the other condition. it's a much more interesting finding than if the two lines were parallel. does that make sense? mhm  right so, if we have,  mkay, so there are three things that that we look for in a two-by-two, design. one thing you wanna look for is, and we'll call this, I-V one, and this'll be, I-V two. so we look for three things. first of all we wanna know, regardless of, of who's taking the S-A-Ts, we wanna know whether people do better on math or verbal. right? we're, just running a study, we wanna make sure the people who are designing the math section are designing it at, at a similar difficulty to the verbal section, or if we want 'em to be different, do you have a hypothesis that they're different? so, first we say, is does I-V one have a main effect, regardless of anything else going on? and in this case it would, because you'd say that the math, the mean of the math scores is higher than the mean of the verbal scores. so the marginal means are different. then you wanna know, regardless of what part they're taking, overall on the S-A-Ts, do psych people do better than engineering people? and in this case you'd say, there's a main effect for independent variable two, right? because psych people do better than engineering people. but, we could've run two separate studies and found those things and you know it would have been woo hoo big deal. the big question is, is there s- is there something else going on? and what you're saying is, if there's two parallel lines, well they're both being affected, so isn't there shouldn't there be some type of interaction? and, what we do is we look to see, if we just ran the study only on engineering people, we'd see a study we'd say okay look see, verbal you do worse than on math. and if we ran it just on, psych people, we get rid of the verbal peop- the engineering people, we'd say the same thing, right? but we'd say oh you know psych people do better than verbal people, than engineering people. but... if we look at whether the lines are parallel, whether, the decrease as you go to verbal, is the same or different for the two groups, you you learn something about whether the two groups are different in more than just the sort of, overall way. and, if they're parallel, what you're saying is that this independent variable is affecting psych people and engineering people in exactly the same way. we don't we don't see anything that that is any more interesting than the fact that psych people and engineering people are different and math and verbal are different. mkay but if they're not parallel yes, thanks. oh, okay. other questions? yeah? but that wouldn't be a crossover interaction? right this would not be a crossover interaction. because the_ even if this isn't significantly different, the fact is that this solid line never goes below the but if it_ can't you just follow that it would?  oh (all right) what's an interpretation? what's what? an in- interpretation? an interpretation, where on the list is that? oh is it just stuff like your test results yeah oh and interpreting is sort of the ability to interpret statistics or graphs. you should understand, how to interpret things. so, if i give you a graph, that looks like this, you have to be able to tell me if there's, a main effect for um, for field of study a main effect for, test type and if there's an interaction between the two. also if i give you, um the results of an S-P-S-S ANOVA output, you have to tell me whether there're main effects or interactions and_ or what the P values are. this is a minor question. um, when you look at the ANOVA, um i think when we did it, the lab in class you said there was that the residual was another word for between-subjects mhm okay so when you see a residual, you should think of it_ it it's a little it's basically saying the stuff you can't explain. if you're doing between-subjects ANOVA that means it's the within-subject stuff. if you're doing a within-subjects ANOVA it's the between stuff. okay  okay could you do, an example of that? sure. so, instead of math and verbal, we'll now pretend instead of the S-A-Ts it's the G-R-Es. so, we'll add, just check the, marginal means for each of the gr- groups okay for which groups do we check the marginal means for? for the the the bottom and compare. okay, so we check the marginal means of math versus analytic versus verbal. so, the average of these two points, of these two points, and of these two points. and let's say that we find that, analytic and verbal, are different. so, our, our ANOVA would say that there is a main effect for independent variable one. we'd have to run some post hoc tests to find any- to find out where the differences are. but we would know that somewhere in here there's a pair of things, that are different... okay. what about for independent variable two? how would we find out, if there's a significant main effect? you add up their scores. what's that? you add up their scores add up which scores? combined scores (xx) okay so the average score, for psychology people and the average score for engineering people. right. it's the_ again, it's just the marginal means. so the marginal means of eight hundred, let's say seven-forty, and three hundred, would be like five-something probably. um and the average of, four hundred, six-fifty and six-fifty, it would be like, five-something also, and if they're significantly different, we say that there's a main effect for, field and if they're not significantly different we say there's no main effect for field. now this is an easy one. is there an interaction? yes. yeah because, the lines are definitely not parallel. and if it turned out that instead of this type of, relationship, if instead we had something that looked like this um, i left mine at home. can you get it to me by the end of the day today? yes, um i have to leave five minutes early i just wanted to talk to you (or) ten minutes early mkay well, you should probably_ uh okay (xx) ten minutes early, (xx) hang out here until, okay, and then two-way, design. oh (i forgot to bring this up.) (two-way design) that's that's (everything else) two-way design means T-tests. independent or matching pair. what's the difference between a T-test and ANOVA? T-test you do when there's only one independent variable. ANOVA you do (when there's others.) okay, so that's two-way design. then there's the factorial design. factorial is ANOVA. (xx) well, any_ ANOVA is more than one kind (xx) what's that? i forgot (the independent) ohh, big points off. yeah it's okay. it's just a rough  can i ask you a question (about this) example? sure. okay. this one, for A, it says that there's only a main effect on the (cartier) variable, okay mhm okay we won't do this together. what they're saying is that (xx) together. so, it was this far apart and you (xx) we won't do something where where there's a difference (xx)  right we'll either state that (the statistic degree) (xx) the (end,) or they'll be touching each other. so the game wasn't even on T-V last night. no but they won. it's r- they did? yeah i heard they were up for like, by a lot actually. yeah, that was nice. (xx) see, good for you. yeah but it wasn't even on the (xx) was on. yeah i know. okay, alright. that's why i was so_ i was c- really confused. yeah, that's a bad example they give. okay, thank you. mhm do you have the quiz from i don't have it with me but if you wanna come up at the end of class i can show you (what your) score (was.) okay how come i (get Indian?) absolute party of (xx) umm (xx) what the fuck is this shit? ooh   you're so smart. that includes web browsers. i feel like (getting church up sad) (it was on accident) they really should have like a switch right here where i can just turn off the internet or something. um, so just before we go into, (xx) stuff, if any of you guys missed Wednesday and didn't get a chance to write up, the, draft of paper four, you should probably talk to me because it's based on an analysis we ran on the data on Wednesday and if, you don't have the data and the outcome you can't write up your, discussion section, and so (i) should talk to (you) at the end of class. um, mkay what we're gonna do, now is i'd like you guys to get into groups of three or four, and um i've got a list of studies, um that've been run, and i think, nearly all of them have actually been published. um and, your job is to find some confounds, in these studies. every study has at least one confound, um, this is the fun part where you get to sort of tear other people's work apart. (because) um, as a psychologist other people tear your work apart all the time so it feels kinda good to find faults with other people. so if you guys can get into groups, and go through these, then we'll talk about 'em whatever i'll take care of this later. i haven't even read it yet. oh i thought you were i know.  i don't know what to do can_ the confounds, yeah like you know (i was just) (xx) is there just one sheet? yep (Aaron) why don't you pass it around (xx)  okay. um yeah what are confounds? like (xx) like a third variable that could affect (things) right. okay. umm... whether the person was a, a boy or a girl? how many boys and how many girls but it's not or is that irrelevant? yeah that that's not_ confound is like, like what   but it's not. even for female raters. oh, okay... oh even okay so (xx) um, length of essay? maybe all the guys, why they would rate higher for shorter, and the guys all rate shorter cuz they're not like, they don't elaborate as much, that could be... like guys in general don't (xx) yeah maybe if they didn't elaborate enough well what else (xx) um, handwriting. if they were typed or, cuz maybe they weren't rated (xx) handwriting. but why would they rate,    who knows? couldn't it be like something just, like, something like that? i mean isn't that what he's looking for?  the first thing, i_ well i said typed and written. guys type their papers cuz they're sloppier, writing and so it  yeah cuz if you were to read a paper and one was typed and one was (xx) handwritten you would assume that the one typed was better. more effort and stuff  okay (xx) like something like, um, boys typed, they had worse handwriting  um in this particular case they're they're, written in the same way. oh    um,   okay so you can assume that that the only things that's that, are different in the two conditions are whether they see the name John Smith or Jane Smith on the top. okay. oh in the name?   the interest was whether there was bias (for) to male or female names. there obviously  yeah that  that   this happens to be one of the hardest ones so if you're, if you're finding that you can't do it you might wanna move on and, go back to it to (xx) second one (xx) you guys (xx) (xx) maybe just the teacher is more qualified. (xx) yeah (xx) what was_ what'd you guys say? like the teachers are more qualified (and) teach better or the students could be smarter. whatever. either one. but also (he) found their scores were closer so, (xx) so (xx) (xx) so would that be external (validity) (xx) alright, can you think of any con- read in your head sorry. so, did you read? yeah i read it. so basically they just changed the author's, right the only thing i could think is_ but the see i don't know it's (relevant that) whole thing like even (for) female writers but it's the only thing i can think of that would be a confound is like what if there're more females reading, the male papers? something like that you know? or vice versa. could something be that's confounded is the type of of material they're reading too? uh'uh cuz the it's oh, identical  yeah (xx)  he said there's at least one for each  yeah. (i tell you what) you wanna skip it and come back to it? let's come i know oh this is dumb it like it_ what's confounded is the the subject  yeah, the engineers versus, psych people yeah. and then actually that also means um, different type of professors are teaching too. that's true. also just and  well that's the point they're trying to find out if it's the material makes the difference. so you have to vary the material. oh okay i see what you're saying. so did_ but, the professors are different, the people they're teaching are different that's enough.  yeah. hm, that's interesting... what? that they received an electric shock when they're wrong  well_ oh, the confounding variable is the dropout rate. yeah that's what i was gonna say, dropout. what is th- what is that called again? i don't know  it's from like_ no i think it's (just) this one... attrition. yeah, attri- subject attrition. ahh  it's okay yeah subject attrition. um Dan? yep? if something affects both groups equally, like it's anoth- if it's another variable that's out there but affects them equally then it's not a really confounding variable  so for example like in our, in that thing that we turned in today, mhm mhm right right. beca- everybody saw all the same words in some_ in one of the conditions, because, there were there were four lists of words. yeah okay. yeah okay.  i just got three emails in the last three minutes. does that mean that does that mean we did it wrong? (xx) (assignment?) what? (do you think we did our) homework assignment wrong? i dunno. i just gotta tell her i can't talk to her right now. yeah. okay so there's attrition, okay i'll do the next one. whatever. okay. (xx) (reactivity) doctor noun whoa. whoa. yeah, well mayb- (got it,) well the point is that men supposedly work better under pressure than women. no but the_ he's not testing that he's testing, creativity. right, so that could be a found- so that could be a confounding   i don't know if he phrases it that way (xx) hold on. i have to read this again. i have to tell her really quick or else gonna it's gonna get it's this is the  you're just gonna ditch her? no i have to, i can't, i just couldn't do it in that screen. there.  so now she logged off, finally. (i don't want a girlfriend) (xx) okay. so what do you think for that one? that's that that could be confounded. (is that_) bu- but even, but even so Sarah, do you notice that, look how f- look how the difference in scores     that's what it is. you're right. (xx) (xx) well maybe the new list of words really did have more annoying words. and maybe they, maybe they just... that's not, yeah and that's not true. wait a minute. it's true... what? i think it's that the new list of words may be less likable. yeah they could be they could be completely different. exactly. (block out the) (xx) is that you beeping there? no the only ones_ Nina and you and this computer just doesn't beep. (xx) zero this is actually true...  you know what in the blizzard of seventy_ they had a blizzard in s- nineteen seventy-eight in Ma- in like Massachusetts, mhm okay.     alright.  following (ideas) what was that?      i don't um there has to be something going on in here that we haven't (quite) picked up  it has something to do with the days of the week i think. well they didn't say what day of the week, the, the black guy was. right.  i was born on a Monday. my mom was in labor with me on Friday the thirteenth.   come on, i have  no after thirty-eight hours? uhuh. it was well you know when like from when the first contraction started, it was  yeah,  oh really. that's why i'm always worried cuz that stuff's genetic, like you inherit that stuff. like, if your mother's in, like (xx) you will be too i'm like great, i'm gonna be in labor  oh God don't say that. okay, let's talk about, what's wrong with these studies. hopefully everybody's done at least i'm guessing since everybody's talking more loudly (xx) excited. so, people like the letters O and H better than A and B. O and H might be liked better than A and B. okay and  what? well in this example you have John and Jane. okay those are just two examples. what they actually did is they used just a whole bunch of names and the masculine and feminine forms of each. hm yeah? we uh, talked about the essay material, the material was something that was more stereotypically male like sports, it might be more apt to, (agree with the) male versus the female okay so, if if the material was such that people thought male as opposed to female, that would be, um a weakness of the study but it wouldn't necessarily be a confound. because it wouldn't be affecting one group and not the other group. oh maybe males are more critical, than females, and, they uh,  so, so, the the fact that both males and females scored males higher than females... you're saying if if if by difference between males and females are you talking about the difference between the, essay writers or the judges? the judges okay so they're they're, if if we found the difference between male and female scores, like the the male judge scores and the female judge scores, we, we would say that that could be a problem or that could be an effect that we're interested in finding. in this particular case we're gonna assume that the scores were both the same. males scored males higher and females scored males higher... other possible ideas for what the confound is? could it also be, it depends on like the students that are evaluating it, like what what their back- what their background is, like if you have, males, and females that are all the same discipline and all, like from the same area that's (xx) that they'll both be different, if you take male engineers and female  so one thing you wanna make sure of is that you have, um a random assignment to to conditions you wanna randomly select males and females from the same population, and if you didn't do that, that could be a confound. good. other, other confounds with (the actual) materials? hm  kids who take an engineering class are just better at like, statistics or had some more previous knowledge, so they scored higher. okay so that engineering students are just different than psych students and they're better at statistics. yeah  the um, the people who dropped out were the ones who had the low scores, because they would get shocked a lot mkay okay so su- so subjects in the shocking condition dropped out more like, more frequently than subjects in the non-shocking condition. and what'd we call that? subject attrition subject attrition right. so, if you don't know what the difference between the people who dropped out and the people who stayed in is, you can't make the assumption that that, they're the groups are actually different it might be all the wimps in one group dropped out and the wimps in the other group stayed. (xx) yeah? could you also say that there's not, that the punishment versus reward isn't equal? like you can't compare getting shocked to getting a dime. right, it might be that punishment and reward aren't equal. the shock might not be exactly ten cents worth of shock. men might be more familiar with things to do with an army compass and a monkey wrench than women. okay, so it might be that the the objects are more masculine than, feminine. yeah? and, he's just testing creativity, but then he brings in pressure (and that,) which is another independent variable. so there may be some sort of interaction. right now that's not necessarily a confound that's actually a good thing right? why, if he's only testing for creativity? um, he's testing for creativity and he's testing for, creativity under pressure. it doesn't say that well, by including another independent variable that's essentially what he's doing, but, if he just uses the marginal means, of the high and low pressure in those situations, you should be able to tell the difference between males and females regardless of time pressure. right? mhm um, it's not like, okay right so there may be, an external or ecological validity issue um, certainly yeah if, you know, if creativity has nothing to do with, (u-) uses for a monkey wrench, then, then you don't really have, much validity. good. um,    this is a pretty dumb study yeah, despite the (xx) kind of a dumb study, so what's wrong with it? (xx) (xx) (here?) well first of all the, the first list of words could've had like more positive connotations, or, better related to, and then like the second list of words could be words that they didn't even know, and stuff_ it didn't say what kind of, what like_ did they match the words to see if they were like same, like difficulty level and length and all that stuff? mm okay now since the task was to, to judge the words from the first list, that everybody saw, how would you think that the differences in the second list would make a difference?   mkay but, (what) i'm not sure is wha- wh- where what's causing the effect? so right before you make the judgment of the first list of words, of whether they're positive or negative, you see a se- either a new list of words that are different, or you see that same first list. and you do be- and you rate the first list better. (xx) the first list what's that? there's nothing to compare to if you see the first list again. okay so maybe you have to think (xx) compare (xx) (you'd) sort of just judge 'em all positive. well, but didn't you say like you see a list and you s- might see the same list again and you decide whether you like those words? so, so what he's trying to show_ what this th- th- this_ was was he did a bunch of studies, in addition to this one some of 'em were better than others. in one, in one case he used subliminal presentation, and what he would do is people would be looking at a screen, and he would subliminally present, shapes, unusual shapes, not necessarily squares and circles but unusual shapes. and then, they didn't know that they saw these things and the- they were looking at them for like a millisecond, so it was way too, fast to even recognize that you saw something. and then later on you would give 'em a big, list of shapes and ask them to rate how positively or negatively they felt. and, what he found was that, um... it also seems like well even outside of that like, a week has passed between them and so, there's all kind of things that can affect how you feel about a certain, group of words or even just, like what? right, would you think that that, that the mood would, differ between people who saw the same list twice and the people who saw, two different lists? the second list might put people in the bad mood. right right. maybe reading the second list does something to people, that, reading the first list doesn't do to them. so it might be for example that, if the second list includes some negative words people might be in a bad mood, and in a bad mood they might rate everything lower. so, that might be what's causing the problem. um, so it's kind of what you're saying is the idea that they might be in a different mood, but y- what you need to be able to say is that, something in one condition caused their moods to change differently than in the other condition. mkay? so let's talk about blackout babies have any of you guys ever heard that, about after a blackout there's, a rise in births? so, what's wrong with that? yeah? (if you look at the, the results and then you might be saying) (xx) so, y- you're saying that that, (it just might be, it just might happen that they might just have decided on Monday or Tuesday.) so it might not be nine months after it might be Monday Tuesday. right. um i also don't (xx) okay right, so, so rather than looking at Monday and Tuesday you're saying, to say take the the week before and the week after the date, nine months later than the date, compare that to other times that (xx) (xx) correct. right. now now part of that is, part of this is is good the fact the_ in fact it turns out that um, there's about a week a standard deviation of uh, of birth is, is about a week in either direction, so there's nine months then plus or minus is a week. (so you can see what these are) so, getting getting a bigger picture would be better. but, you could imagine if, that standard deviation occurred all the time, the year before the same type of standard deviation occurred. um and it wasn't you know there weren't as many  but there there weren't? couldn't it just be that, on that Monday of that particular week they were like so much higher than all the Mondays on the rest of the year? the- or they didn't find that? it it could have been, if if that were the case. right you would effect_ you you would expect that there were a main effect, of that year versus other years, (you're assuming that that was your particular interest,) if there were a main effect, you might expect this. it's due April seventeenth right? yeah it's due at the end of the semester. but there're different things going, going on between, now and then. um, the key that you should keep in mind is that you can work with a partner, in groups of up to two no more than two, and, um, if you work with a partner you guys can both run the same study and everything and you do it all together but you have to write up separate papers. and, your grade isn't based on whether you find significance it's based on, how you, can present the data and, how you um, how you run your analysis and how you basically show that you understand all the stuff we've talked about this semester. now fortunately, during the whole semester, you guys have gone through, all the different parts of, writing a paper so this shouldn't be too difficult. you've written, an intro, a methods, a results, and a discussion section, so you can look back at those and and, and directions that we've given you throughout, throughout the semester. so, start thinking about ideas, start thinking about partnering up if you want, um and starting next class we'll we'll get into, more depth as far as what your projects are gonna (be like.) so, for those of you who haven't handed in, your assignment four and you need help doing the analysis stay here for a little bit, otherwise i'll talk to you Monday. that's it. hm. so you were saying you're studying a lot for the drugs exam? like you wouldn't believe. i've read over my notes three times_ no, o- i've read 'em over t- twice,  but i feel like i don't even know exactly what he wants us to memorize. like, do we need to know every  yeah   they do? mm  well they're all self-administered except for hall- L-S-D isn't  but i mean  for sure. you know what? i actually, when i was talking to Michelle last week i asked her you know about that whole thing about_ cuz remember the part where you ha- it says write two important factors about each thing? and no one knows what the two factors they want you to write are? what are you talking about? she said that? remember the part, no remember the part of the exam that says write    and how we were like you know, how do you know if they can (xx) you can argue it. well see that's the thing, they don't show us our exam.  you can go back i checked it. yeah, i looked i saw mine. um, but anyways so  do you wanna go get yogurt?   i'm sorry oh that's okay oh it's about peer evals i'm just tired not important. well, whatever that's not about us. i'm gonna write her back (xx) why are you writing her back? we don't have peer evals. 	1
COL575MX055.json	good evening and thank you for joining us. my name is Stephanie Lovinger, and i am the chair of SHOUT. on behalf of the Students Honoring Outstanding University Teaching, it is g- with great pleasure that i welcome you here tonight, to present the nineteen ninety-nine Golden Apple Award. the concept of the Golden Apple Award began nine years ago, and was inspired by (ni-) Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurkanos, who taught, when i received the award in nineteen ninety-three i was permitted to talk as long as i wanted to, uh but i was advised to be brief, uh this evening and i will be brief difficult as that is for a professor or at least for this professor. thank you Professor Fine. thank you Professor Fine. we, the Students Honoring Outstanding University Teaching, would now like to invite Dr Brenda Gunderson to the stage to receive her award, and present her ideal last lecture A Paradox a Penny and a Performance. thank you five hundred five hundred. good. drug B drug B. okay. drug B appears to be the better drug but, you know that's not the end of the story we need to look a little closer. and it turns out there was actually two hospitals, behind the study. two hospitals, were used. and we're gonna look at the same results, for those two hospitals. now first verify for me that, if you take these two sets of data here these two tables and put 'em back together, you're gonna get the overall total. right? the nine hundred that improved under drug A here and five-ten gives us our, six hundred over there. so these two tables combined do give us the results, in our aggregate. what about drug A? how do we do here, what, proportion of patients improved, under drug A at hospital one? what is it, ninety out of a hundred or? ninety percent. ninety percent. what is that proportion for drug B, at hospital one? eighty-six eighty-six percent. which one seems to be the winner here? drug A. how 'bout over at hospital two, five hundred and ten out of a thousand so, an improvement rate here of? fifty-one fifty-one percent, B has only? forty percent forty percent. the winner again, drug A. how can drug A be the winner, at each hospital? you take that data and put it together and overall you get that drug B, is the winner. seems to be a paradox. closer look. look at the rates for hospital one versus hospital two. which hospital would you want to be treated at if you had to be treated for this disease? hospital one would you want to go to hospital one or hospital two? one one. it has the higher rates of improvement overall. altho- now that might be because, maybe the patients that were initially better, initial health status was better, were sent to hospital one. maybe those that were a little poorer, status were sent to hospital two, cuz maybe hospital two had the facilities to, handle those kind of patients if something should go wrong. drug A was a little bit better than B overall, at each hospital. but what happened? hospital one had initially the better patients. which drug was primarily used at hospital one? drug      one one. i need one person please. ten ten percent. ten percent of ninety-nine is about? ten ten. i need ten more people. you wanna come, come on. (i'm an N-D) you're an N-D. (xx) i need one more. there's someone back here there's someone back here? good. alright. look at all these people that tested positive. alright. eleven of them altogether. how many of them actually have the disease? one one. what's one out of eleven?   yeah (xx) okay, we've got a couple more? there was a big box of them outside. anyone else need one? they'll bring a few more in... lemme explain the activity while they're doing that. what i'm gonna have you do in a moment is just write your name. i'm gonna have you print, your name but don't do it yet, cuz we're all gonna do it together. (no nope) nope, we'll hold on for a little bit... alright three, two, one, go is everybody done? no did you print your name? okay alright. you got your time written down? we're gonna repeat, that, task again but switch hands. opposite hand. opposite hand. no it's taking longer. yes now? alright... you have your two times. what i want you to do now, is determine how much longer it took you to print your name with your opposite hand. work out that difference. how much longer. write that number down and circle it... and then, you may or may not know the person, next to you or behind you i want you to introduce yourself to them, i want you to share your numbers get a couple, items of data here gather some data from those around you, and see what kind of results you're getting. do that right now (xx) okay you've gathered some data. i have a theory, and i would like to help help y- have your help assessing whether we should stay with this theory, or whether we should reject it. and the theory is, on average, it takes a person three seconds longer, to print their name with their opposite hand. right here fifty percent fifty percent one-half. alright we might talk a little bit then about probability, about how it's defined and so forth, what if we took the penny and stood it on a table on edge, and you can actually do this it works better, when Lincoln's head is down, see, and then you, hit the table, hard enough to cause it to go one way or the other. now what's the chance of getting a heads? is it gonna be one-half? we don't know for sure do we? what do we do? talk about the fact that that would be, a random experiment with two outcomes head or tail but we don't know yet what's gonna happen, until you do it. we would repeat that experiment many times, and look at the proportion of heads in the long run, that turned out, of that experiment. and use that as our estimate of that chance, or probability. i (am gonna share) one more student story with you, she may actually be here tonight, she was in my class five years ago. took my Stat four-oh-two class. and she said aw thank you so much Dr Gunderson. um, i would like to take this time to thank our sponsors listed on the back of the program, um, thank my committee for helping me so much and everyone at Hillel that did everything for us, um, we really appreciate it. um, thank you all for joining us this evening is_ if anyone's interested in purchasing a video, on the back of your program there's a form that you can mail in. um thank you and have a wonderful evening. 	1
OFC578SG037.json	what about the third? oh i'm sorry (xx)    okay and these are it feels to me like this, sentence should come first... you know,  okay that's fine, put that yeah put that (in parentheses i'll move that up too no problem) mkay okay the task committee? mhm would you say the task  the committee  geofluvial, model. that's a type of model it's a geof- the two models are extremal hypothesis or geofluvial. so i can put the word model, after each of 'em,  okay i got_ that's that's okay yeah oh yeah   i actually wanna change that. okay so we don't okay and it's not as attractive because, with the advancement of computer capabilities allow us, (xx) cuz i mean, we don't_ the extremal hypothesis model doesn't, predict anything with time. so the computer models allow us, to predict things with time  yeah right here   okay mhm yeah (xx) mhm yeah mhm  okay, so, again, i think_ like i said, the lectures this week are really critical for you. um, okay now we m- move on to the geofluvial model.      um what  speed. (xx) i mean just speed allows the model to do   okay but you're using that as a tool to get, what you want. mhm  to a better model, i mean to a to a better_ and why d- why is this a better model it gives you, something, what does it give you? what is_ is   okay    when i when i see a phrase like um,    right so but still_ yeah that's the details of what? of how they're more sophisticated. yeah but what's the end  predicts, river bank erosion. okay i mean, pretty much the the end product is a a model that will allow you to predict, river bank erosion, essentially. by including all these different processes.  yeah yeah okay  is is that the main, thing is that it's more accurate? not just accurate it's also more uh, it's also, faster. i mean, the solution is  mhm right i mean that's the ultimate goal okay so so this is i mean a- a- accuracy is the ultimate goal i mean it_ they're willing to sacrifice time, for accuracy, but there reaches a point where, time does become an issue because you know no one wants to wait a month before seeing, the results. mhm mhm    no   that's okay that's alright?  okay, it seems pretty long. alright. i think it's just, fine. okay uh you could connect these two sentences with a semicolon. okay because they're_ if you wanted to but a period's fine too. um, okay i wanted to  mhm   mm it's in here mhm na- nothing? no you just changed that? okay yeah mhm well mkay mhm mhm yup  i'm done completely with the  but they're... there's actually  yeah b- yeah it's a g- it's part  oh great  okay, but, uh the task committee did review this  yes. i i_ mkay mhm yeah,   so, you know that the Kovacs-Parker, is, a, good solution. yes right? but, you wanna make it better? oh yeah, i- i- it's deficient in quite a few ways so, your research objective is to improve, on, the Kovacs, Parker model yup and do you say that anywhere, exactly? mhm, well so, so  got it   well, yeah yeah   okay     i think this is perfect the way it said it right here, is to address  but i- should i_ you're s- you're, commenting on it being buried in the third paragraph right hm i mean i could move that, sentence, up here but i can't leave the rest  okay so how 'bout, we do something like you know what?  okay okay oh, a little bit, not too much that would be really helpful, uh whe- when is it due? what? the  mm there is no diagram due. oh that's not? really...? hm... um okay, so no  oh i don't think i'll have a problem with it it just_ i don't know there's other things i'm just working on right now. yeah? but well the, the one thing i was thinking of if i go into the node diagram, mhm  oh cuz i_ cuz if i use the node diagram as an introduction then i really  no all_ it's it's uh as, just, almost like an an alternative to an outline. where you, um, you see, the flow, from the problem statement, to, s- n- suggested well the, the problem_  well you can do it that mhm right well sh- i well     i mean yeah you could have river bank erosion, and then there are f- the fi- i mean i could you know okay mhm mhm over_ another_ i just wanna talk in general, um, overall, i i feel like you're, um, u- um, using different terms, for the same, thing and i feel like they're not fully defined mhm well there's_ yeah that's one of the problems though, unlike a lot of other, unlike a lot of other, disciplines mhm mhm  and that's one mhm  channel okay  okay okay great    okay what what are some other types of channel morphology? (i don't know) i okay,    so another one that you (interested in) is longitudinal direction change. right. okay, and you're gonna be talking about_ and that's different than river bank erosion? right,  mkay i i would, i really would like to see you, sure okay  yeah, oh sorry sorry um, but uh, yeah but i could take it back that far i guess i um you know maybe after i do that i'll see how i might work it in can i have the, the front page, too? here? yup yeah   uh yeah i i might go, i mean if i can take it back there it's, uh, i don't we_ yeah i'll think about how i wanna try and do that. i have i've already thought i hope you'll be inspired  yeah right yeah  i'm hoping we'll really take off next week and i hope that, i- lectures today are inspirational just, if you think what does it have to do with me?  no i don't need it actually okay, um... yeah. okay, thanks a lot i appreciate it. okay, see you next week. hey thanks for doing the recording thing. oh it's not_ no problem at all. 	1
DEF305MX131.json	(i'm) (xx) committee chair for Elizabeth Behenski, and i'm here to announce the, defense of um Beth's, thesis. and um i'd like to share with you something that um Josh Allens said and i think this had to do with completion of dissertations although the exact citation was not, clear. what he said was, thanks Robyn for that introduction. um, guess i hafta, for the first time, yes (you all) can hear me sorry. um, what i wanna start with, i- basically is to say that, you know Robyn has been working in South America for a long time now and um, you know she sorta disappears for a while at a time, and i've gone down with her a couple of times, and one of the things i've noticed is that every time she introduces herself to people down there she says, my name is Robyn, people kinda look at her funny cuz Robyn's not a real common name in, South America and she'll say, you know, like Batman and Robin. oh yay ahh okay. so obviously i cut and paste but i just couldn't resist. before we start questions i just want to remind those of you who may not have heard there's a um, party at my house this evening to um, celebrate Beth's defense and there's maps here it's in town so please take a map and um see us there about seven-thirty. and, does anybody have any questions? (questions?) yes Mark. um you said, you didn't use the, nearest relative, thing because most of 'em weren't identified, for the ones that that you know more particularly what they were did they seem to fit in that they were, typically submontane or they're not that (specific?) what i'll say with this is the the, given the tentative identifications on, on some of them and others that i think are m- are, more robustly identified. it's impossible to really say, that well, they don't contradict, the, temperatures and elevations that i've gotten from the leaf morphology data. the the the problem, i guess you could (that) it's not really a problem but, but the problem with that is that for those, particular um, species and genera, the range of tolerances is pretty broad, and so, so i could say yes they probably did occur in submontane but i can't rule out, that those particular species might have been lowland, and others partic- particular species, um, montane. but in general if you look at the whole, um range of the species that you see, y- you can't say that it wasn't submontane by looking at them. so it, you know... anyone else?  um, (you mean that)   has anybody else calculated, uplift and sort of (timing of) uplift rates for that part of the Andes and how do your rates compare? yes actually they have and using, a bunch of different methods i, s- compiled a database which i didn't show here about thirty different uplift rates that people have done in that region. and one thing you'll notice is that depending on the time period you're looking at you know, like as i did when i calculated the uplift rate only during the sedimentation it was pretty high, and since since the deposition of the basin was low, and those, actually coincide with other, uplift rates that have been calculated throughout that, region during that period. so, tha- it's close. i mean i i- th- it doesn't raise any flags those rates don't raise any flags. yes Gary. was global temperature during the period of uplift that you're looking at, more or less constant so that you can attribute, changes in temperature to changes in elevation? that's an interesting question actually um and a very good one. uh, the estimates, at the equator in those regions in the neotropics, people have suggested that temperature may have changed in that region globally, from the Miocene to today but probably no more than three degrees Celsius. and so, there probably is a component of that, in the in the estimates i'm seeing, um the changes in global temperature. but what i, i will say two things one is the magnitude of the change i'm seeing is much greater than global change, and over a much shorter time period. so that, what i think it is really the change in temperature is primarily due to uplift in that area not necessarily the global change in (rate.) Greg. um, for those of us who've, (xx) spent thirty years living in the world according to Jack Wolfe, it seems like, leaf m- margin analysis is not particularly useful,  i'm  yeah, sorry Bruce. i'm asking about the uh leaf margin analysis that you didn't seem to find as particularly correla- is that, because of a phylogenetic effect, or    i  i- i think actually that they probably are um, mostly reflective of, ta- actual temperature change and i_ and part of the reason is one, they're in similar environments that you would expect the types of species to be in, say, river environments versus um, forest environments to be, similar, of similar morphologic, um composition so i i think, a change in them, that you see, uh might actually reflect changes in the temperatures of those areas. um and, secondly i think that the amount of time that you see in those, in the El Salado member is much greater than you see higher up in the section say in the ash bed sequences and i think, what's happening is you're getting, small amounts of sedimentation or periodic sedimentation all the way through there, so that, so that the amount of time, represented between those layers is, is great, and that you could see indeed, temperature changes through those, that period. anyone else? yes Katherine. um, how i- thinking about um, relativ- about um, submontane forests, that you think might have been the original vegetation here, if you were to look at submontane forest today in South America roughly how many species would you expect to find if you could say census a relatively large area say a couple hundred square kilometers or  how many species, yeah yeah mhm  (okay) if there's no more questions let's thank Beth again and, (take a break) (xx) i have directions here also for those of you who are interested in going to the party (xx) 	1
DIS175SU027.json	 RESTRICTED  uh you never know if, um you know you think you hear one bird and then another one in a different location but you don't know if the bird, just like flew there or what so  depending on how far birds are away they might be out of the habitat or,  mhm  okay so, or even to guess. (xx) um, ho- what would we put this under? in part maybe, you're under skill if the more practice you had you might get better at it, i think even better would be, under study design and, what, we did was we basically had at Riggsville, it's a transect with your points all along here. and you did the same thing at Colonial Point, and, what happened, and i purposely did this, is that you were doing this at a, a tenth of a mile apart. it's too close isn't it? not only is it too close because, we didn't set boundaries, um we didn't set boundaries so that makes it too close it's too close anyway a tenth of a mile, you can hear, the loud calling or singing species. so that was a problem with study design, and um, the other thing, that's problematic, is that you were doing what? you were walking this line and one of the things you worried about as you were pushing those Chipping Sparrows ahead or you were   okay you could, you could make your points further apart, number one, you can also do what about the distance you're collecting data? this is what Mary was worried about too. you can put what? (set)  um, well we didn't have any, set  okay. he was doing something else that i'm going to talk about i was thinking he was doing_ did point count. typically fifty meters is the distance. so that is gonna help you cuz it's gonna rein you in and you don't have to be worried, about overlapping you don't have to be worried about, you know, detecting something at a greater distance. the other thing that is typically done, um with, a, point count, so that you avoid pushing things from wo- you know one station to the next. um let's say out at Riggsville, you know, that we have a specific area that we were wanting to sample. if we looked at aerial photos, and we looked at the diversity of habitat let's say there's forest here and there little wetland over here, and, farm field here, just to make it three simple habitats, you'd wanna be able to, sample these, in proportion to what they, actually occurred in the environment. so if you put_ overlay the grid, over this, you could come up with, you know what percent is wetland what forest and so on. and based on that, the number of sample points that you would want, from each of these, and then on your grid which would be numbered, you could use a, a random numbers table or whatever method, to figure out where you were gonna sample. so let's say there should be two sample points, in the wetland, and maybe four here, and you know, maybe um, four here. so, you would randomize this, and then, you would randomize the time that you visited the order that you visited, so that you're not making a line and pushing things from one place to another, and so that you are, visiting some sites earlier, and then if you come back you switch that order so you visit them later. so there're all these little refinements that you can get into that help, avoid some of these biases. what are some of the_ what are_ you got any other ideas? some birds don't sing as much as others. that's a great one. and another thing is like uh, you know like a, Red-Eyed Vireo you're probably hearing the male singing. so do you count that as one bird or two birds? well if you're if you are, doing a breeding season estimate, you typically would count it as two but you know that you know that might not be accurate. but i told you your assignment was to to, find out what was here, all year round. so let's go back he said behavior of the species some don't sing as often. some have very loud songs that carry tremendously. some are soft. how about something like a night hawk? we typically see those in the evening. how about owls? did we sample owls? no we didn't. ho- um there are some very secretive, uh marsh-dwelling species that don't say much of anything. so we really have, sampled here, to uh, for our convenience. we went there at a time that was convenient for us, we're dealing with species whose song_ we know by song and sight. if we wanted this to be thorough, we'd have to go back at other times and in fact people have, good protocol, for sampling at night, and sampling you know secretive species so you'd have to come up with a list of what all you thought might be there, and say okay is there anything here, that i that i probably didn't get out there this morning or i didn't i didn't uh, um specifically, address the species there because i didn't use th- the right methodology? so that's good. okay anything else? well, there was one bird that we heard like while we were walking, mhm okay well i- i mentioned i forgot to mention that again i said this before, but y- you do on on one of these point counts you_ no matter what happens in-between, they are not included, in the point count. um you, if you have something unusual you probably wanna write it down just because you wanna remember it. and you may and might include that in your report but for the specific analyses, you're only sticking, at the points. just doing the points. but then aren't you not getting a thorough like, thorough, sample of the popula- like i- if um, let's say um there was a Bald Eagle. mhm yeah, cuz when we went out to Colonial Point two years ago it was just raining. yeah yeah so um  for the habitat conditions,  right, goo- that's a real good point uh, what what else is going on, at a particular site? you may not necessarily be in a full wilderness condition. one thing that i was concerned about i've never had this happen before, there was a guy that drove down the road. and, he may have caused birds to disperse, um i don't know he may have pushed things in front of him. so there was a_ you put that with the chain saw and you had a couple of things that might have made you um concerned. okay, um i'm gonna hand out, this is you know how i always hand out these kinda little lecture guides. i held off handing it out because i had the biases written down (here) at the bottom. do you think you'll have any ex- extra copies of that? i think so i think i did eighteen... i'll just give you mine. oh. are you sure?    i've got, a copy of each, if you want,    so are transect counts a type of point count? or not  okay. yeah um  um the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, was is the title of this. um, the whole research project and it's not just birds it got started, as a bird research project, um but there are people also studying plants, um invertebrates reptiles, you name it it's it's a huge project. um, just doing the birding, part of it um i lived with a dozen people, working on that at one location there was also another location forty-five minutes away um with another, i think fifteen people there there were twenty-seven of us, altogether, doing this project so it was, it's a large effort... but you made the assumption that if you had  there was probably a nest there um, that was, that was one of the hard parts was, you could go back, and if you knew we were going out to a certain plot the next day, you could go back and look at, the spot maps that people had done. you know, couple days before a week before two weeks before, and get an idea for what you were gonna see they were pretty similar throughout all the areas um, but you could also see where coverage was lacking. maybe certain times um, people would enter the plot from the same area, and take almost the same route well you know the next time you knew that you had to go in from a different direction and maybe cover a certain corner that people were missing. so that, you know you were getting a very thorough coverage and not missing any birds. um which was important for that. now how w- um, how were the questions that you were asking in this project different than what, what we did this morning? we were basically looking_ this morning, just you know taking a a basic survey, of what was there. um this study, um, was a a brainchild basically out of um doctor Fabourg at the University of Missouri in Columbia. and a an employee of the Missouri Department of Conservation, who wanted to look at habitat fragmentation, and a largely unfragmented habitat, a lot of studies have been done on you know in farm country and other heavily forested areas but nothing really has been done, you know in an, an uncut area and then come in and and um have, different logging um operations done there were plots that had, large clear-cuts, um you know and there was slash left all over the place. um, there were other plots and the clear-cuts were done to initiate an even-age stand so that you know every tree was cut down and then, once that grew up, the trees were no older than, you know, how long ago the trees had been cut so, in an uneven-age stand they had gone through and taken out, circular cuts, every so often and um, i'm not sure exactly how they determine size of these cuts they were, determined by the foresters um but they used, the techniques that they use for f- for f- foresting now. um some of it had to do with, you know was it a north-facing slope or a south-facing slope, um, you know the distance between some of the, uh the cuts in this uneven-age stand were a little bit different, um, but it's very similar to you know how they're cutting in other parts of the state right now so that's what, that's what they did you know i mean it wasn't, it's not like um you know a birder said okay let's cut here let's cut there, um that part of the project was given to f- foresters to determine and, you know we had to deal with that um and then there were other parts uh control plots, where no cutting was done at all. um and they were arranged differently in some spots, a clear-cut area was next to, um an uncut area or it was next to, um, an uneven-aged stand. and, you know that's something else to consider is, what habitat is next to, you know, the habitat you're you're working in?  what do you mean?     yeah did you put a grid, down on top of it?  okay. okay. and then you_ were you saying that the subplots within the plot, mhm.  th- the plots... th- they weren't square. oh (okay) thanks. (yeah.) yeah probably closer to twenty. yeah. um and getting, u- um, much greater in-depth information so the spot mapping is another technique but it's used for different, um for different purposes. okay um if we come down to the total count, um... that is possible to do under a number of different circumstances and that's what we do with the plovers the numbers are so small about twenty-five pairs of Piping Plovers in the Great Lakes region, that we try to get a total count. and we do that by visiting historic sites, we know what the, um, habitat requirements are, and we have done this every year. does that mean that we get a total count? well we know, from a_ for, a number of reasons that that's not that's not the case there're places we can't get to frequently they nest on some of the outer islands and in the Great Lakes, there are probably some sites that we don't know about. but we do a pretty good job. we feel confident we do. so that's a total count example another total count example, is you've seen enough of colonial waterbirds to know they're they're concentrated in one area that's what we (tried) to do with the Black Terns. our methodology was, uh in a sense like a transect you know we we moved through and counted everything that we found. um, we weren't depending on vocalizations we didn't do any kind of spot mapping or spot, or point counts we just walked through an area tried to get a tota- total count you can do this for you know other species of colonial nesting birds that are all clumped together. um, so often for endangered species or those that are, or where the numbers are very small or or you've got Colonial birds that are all together for instance a, a Cliff Swallow colony you could easily get a total count. you can also use that method. for most species however, you_ if you're going to do something with with their numbers during the breeding season or otherwise, you'll have to, uh depend on some other randomized type of of sampling that's representative. so a total count is usually just for a single species not like a  	1
LES330JG052.json	no, no on the serious side they uh, it says the primary reason for collecting an- un- and un- and analyzing this data is to improve the teaching and learning, of English for non-native speakers who will be studying or teaching at a at a university in the U-S, by analyzing linguistic features of a large number of speakers so, i was uh asked to participate and i said sure i'd be glad to do so, and uh, i think, since you are also part of the tape, you need to sign this consent form, which as the fine print at the bottom says i agree to any grade the professor will assign to me in this course regardless of my performance it's the maximum along each axis. exactly you would compute the travel time horizontally, and you would compute the travel time vertically, pick the maximum of the two and that's the travel time from the I-O point, to that point in the rack. so Chebyshev travel once to pick up once to deposit once to pick up once to deposit right? so there are gonna be two handling operations so, this one is two, P, P-D. oops i'm sorry with that definition i can't say that, uh this is the one i wanna use. let's go back and change this sorry P... or D, often, P equals D. yep that's what i wanted to do here. that's not a plus there. this is the time to pick up or deposit the load so we have two two handling operations. okay so if we ask ourselves what is the expected single-command cycle time uh exam and homeworks please be careful, whether i'm asking cycle time or travel time you have to, distinguish between the two. if i know the expected single-command cycle time, since we assume this is given and known and given and fixed, it's easier to find the cycle time once we get the expected single-command, travel time so the question is this now how do we find that? uh given all these assumptions i hope you agree that, the cycle time is gonna depend on the, rack height, and the rack length which we assumed were given in feet, and it also depends on the horizontal velocity of the machine and the vertical velocity of the machine so we have four parameters that, it depends on, right? nothing else... we assumed acceleration deceleration uh we assumed (it away.) uh we assumed the load-handling times are a given, of course that only affects the cycle time we're interested in the travel time, so what's left? the four parameters rack height rack length, and the travel speed of the S-R machine in two directions. okay? well, let's first break this down... expected value of single command is really out to an opening, and back and whether you're doing storage or retrieval doesn't matter cuz you go empty out loaded back or you go loaded out and come back empty it's the same thing. so, we're not concerned with whether it's a single-command storage or a single-command retrieval cycle, all we know it's a single-command cycle. and also, if i can get the expected travel time out, i can simply multiply that by two, and give the_ get the total, uh s- expected travel time, so... really all we need is that. expected out we're gonna simply double that. now, the first issue is we have four parameters to deal with before we get into the derivation, i'm gonna show you an interesting concept that... helps, the analytical derivation considerably and that's called normalizing the rack. that is we're gonna transform this rack, into a slightly different type of rack manipulate that get the results and then transform back, to the original rack, and basically what we're really doing is transform the rack into uh time, and reduce the parameters. the way we normalize a rack, is first... find the travel time, to the farthest point in the rack vertically okay? so let's say that travel time, vertically is T-sub-V then by definition, uh that's gonna be the height of the rack divided by vertical velocity. that's the time it will take the S-R machine to reach that point and remember we're modeling it as a continuous rack. the time it'll take to reach that point horizontally, is gonna be rack length divided by... uh horizontal velocity V-sub-H, okay? and then, we're gonna define, the scaling factor, cap T, as the maximum of those two, maximum of those two travel times   travel time is equal on both axes. exactly, travel time, is equal on both sides of the rack so that rack is square but it's not square in in in distance it's square in time right? so that rack is... square, in time which i'll, abbreviate to a SIT rack S I T. square in time racks have interesting analytical properties we're gonna see that. the uh they play a role (xx) they have some uh interesting properties we'll whe- when it's the right time we'll we'll we'll we'll address that. um, if you notice, B by picking the minimum of the two has something to do with the shape of the rack in that when B gets close to one the rack becomes square in time, as B approaches zero, it becomes uh flatter and flatter in time, so a quick example in fact i don't even have the numbers, for this, but might help to show you a quick example... if i have an I-O point there, and uh let's say, i don't know it takes, uh point-four minutes to reach there, point-eight minutes to reach that, then the scaling factor for this rack would be point-eight, minutes, okay? and the shape factor for this rack is gonna be, point-fifty... okay? so basically you ask what's the longer side in time? point-eight. and good enough T should be point-eight, now divide both sides with point-eight, and looking at that, as a figure is also helpful... because that really is your normalized rack so if you want to see the normalized rack, it looks like this... of course i'm not drawing these to scale divide both sides by point-eight then it's one time unit long in that direction, and point-five time units long in that direction, this is the normalized rack... okay? so, we've transformed the rack, it's almost like uh moving the rack to another planet. point-eight. point-eight. so it's just like you know define another time unit don't call it seconds don't call it minutes cuz those are all for our planet, but for them call them time units. to them one time unit is to us point-eight minutes. why this fancy conversion? why? because, note that... a normalized rack... is always, either... one by B, or... B by one you see what i mean? th- one side is always gonna be one time unit long, and the other side is always gonna be B time units long, furthermore, B is always between zero and one... so, what do we do with the normalized rack? suppose we find the, expected single-command travel time, expected single-command travel time... for a, normalized rack multiply by two. exactly to the center? to the cen- center of the rack or centrally or center of gravity... therefore we're gonna claim... that, so the the argument goes on average you're gonna go to the center of the rack, based on that argument we're gonna claim that the expected, uh normalized single-command travel time, is whatever that is okay? i don't wanna write it algebraically w- you compute the travel time, to the uh center of the rack and remember you do that by taking the maximum of that, and that travel time that gives you travel time to the center of the rack let's say travel time (xx) no volunteers? one. if you said B equals to one is this minimized...? if you said B equals to one this is one-point-three-three-three. one zero  well look if i said B equals to zero it- it's one which is less that one-point-three that's what we're trying to minimize. this is what we're trying to minimize. what happens to the T value as the rack gets flatter and flatter? i remind you the area's fixed... as the rack gets flatter and flatter as_ and the area's fixed what's happening to its length? it increases. it increases as the rack length_ so basically we can say it's getting_ we're we're squishing the rack down further the height's going down but as the height's going down the? length's going up. as the length is going up, wh- what's going up? T is going up, so, this is incorrect there's something going on, so i'll give you a clue and i want you to think about the optimum is that Z times G-Z, and B-squared over B? six. six. that's B-squared over six... you're gonna have to be careful between the Bs and the sixes here Z. still Z. i can keep going up like that and maintain a travel time of Z, up to where...? up to that corner. cuz if i go any farther the travel time would be more than Z. likewise i can go to this point, so i'm travelling a little bit horizontally but my critical travel is still vertical travel time to that point is still Z. Z Z Z Z and by the way what you're getting is a square contour line all the, points on that line travel time to any point on that line is Z... that's called a contour line, and, these lines will keep growing right? now you have Z you may call this Z-one then you have Z-two whatever different values, until, something happens look until you hit? B right? up until that point these contour lines look square agreed? what happens after you hit B? what if i said, show me the contour line to a Z value, but, Z is greater than B? what is it gonna look like? so we're in this region of the rack what would the contour line in that region look like? vertical. hm? vertical line. vertical line exactly.  what's the area of the rack? (E.) B. how could Z be greater than one? oh it can't be uh most people here would have wrote uh otherwise you still have to... uh well no you can't say otherwise uh cuz well negative Z values are not allowed, uh any other region uh it's one it i- in our rack physically Z can't be greater than one. but if if you leave it like this, nothing changes for us, statisticians won't like that. the C-D-F has to reach one and you hafta show when it reaches one. you see what i mean? no i don't understand the probability for the X, variable. uh the probability for the X variable is, take a uniform variable between zero and one, and you ask yourself what is the C-D-F of a uniform? that's the C-D-F of a uniform. okay. and i agree with you Z greater than one does not exist well at equal one it exists, but if you leave it like this statisticians don't like that. you have to show when the C-D-F reaches one. technically when Z equals one Z itself is one so it reaches there but they wanna see that. that's redundant. if it's confusing you you can ignore it. because technically as you see when Z equals one that value take- that function takes the value one... so that's just the C-D-F of a uniform (say) forty-five degree line... and this is this is also the C-D-F of a uniform but instead of uniform between zero and one this is uniform between zero and B... okay...? any other questions? 	1
LEL175SU106.json	let me remind you, one more time about the discussion sections tomorrow those of you who happen to be in the one o'clock, discussion session we're moving from fourteen hundred, to thirteen hundred Chemistry Building, uh if by any chance you go to fourteen hundred Chem tomorrow i think you'll end up in a P chem class, which i assume most of you would, prefer not to be at, some of you might wanna be there but, uh if you end up in a chemistry class remember we're in the lecture room on the opposite side, of the building. also remember for tomorrow's discussion that i gave you kind of a thought exercise, at the end of last Wednesday's discussion after we had critiqued, um that article that i read you from the Ann Arbor News found all the things that were wrong with that study, i asked you to think, in this intervening week about the kinds of experiments you might do. uh, and do a better job of trying to find out whether there's a relationship between birth control pill usage, and cancer risk, and i think i said there is no single experiment it's not like there's one right answer it's a very complicated question how scientists go about, establishing cause and effect, uh so i would hope to hear a variety of approaches which you might come up with, in terms of trying to experimentally address that question so we'll discuss those tomorrow, and see both the strengths and weaknesses of the various experimental approaches. today as you know from looking at the lecture schedule we're gonna to be talking about metastasis, which uh, the process refers to the spread of, tumor cells from their primary site of origin where they originated, to another organ via body fluids and most of the time we're talking about the blood stream the circulatory system. but you should keep in, mind that there are other body fluids there's the lymphatic system there's the cerebral spinal fluid, there's also the peritoneal fluid in the abdominal cavity. anywhere there's a fluid in the body that cancer cells can get into, those cancer cells could float through that fluid and end up somewhere else in the body. so basically it's uh, getting the cancer cell into a fluid somewhere and transporting it to a distant site. and usually we're talking about, the blood stream. uh by now you have a pretty good idea of the importance of metastasis, um, as a phenomenon first of all it's part of the inherent definition of cancer. remember the only defining characteristic of cancer, was the ability to spread by the process of engaging in metastasis. that's the only thing that distinguishes it unequivocally from a benign tumor. so metastasis is part of the defining, features, of a cancer. also last time you learned that uh, metastasis is one of the main ways that, cancer uses to kill people. uh the main cause of death is usually, not the primary tumor, but metastases spreading throughout the body and often getting into the one one of the vital organs, such as the, brain or liver or kidney, and this is often what cancer patients will die of. so this means that if we could do anything to interfere with the process of metastasis, in essence we could cure people of cancer, or we could at least cure people of the most debilitating and threatening life threatening, aspect of cancer which is the ability, of these cancer cells to metastasize. so today we're gonna focus on metastasis. and in essence we'll be focusing on the question of what is it about cancer cells, that in fact, allows them, to metastasize, while the benign tumor cells, can't do this nor do other, normal kinds of cells do this. in addressing this question, first of all you have to realize that metastasis is not a single event. and we talk about metastasis it's not really, a single, process that we're talking about it's actually, a sequential series of events, all of which must take place, in order for this phenomenon, of metastasis to occur. we commonly we therefore divide, metastasis into a series of stages and i'm gonna use three major steps, to divide this process, today. um, is tumor progression, necessarily uh, come with uh an enhanced grading, remember how you graded the tumor, it's microscopic that's a good question. it's not exactly the same thing. remember i told you that tumor grading, was based, solely on the way cancer cells look under the microscope what size of nuclei, metallic index lots of things that you see in the microscope. those traits don't have to change, in order for you to select, for a population that's resistant to a drug or can metastasize more readily, those things tend not to show up under the microscope. so often the tumor has progressed and it's it's quote unquote more aggressive, and yet to you look at it under the microscope and it looks pretty much the same. that's not always the case. sometimes it will look different. it would, it would be great if it always looked different because then you could recognize it. unfortunately it doesn't usually look different, we're looking at different properties here. 	1
SGR200JU125.json	okay, today's icebreaker is and yes i will give another one when it comes around to me again i have lots. my name is blank,    well then i'll come up with    okay mhm i liked that.  okay my name is Andy um, one crazy weird, uh fun fact about me is, uh i've lived in five states i think that's kind of, what are  okay which one do you like best? oh uh, oh Michigan of course. really though. i don't kn- ah, they're all a little different so it's hard to say. um, thank you   mm... probably Rome, most likely. (really?) (xx)   okay was this a bad thing  did you go last summer? or naw i was there a couple years ago. (oh a couple years ago? okay.) alright my name is Liam and one crazy weird defining fact about me is, um, gosh how'd you come by the name Bailey? um, that's actually um uh one of my friends uh last names, and just thought it was a pretty good name. (xx) schnauzer ownership? for yes, um, my name is Rashmi and, one crazy weird defining fact about me is, hm, i wouldn't say it's crazy or weird but like i have tw- i have a twin brother. that's cool does he go here also? that's cool mhm alright does it turn out to be a generally good or generally bad thing? i don't know it's the, i feel it's the same like i don't see, i don't know like i don't know how it is to have alrighty then. my name is Kelly one crazy weird defining fact about me is, that i got engaged when i has four and a half years old, (wait) how'd you know that he's at Cornell then? um i, he's from Marshall which is where i was born, yeah oh really i'm sick of politics. i know but you_ it seems like you have to watch it. i know, yeah it's like if you're not_ watching T-V and that's not on yeah i know. and it's i'm glad i didn't stay up last night.   yeah i think it's interesting they kept saying on the news like the president has been decided, yeah oh i know  one of the c- one of the channels yeah  oh (xx) yeah yeah save the paper. okay, so, organic chemistry. mhm i think a chart would definitely help. yeah busted marker. um,  hmm  oh. i kinda like to smell it, actually. yeah okay so  okay um  you haven't?  you mean chapter seven? yeah i've read chapter seven.   (xx) uh, pretty well. fine.  did anyone's not go better than the first one? (mine went better)   mhm so does everybody feel a little bit better about the class? mhm maybe not so much. i made some like dumb mistakes on the exam which is like, yeah i missed the stupid          yeah is this a long chapter? yeah     the problems did you do the problems here the,  some of them are pretty tough. i did like towards the end i kind of you know kinda gave up and there's a f-  oh man this is long, lotsa pictures. yeah i like pictures that take up a whole page. mm yeah yeah (xx) so, alright i w-     taco night?   i'll eat a piece of pizza. cuz my dinner   (thanks) not so much green peppers mushrooms and cheese. there's a piece with minimal topping. mostly cheese. alright i'll take that one. thanks. you're welcome. this one? (yeah that one) yeah i'm not an onion fan. i don't think it's i think, like it's green peppers. like it's looking and smelling like, green onions mushroom yeah i can't stand mushrooms. (so maybe they're pick-off-able) oh, i love all these things.  (xx)   okay. that's good we have an hour. so, hm hm where's Stephanie? what? where's Stephanie? oh i don't know. i think may- somebody wrote to me and said they couldn't be here. hm maybe it was Stephanie. i think so i think she said she'll see us next week. okay we could just like maybe S-one S- t- S-N-two and then talk about like, what's involved in what, um, (xx) like just for kicks do you wanna throw in like the E ones too? yeah yeah yeah   yup yeah which, i should probably (finish) what's S-N mean? substitution    chemists like to think they're  yeah  and E is how you read?    how about like how many steps they are. yeah... or key differences i guess. (xx) oh i'm gonna start with like number of steps, in each one. Liam okay i said Y is that's (G-shock) right? two steps yeah. and you just like, if it says one it's two, yeah, unless it's two steps right okay elimination is, can you have two steps too? yes   yeah but (you go for beta) but, what? (go on,) i was gonna say like i'm a little confused about beta cuz they don't really say much, they don't like use that explicitly in the book but i know like, i know (come up over and over.) what it is you mean? what  yeah is it just the so it's_ yeah i so the carbon with the lead- leaving group there's a carbon attached to that carbon, and the hydrogen is on, that carbon. okay. and what's the uh, i mean what's the point of calling it beta? just it just means that it's w-    yeah yeah  does it just fly away? yep no it's taken by the um, deprotonated yeah yeah, okay by the Bronson base right? so it's deprotonated? deprotonated yeah. and um, S-N-one carbocation one, E-one carbocation, yeah  are you guys starting to see what i, was talking about with the notes, for this, section? (xx) what did_ what'd you say about it? taking good notes.   cuz you'll want to reorganize it (like this  hm um, what else do we want to say? um have you guys talked about the chirality? no. oh yeah,  yeah that's important (for what,) that it has chirality? how does a reaction affect whether or not it has chirality? if it's a, (xx) molecule, let's say S-N-two, then um, (there's an R to the S) and vice versa? oh because there's always inversion you mean? right, yeah cuz like, when like you have a leaving group going this way, and then, mhm right is that for S-N-two? so long as they're the same    yeah but like, this is the trick (xx) in chemistry they start everything out sounding all nice and simple, mhm but our G-S-I said that if, you, like if there's always going to be an inversion no matter what however whether or not it switches from R to S she said usually does but, you got to check it just to be sure. mhm so there's always inversion. do we wanna write that up there? yeah let's   wait wait, for E-two though... how can there be an, inversion if it's going from a single bond to a double bond? hm hm there is like (unnecessary) (xx) (sections in the,) the uh, stereochemistry eliminations. is that like whether you (can net E or Z?) yeah i think, with  but when you have elimination you start out with something that's not, E or Z to start out with. yeah so it really can't have, inversion can it? it's not called inversion. is it? i'm telling you that there's more useful information in the four of you guys's heads than there is in mine. i have like two different elimination connectivities.     right, and one is gonna be higher priority than the other, depending on, um, the number of hydrogens is boun- i don't know how that, see these things seem like it'd be the same amount. what do you mean higher? um like there's an example in the book. like s- for example it, that one that's got more carbons attached it is higher priority than this one. right  but these two are totally different in the book. right that's what i'm, yeah yeah. so we can't really call it inversion then. 'm'm but can we say something about what kind of, thing it's gonna make? like is it gonna make all one? is it gonna make a two? is it gonna make, (xx) number that's a good question mm i which one? i mean these are just the useful things to have  yeah E-two right? two what? for E-two, is that's what we're talking about? right.   yeah mhm yes yes unless somehow like your nucleophile is, already on there somewhere. same yeah, right so chirality (would be maintained)   yeah, as long as that makes sense to you. like, yeah yeah  yeah, E-two. we were talking about what kind of molecules can make. yeah you have to have beta-hydrogens. okay. and  you have to have a, carbon-carbon bond. yeah one carbon-carbon bond are these requirements? yes yes yeah you, you need a car- a what? what'd you guys say? you ne- you need a carbon-carbon bond. and Rashmi feel free to just hand the pen off if you don't feel like writing on the board anymore. because isn't the definition, of elimination_ well, i get i take that back. i think just up to what we know every elimination reaction is going to be carbon-carbon, (xx) otherwise. yeah so far,  it's good to realize the assumptions that you're making. leaving group, and, then the hydrogen on the other carbon, okay, need leaving group. that what you're saying? yeah okay. hydrogen on the other carbon. that's a hydrogen on the other carbon like maybe we should draw it out write an example or something. yeah maybe we should  (zanton,) two-sixty-two (xx) (xx) hi hi  ohh we're being recorded, but if they ever use your first name they won't use your last name if you don't want them to use your first name they'll change it. the guy can tell you all about why if you'd like after study group, have some pizza. right on. we're making a chart. this one? it's Emily (xx) study group today oh i'm kind of flattered that people have more than one study group and they still come to mine. you can never have enough study groups. huh? you can never have enough study groups. no although i have  oh how's your Tuesday section going? oh, mm,   moan. yesterday was fine there was only two of them and they were both male. that  yeah um... that's pretty good. okay. so, is there anything else that's needed? like, thirty-two? um the one anti to the, oh why does it have to be anti to the leaving group Liam? um cuz that's what Dr Koreeda said today. and what Dr Koreeda says is law. uh, yes. he said that today? yeah while Hilary was asleep in lecture. right. it's    yeah,   how do you know which one is like the beta-carbon and which one's the alpha-carbon again? that's beta, because this is the  duh. okay yeah thank you no problem. okay can you say that like either to the board or, so that like, everyone can benefit from the wisdom that you and Hilary just gained? (xx) but i gained some    sure do i sound like i'll make a good teacher? would you like me to read your note out loud to everybody? oh gosh. flashbacks. you look like the type that would do that too. i never got anything read out loud to the class though. oh i did. twice i had teachers read it like to themselves but not like to the class. oh, no, what did you say? never anything good.  S-one? because, the C-H-threes are leaving it? no (the B-R.) ah, silly me. it's good that you guys are here to straighten me out. yeah    oh dear. what? (nothing) oh. yeah. okay then. so, we were talking about anti-elimination right? before i so rudely distracted you. what about anti-elimination? Liam? um, (xx) Rashmi? no um a Bronson base is attacking the, hydrogen. the beta-hydrogen. so does it take off the beta-hydrogen and then that causes the whole thing? um, it, takes off the beta-hydrogen at the same time that the leaving group is leaving, right? yeah so it's like a big old simultaneous, yeah right mkay. wait  the base attacks the hydrogen at the same time that the leaving group, is s-  okay yeah and if you need another marker just tell me and i'll go steal one. (i'm okay) okay so why did it, why do we have the reaction between the carbons that we do instead of between a carbon with the bromine and the C-H-three that's pointing out to us? you mean why is that hydrogen removed is that what you're asking? well, you're saying that the reaction's gonna happen between those two horizontal carbons right? right and not the two, that look vertical in our two dimensional picture? why? why not between the carbon with the bromine and the C-H-three. no idea (xx) um, that's a good question. because, it because it's easiest to, attack on the other carbon, because of the area that the molecules take up. that's good. mhm yeah um, what was it? chapter four when they were talking about, when a carbon is attacked when, like there's a certain amount of area, cuz it's tertiary, and it comes to attack like this oh so (that brings up) some kind of rule about substitution on carbons. it's gonna happen with the more highly substituted carbon. mhm. so, so (xx) right has to have an- anti-elimination. mhm mhm i got a feeling they're gonna find s- on the test? so can you say it has highly substituted carbon? or is that what you beta-carbon yeah base attacks a beta, hydrogen right?  how do you wanna say that? that it goes to the not here but here? yeah the double bonds lead you toward it. yeah how would you say that? in a nifty little paraphrase like three words.   okay but, wouldn't it be there isn't a highly substituted carbon, no   yeah yeah base attacks H on, most (xx) on most substituted beta-carbon right? yeah does that paraphrasing make sense to everybody?   so does knowing about this whole anti-elimination bit, tell us anything about whether or not we're gonna get E and Z? like can we look at that molecule that Rashmi so pleasantly drew for us and tell if it's gonna be E or Z? i think so.  you_ i think it'd_ you know it'd be, uh, E, because once the double bo- bond forms it's not gonna be able to rotate. and if it looks like the hydrogen, and uh, C-H-three are gonna be on the same side then the hydrogen, C-H-three, C-O-s- but it doesn't look like it'd be in the plane of the board  yeah  lucky you. huh? i said lucky you. oh that's not what i thought you said. no Kelly okay. i was like yikes, Z the Z-plane can you have different sides on the Z-plane? i think so. (alright) see, yeah tell me if this is a real molecule or if this is just all in my head. cuz keep in mind that all in my head is an option. oh that's not real (i think.) not real? no. that's, that's and is that at all the same thing too? yes what does this look like when you look down on it? or like at it from here we're looking down on it what what does this look like, from here? (you're looking in at the bottom) it looks like nope that's not right. well it kind of looks (xx) no (xx) it looks like a chair. well if you look at it  if i'm down here, above you, and it's above me and is it going, away from me or towards me? it's like, towards you towards you here right? yeah yeah yeah mhm yeah, definitely coming like straight at me?  yeah there you go ah yeah and where is this H (going) down here? going back back going back  yeah yeah yeah and does it have E or Z, designation? E E but it has something. yeah yeah um, what was your point? well,    oh. couldn't it freeze in any any,   yeah cuz they're rotating, consistently right? well how many options do you have? two.   (xx) what are your two options? just to make sure we're all on the same page.   well but why? well actually like, yeah that te- two okay can you show us? alright i'm confused. okay well  well i_ alright. let's just say this is a single bond and this is rotating. technically this can come down here so you have these two on the same tide side and this is gonna cohere so then but then do you have anti-elimination? like looking at the one where it is still rotating,  wait you're saying that this one is rotating,  this one wouldn't be, right is the other one rotating? y- uh, yeah. but it's going in and out gauche and anti m-  oh that's a good question. what i mean when we say anti-elimination what has to be anti? the hydrogen in the leaving group, or the beta-hydrogen. but there's two hydrogens.   no so pretty much we we're not gonna r- rotate that right-hand carbon right? mhm right right. so let's look at the, left-hand carbon. how many options do we have as it's drawn right now? uh one. right and so this is not rotating. we have one option right? right if it is rotating how many options do we have? two where's the other option? the other it could, those three could rotate on the C and you could have the, C-H-three and the H and the H kind of, switch places the three of them. so you would you still be working with that same H? no with the other H. yeah so if we do it right as it's drawn, and we do the whole reaction do we have E or Z when we're done? if we did elimination right now as it's drawn.   E   no i don't think so. so by looking at it drawn like that do we know what it's gonna look like after a yep yes mhm do we know for sure for positive no other options? uh yes mhm mhm right? as it's drawn. if they don't tell us we have to do it as it's drawn, what's our other option give us E or Z? E, uh Z   Z yeah Z. so we'd hafta, read the fine print to  mhm. i have a question. yeah i know the base attacks the beta-hydrogen and, then what happens to the B-R it just falls off? is that, it's just it's just the leaving group that just leaves? yeah. cuz it's simultaneous. so, where does the double bond_ oh so is the, the H, gonna s- the   right okay anyone understand that or not understand that? i understood it. did did you guys talk about um, antiperiplanar geometry? huh? no. we have not. have we done that in lecture? enlighten us. um, w- today when we were talking about the same kind of molecule, and they were trying to talk about what, H wh-    wait why are we protonating things? well i mean, w- which hydrogens are gonna leave, and so, oh so deprotonated yeah that's the same thing. would be the ones that are gonna be, leaving. so if you if you took that away and then this one away, you look at the molecule kind of like this on the side, then it's real easy to see, yeah mhm i think we started to talk about that earlier. mm we talked about why it has to be anti. okay okay. i'm going to pose a hypothesis, and then you guys can either accept it or shoot me down. okay you can? (is that what you said?) that's what that's my hypothesis. okay yeah, because, i don't know i i think it has something to do with, you want it to be in, or it's gonna be in its most stable form like if you d- looked at the (Numer) projection, so its most stable form is gonna be anti, and so i think you'd look at, whether it's E or Z in its anti, formation. is that so like is it more stable, if it's anti and the C-H-threes are on the same side? or is it more stable   right now right now right now so what's more likely E or Z? E E so do we accept my hypothesis? i accept yes does anybody like did i lose anybody? thumbs up thumbs down?  okay why does it have to be the anti-hydrogen again? the one that's anti to the leaving group.   anti (xx) j- oh is that it's n- hm? i didn't hear that at all. i  oh yeah. which is law. yeah i think it's just because um, they l- they want to stay at like, when they're um, the hydrogen's being attacked and the bromine is leaving at the same time, and they don't want that to happen on the same sides. so it's more st_ because there's kinda like partial bonds happening or like, okay that makes sense the hydrogen is partially attached while at the same time the bromine is only partially attached, okay    and the double bond is partially formed so, you want those to be, kinda far away. where'd you get that from? that's on uh i wanna know cuz i don't know   it's on   website yeah     whoa whoa you're more than welcome to.   yeah i don't ha-  yeah yeah wait (xx)         this is just a list of what you need to know for chapter eight nine, cuz chapter eight nine is the one where you actually have to memorize, reactions. mm okay unless you're taking the MCAT. well, then you're screwed. okay. so, is there anything else we could possibly hash out about E-two? are oh_ did you guys talk about rates? uh i think  i think it's just     they just want you to know, what the rate is dependent on.  reactants concentration_  no or just one? let's go_  my hip even though we all know better. okay   i was gonna say (i know) we are doing, rates yeah.  um, just the, one, the one with the leaving group right? why? cuz it's a two step reaction and the first step, is the rate-determining step, and that's when the leaving group leaves. i disagree because, oh this is S-N-one you're right okay i'm thinking of S-N-two wait, no now i'm confu- oh no i'm just stupid. carbocation   yeah yeah but like i've heard like professors say oh really? really yeah. i've never heard that oh when you had Frink. yeah in the past.      no.  how's Wagstaff? i didn't i don't know it just sounds like oh my friend has him. how does he like him? no? no?     really? who? that's  one of my friends had him and (he was) like, there was no problem. oh. okay you guys i'm sorry that i was late but wh- when it has the number of steps and i- and it's the S and N one, two, two steps two steps okay. that whole that row underneath it are number of steps. so S-N-one has two S-N-two has one E-one has two, ah okay okay so it's (xx) so um, the electrophile.   the electrophiles? yeah. the one with the leaving group. so the carbon leaving  the whole compound with the,  isn't there something also like, if there's like water, cuz y- you're gonna have this cation, and like the more things that stabilize it when it's a cation, (isn't,) oh yeah, the solvent yeah, that, does it_ that affects that just affects which one it ha- which one happens right? isn't that what the  so do we care about about the concentration of the solvent or only what kind we have? what kind we yeah, okay yeah so what determined what_ the concentration of what determines, um the rate for S-N-one? (xx) the one with the leaving group. yeah  yeah yeah cuz it happens after the rate determining stuff. it's all downhill, mhm  cuz that's, the, like getting to the carbocation is the slow step and this slow stu- step is the rate determining step,  mm so how  (xx) fine yeah  yep thumbs up? thumbs up? thumbs up? thumbs up? alrighty then moving on, S-N-two. rate.  yeah  yep oh the, uh leaving group, the carbon leaving group or the R, leaving group and, uh, the      so it's both. everything the, electronucleophile yeah whatever like   okay yeah Lewis base (xx) alright. is it in a Lewis base or (not?) it's, either. the electron pair yeah. yeah wait but are we talking about the base or are we talking about the nucleophile?   so is that a base or is that a nucleophile? it's a nucleophile it doesn't have to be a base or (xx) so,  no that's how he drew it.  yeah  yeah actually it doesn't.   um (A?) L uh yeah wanna put a N with the he put L-B, if that, i know we're not  well but is that, is that talking about the nucleophile or is that talking about the base that takes the H?     (okay) but there can be uh, yeah.    mhm  yeah it seems like the two go   yeah   yeah can we just call it  no oh Nolta did that, yeah NUC sounds good.        yeah there you go.     right the smiley face is (saying it to me.) great.   same as S-N-one?   yeah. i agree. is this bad that we're spending so much time on this or is this good? no it's   okay. and so what about E-two? E-two's the same as S-N-two right? yeah okay so, i- bel- it is. and is everybody cool with, why all this is? do you guys know if, Nolta's here tomorrow, in the morning at eleven A-M, in the S-L-C?. Thursdays? yeah.  yeah is she usually pretty uh, a lot of people come? like, she pretty busy, if you try to come see her?   i have class i can't yeah. no i sleep during that class. but even if he is here s- explain stuff to other people. well it's just that, we made a chart today and and, i mean you guys are making a chart and i got a different chart and it's just like all this information it'd be nice to have one, rock solid confirmation chart cuz, i've got stuff on mine that, that you guys haven't talked about and, mhm mhm i know you absolutely positively have to be responsible for the stuff on this sheet. sure okay. so what else  wow  this time. this  it is deceiving. they just wanna try to confuse you. they want to make sure that,    i guess so. okay so, do you want to like beat to death S-N-one S-N-two and E-one like we did E-two? just to make sure that, sure  we can keep going since you're not writing beat the crap out of 'em so do you wanna, go backwards or forwards or jump around? which one do you want to do next let's start with that? let's start with (that one) (xx) okay,  (do we) well, there's g- how 'bout how's it work? there's gonna be a leaving group, and the leaving group jets. and then there's gonna be uh, cation, left, stable cation,  okay so um, um hm?  yeah. i have a lot of them. this has not been a good week for this whole half of my body. i have one on my hand that i just got last night so it hasn't really formed yet i hit Jeff's loft. i_ oh with your hand? yeah. oh what's up (Olson) what's up Emerson Jeff squared is living together next year. they are? yeah i thought that was still up in the air as of yesterday at least. (xx) they were all out looking today i saw them when i was (xx) yeah. yeah i was running a little bit late cuz we were trying to do the housing thing. yeah it's a pain in the butt. pain pain,  you guys don't mind i'm just making kinda like a generic, (xx) that's how i like to show just drawing something.   okay so then the whole kinda reaction s- takes a little miniature breather right?  yeah  is this where, the molecule's planar...? in the transition state yes, yes and is this a transition state or is this an intermediate? intermediate intermediate intermediate i'm sorry is it planar? oh, no it's in the transition state that that happens isn't it? like when it has   i i guess it's not. cuz aren't you gonna have like, you're just all of a sudden like gonna have this open orbital but nothing, in here's gonna change is it?  okay so if  mhm   and an H group above my head. am i planar,   yeah yes am i in one plane more or less, yeah yeah rotation demonstration. yeah yes does that make sense? but i still have an empty orbital like sticking out of my stomach and coming out of my back. mhm right  well either way i mean, yeah   right yeah that's true. you're just spinning from being like this, yeah yeah mkay on either side. mhm oh so does that affect the kind of chirality type stuff you have there  so what happens if you've got half your molecules doing inversion and half your molecules doing retention?     no that's for   but um, this is this is one of those statistics things that if you do it enough it will end up with the right proportion. basically there's no good reason for it to either, come at my stomach or my back. like there's nothing making it want to do one or the other. so you assume that if you have enough molecules and you repeat this enough times half the time it'll hit me in the stomach and half the time it'll hit me in the back. does that make sense? yeah we can do the order of reactivity. tertiary, secondary oh yeah that's good. what? about, which was better tertiary or secondary? mhm  oh wait what did you say about um, here's is this the one where there's an inversion always? um, half of 'em will end up in inversion half of it'll be retention. (xx) racemic that's why it's racemic.   yeah and the leaving group was originally on the right so that's why, right so as the leaving group left from my stomach it can either come back in where the leaving group was, or it can go, the other way. oh half and half like R and S? yeah okay. and so when you have a mixture that's half R and half S you have a oh but wait that not even a stereo center. yeah that's true. um in the event that it were though, yes. more or less. good observation. there are you happy now? oh, now now children let's not get mean. you don't have to be snippy about it. you're the one swearing at people. (xx) i did not. sure sure that's what they all say claim innocent now i know better about you. yeah i'm sure you have. not really, i don't talk to most of those  that's a good thing. anyway, back to the topic at hand. so, so then, our nucleophile hits one side or the other, and all is (xx) are we all clear on, i mean c- is there anything else we can say about S-N-two is there anything more we can, beat to death about it? S-N-one? or S-N-two?   why would that  that because yeah that'd make a l- elimination happen more often right? because, the nucleophile doesn't, i mean doesn't really care to attack it because, it's not as positive because it has the negative, um, solvent around it right? oh so we're so we're saying that by having polar solvents around a positive, carbon carbon right  yeah  yeah right right (xx) uhuh yeah does that make sense? yeah um, yeah   i think like uh yeah especially if it's secondary, be a secondary can be, it's like either or, elimination or substitution right? yeah  okay so i guess we're gonna, get to that. well and um i have to go you guys so um, i'll see you  see you bye good luck bye see you next week have a good week. thank you. (xx) hm okay. so um, i think we beat this one to death.   the S-N-one yeah so i'm more likely, to form a carbocation if i know it's gonna be stabilized. if i'm in a nonpolar, um, solution, and i know i can either do S-N-one or S-N-two but my charge is gonna be all mine to carry it won't be stabilized at all, am i gonna head more to S-N-one or S-N-two? S-N-two cuz you have a stable, something stable come out of it. does that make sense? mhm that's how that whole solvent thing affects it. okay hm yeah looks like he's gonna explain it more in depth, just like looking at the notes that he gave or whatever it seems like that's the last thing that he has,  so yeah and my study group also made a chart, and it helped me a lot, and then we can kinda work through, the important details on that in making our own chart also... there's one i've got lotsa ch- i've got charts up the yin yang.  okay okay so, right here on the attendance sheet do, nucleophiles, and solvents   yeah the nucleophile is gonna,   i think that's  yeah cuz it's so unhappy. (i don't know) s- s- so that would be emphasizing what we have at the bottom. it doesn't matter what the nucleophile is,   yeah w- (i got that)   so like... final step doesn't depend on the nucleophile, (or something like that?) yeah well but,  yeah what?   so can we draw the final step? even if it just says NUC or it's a smiley face that's saying NUC or, alright so then, that or what's the other option? (xx) it from the other side oh yeah. could come from over here. yeah i'm seeing puzzled looks.   no i got that.    oh oh  oh yeah yeah, yeah  this is, supposed to be right here. okay yeah. i get it. so is there anything else we can say about S-N-one? i think it's pretty good. think we've beat it into the ground? okay, so how 'bout S-N-two? you guys, you guys (have this one? mind) if i erase it? (xx) so how does S-N-two work? (xx) it's just, it starts out just like, E-two, right?  yeah it doesn't attack the hydrogen. it attacks the carbon (xx) so then you're gonna have yeah, it attacks from the opposite side, of the leaving group. make sense? (xx) and this is like it's gonna, happen at a like, pretty much simultaneously s- s- what these little dots are for. cuz one doesn't happen first and then the next one happens. why does the arrow come through the carbon-two (xx) oh  (xx) mistake is this that X side attack one? yeah   okay   what? there's always inversion then. oh correct i was trying very hard to watch what i said so that why do you have a story? i always have stories.   i have a story for everything, but i don't think it's it's appropriate to share it at this i don't think it would be a learning opportunity for me to share my stories at this particular junction. what? you'll have to tune in next week. yeah.  S-N let's see, there's gotta be something else. so wait it's gonna stay R or stay S most of the time, is  (xx) most of the time. oh so chirality's maintained but like R or S isn't     yeah yeah but in this case you might not even still have chirality. i mean what if your nucleophile is C-H-three-C-H-two? right oh okay. so it's not always   yeah     this one i think there's some debate on actually be- before the last test, if this is a racemic mixture, then you have to assume, that, um, let me think about this for a second. that's a chir- that will be a chiral molecule, because, but there's just an orbital there, does it matter, when you have the, wh- when you have the cation? orbitals don't affect chirality. is that what you're asking? yeah don't they meet at the end anyway? like once the nucleophile comes in. oh okay, there's   cuz if it's three it can't have chirality anyway. yeah, that's what i was wondering. okay. oh yeah but it's not like, (empty R bills) have an automatic fourth or something like that. mhm  okay. so, again is there anything else we can say about S-N-two? can we really quick why did they call 'em S-N-one and S-N-two and E-one and E-two? what's the one and the two mean? bimolecular and unimolecular ohh, is that, are we get- like does that make sense? no no? so,   hm one how many molecules does it take to start an S-N-two? two deuce   it's just the same as the rate determining how many right. things  cuz like the rate, like how we said the rate is only determined by the carbon in the leading group, mhm  right just because are bromines all that unhappy with negatives charges? or  nope. so they'd be happier (with) more stable (right,) and there are nucleophiles around, but sometime- like if a nucleophile's not strong enough, to push out of a leaving group, mhm sure you've got a carbon it's got a couple of options, it's got, Mr leaving group whom we're with now, it's got Mr nucleophile who's looking pretty good out there on the edge.   oh that's a good  thanks Kelly you're welcome.  alright, um Kelly can just draw this one right? cause i got_ have a problem with that.  so how's this whole thing start? it's got a one molecule start and finish. don't laugh at me, is that really necessary? sorry i'm still laughing about that.   (the first happens) that's why they call it substitution? the leaving    oh for th- this one or for the other one    where have i heard that line? why'd hey okay so anyway, Liam enlighten us. how does this start? leaving group leaves, (xx) outta there gets outta there. okay  carbocation. can we draw it like underneath maybe? sure, uh can i_ mind if i just erase this  okay so now we take a breather, yeah yeah yeah no okay Anna in my other group runs marathons, and this is how we explained two step reactions. if i were to attempt to run a marathon, yeah the nucleophile comes in, and grabs that beta-hydrogen. what else does this nucleophile have to be? uh a good base right? mhm   a stronger (xx) (xx) okay so...  yeah, so is that the same thing as the other one except that it happens in a different order?    okay yeah (xx)   yeah it only has one transit- it doesn't have any intermediates (with) one step. intermediates are valleys. right, but i was saying that from, the first energy diagram that he drew up there,  this is happening like simultaneously isn't it? yeah     got it okay, so, why is it forming between the two double bonds that it is and not, one of those carbons and the C-H-three next to it? so it's, charged well but so does that other carbon that the nucleophile strong base attacked. yeah but isn't it_ it has to be next to the one that,    wait what? these are next to each other. those two are    it's more substitutive?    secondary you mean? secondary. so is it more substituted less substituted? we want the    oh okay.  which one?      so does that make sense? so what's the uh, secondary and, primary thing all about? (is like) what were you saying? um, well that's gonna actually determine, which reaction's faster. the primary secondary and tertiary carbons, and that was one of the things that we had  so if there was like,  right wait would be a faster is that what you said? yes why is that? because, it's more  yeah, it would be more likely to (xx) why likelihood? it's more likely to go to the more substitute carbon than, yeah is there any is there any like physical, (or it's) just just the way it is and take it for what it is? i think it's stability. okay  mhm yeah  gotcha so is that, thumbs up? yeah do the you said that which carbon was more substituted cuz it's substitutes the same thing that's not a c- a c- right. okay so he's got one two and he's got, see this one is just C-H it's got three Hs right. yeah so  yeah there's it goes to the one that's more substituting. right. yeah more substituted carbon    a- after chapter, eight? chapter seven. chapter seven?  yep okay that's good. so thumbs up?   yeah, for the,  alpha or beta?   beta right yeah right that's easy  so then the beta-carbon's gonna be the one that's the most substituted. right it's gonna work with_  right okay and so what kind of, which one of these do you want a primary for? the subs- or wait, the one, the S-N, (one or) an S-N-two okay  because it's less crowded and then the nucleophile is able to get in there easy. yeah    so this would be like if i'm standing here as like, a molecule, me wearing regular clothes as opposed to like Hammer pants and like a giant  got it no     oh yeah i think it was.   wait, i okay wait i have something else that he kind of talked about in class, like what about the P-K-A stuff? like which ones do you have to have? like conjugate conjugate acids less than ten or greater than ten, oh (xx)  (xx) you can probably even take the marker away from poor (xx) and let him sit down. woo hoo less than a month from now oh that was you huh? can we erase something? yeah the bottom's okay? erase anything.  that makes sense because you don't want it to leave once (it's off the end) right? you don't want it to attack one of the hydrogens. right ahh  conjugate acid less than or equal to ten? correct. it also  so that means that the acid's gonna be stronger than the base is gonna be? yeah (strong acid weak base) fabulous i always tell myself that strong acid weak base. weak base (xx) do you guys remember when he wrote up bulky bases? yeah yeah yeah so, we talked about it in our uh, in our group today, and bulky bases (xx) so wait what does that say? secondary carbon bulk favors the bulk favors, this reaction,  mhm so basically, if, it's yeah yeah crab soccer right right harder right. even harder. so it's gonna want big bumpy bases, are gonna want either, lowest like primary carbons, mhm carbocations right. or both. yeah both. i don't know. oh okay.  well because primary, yeah what? the clo- my clothes analogy. no   okay so if i'm in like pretty normal mainstream, not taking up a lotta space clothes, so i'm a primary carbon. mm one. or no i'm feeling very very skinny today. i'm   thanks Kelly. you're welcome. i want to be more S-N-two right? yeah the nucleophile can fit right there, yep oh yeah okay S-N-one right. does this make sense? yep mhm those are easy mhm mhm mkay mhm  right wait can you repeat, that first part again? yeah just if i'm if i'm a primary carbon, i'm real skinny, i'm you, it really doesn't matter like, we can decide whether or not i'm gonna more likely be S-N-one or S-N-two. it's pretty clear cut right? um, which, the carbon itself? like right it it w- it's reasonably easy to predict if it's gonna be more towards the twos or more towards the ones. how is that easier to predict?  right   S-N-two S so wait. (for something) right yes i'll i'll most likely  okay yeah mhm get rid of your arm right cuz something's gonna have a really hard time hitting me in the stomach i'll never get anywhere.    mhm right mhm kinda content both ways right, kinda wishy-washy. so in order to figure out which one's more more likely we have to look at the nucleophile what's trying to hit me. if what's trying to hit me is, right S-N-two S-N-two yeah    you're just lazy you don't wanna get rid of your  but i do have T-But-O. and this is my very favorite nucleophile ever and we can discuss why sometime if you really want to it's a whole environmental thing. this thing's S-N-one. oh yeah you're right does that make sense?   uhuh cuz i'm gonna need to do this mhm right mhm mhm that's bulky bases versus, small, or nucleophiles versus small nucleophiles. so that's why they ask you about secondary carbons, cuz we can figure out primary and tertiary, yeah okay so does what, (Scotty) wrote up there for us make more sense now? mhm yes very good Scotty. so now, i think we need to, fill some forms out real fast, so that, this can be (xx) go ahead it's all yours. can you imagine not ever taking chemistry and like listening to our conversation, yeah it must and it 	1
SGR385SU057.json	alright is the Moebius transformation stuff in here or is it in the, Stahl, or is it not in anything? um, i don't know i shoulda brought my notebook. i don't see Moebius in here... is that the handout? yeah this was that co- this was conjugacy so, it might not have anything to do with Moebius. okay i think it must be in Stahl like on around page one-fifty-nine, cuz that's what our exercises are out of. does she spell Moebius wrong? she spells it M O B  yeah    it's like Moebius. i can't say it like she can. she's like Moebius. you know i have like this other teacher in, four-fifty, and she was_ spelled it like, M O E B I U S. that's how they spell it in the book. i know. but, in our other class like four-thirty-three, spelled it like, Natasha. so i don't know what's right.   alright so what's R-hat? and  is that like yeah. okay   i'm trying to remember if it's R minus infinity or R, minus   right so that must be what it is. okay? alright so, okay so, we wanna find a... Moebius transformation... so don't we do it like she was doing 'em in class? was this on Friday or, when? um i don't know she just seemed to do something like this, one we want to go to Y, and infinity we want to go to Z. so then we have to write 'em, F-of-Z equals equals F-of-X, right isn't that what we do? F-of-X equals and now we want it to be, zero, A plus zero all over, zero,  yeah yeah so, F-of-X equals, actually we only need A to be zero right?  so you want F of-zero to equal X. is that what we're saying? equal X. um, oops yeah. right. so, it doesn't matter what A is right? and it doesn't matter what C is. it just mat- and D can't equal zero. right? well we have to have, one of 'em be X. oh right.    B to equal zero, C to equal zero, and D oh but here's, here's what the p- but we're supposed to, we're mapping zero to X so isn't, you stick zero in for Z right? uhuh right.  no. okay, say a function of a number, like F-of-zero, equals, like F-of-X equals zero, and then F-of-zero equals what? zero because you're sticking, that number, in the parentheses, you see what i'm well she did like F-of-Z equals A-Z plus B, right? so you whatever you stick in for Z on the left you gotta stick in for Z on the right so if we put zero oh so you want A to be zero. no. well, did we, okay did we determine that Moebius maps were like isometries or whatever? yes. so can we, can we do- can we do a reverse mapping can we map X to zero Y to one and Z to infinity? and then, will that give it to us? if we have a map that does that, then we we could if it would make you happy. well because it's a, isn't it hard to map, like how are we gonna map zero to X. you know what i'm saying? yeah i'm, kinda confused about what she wants. cuz if y-... this woman makes me crazy. cuz you're right. it's the case where like, where A equals one... B and C equal zero... and D equals one. but doesn't that map it to Z? no cuz we're not A-Z plus B so that's one times Z plus zero, all over, zero times Z plus one. right but our Z in this_ Z is just whatever, number you stick in.   wait a min- well. and what is X how do you get the X out? yeah see that's what i'm saying.  bless you. that's why i'm saying maybe we need to go from F-of-X to zero. alright let's try it. so let, F-of-X equal zero. so that's gonna be D has to be a number. well that's good we want some of 'em to be, we don't want it to be fixed by the one point we want it because we need to stick in stuff for the other points. we need to combine it so that one mapping maps, three different things, you know what i'm saying? okay... so alright if you wanted to make F-of-X equal zero oh so we're only doing one Moebius transformation for all of these? yeah. oh. yeah. there is a Moebius transformation which sends the points these to this. so then one of the matrix entries is gonna be X somewhere, presumably. that's C-X isn't it...? if you want, F-of-X to equal zero am i right? so won't C-X plus, D, or the kind of unknown? it means you need you need A to equal zero? A equals zero B to zero? B's zero then you have and  yeah but one of 'em has to be X.  okay so now you're doing F-of-X equals zero. yeah we moved on. not F-of-zero equals X. uh'uh... okay. so now we wanna do F-of-Y equals one. so we want, A-Y plus B, C-Y plus D equals one. so we want A and D to be one, or A e- to equal D, that's all we need. yea- no. no. we want A to b- A and C to be zero, B to equal D. okay. cuz we're mapping Y to one not Y to Y. and now move infinity to Z? so F-of-Z, equals infinity? oh wait this is a problem though. mhm. she defined what it was well because we said B equals zero from the first one and so if D equals zero then you're not gonna get one in that equation. for F-of-Y mm... we're making a matrices. see yeah how are we supposed to? like put in F-of-zero equals X. okay. how are you gonna do do this? so now we want don't A and C have to be zero? no. because, Z  okay A-C equal whatever oh okay yeah. right? sure. and now in the next one, we have, F-of-one equals Y. so now... that gives us, A plus B over, C plus D equals Y okay... so... okay i can see that. okay and now we have to do infinity do you guys have what she did, in class the first day, and made, the map for infinity? well you hafta, cuz she defined the map that was infinity. oh. do you know which day it was? it was the very first day she started talking about Moebius. um, she said it equals A over C. was that the first day? well i ha- does it matter what day it's on if i have it written down? no. i don't know, i have like, don't have all the notes from the other day. do you have it Herb? i think that was the first day though Friday March nineteenth. Friday March but that that makes sense nineteenth he said. nineteenth that makes sense because, oh wait. cuz really it's like, as, as Z tends towards infinity or whatever you  no i guess not. (it's so) so you're saying that B and D are, trivial. yeah yeah yeah she did she did. so, A over C. so we want, Z to equal, A over C   mhm you want, F F-of-infinity equals Z and so that means A over C equals Z. now we solve these equations, and put them all in terms of each other, use like the Y equation. yeah that makes sense A over C okay... alright. so A equals C-Z, and B equals D-X. so now, A plus, C-Z... D X well are we trying to come out with something that's, not got As and Bs in it, and Cs and Ds? we need to have something of the form, A-Z plus B, C-Z- over C-Z plus D, where Z's not necessarily Z, but where the Xs and the Ys and the Zs are, make up those different components. so we don't want any As Bs Cs or Ds we all want it in terms of X Y and Z? mhm um, well that's not necessarily possible, but... Herb you know we don't have any class next Friday right? yeah i saw it on the, um just making sure. i was quite happy. yeah she said she had to go somewhere... i get to sleep in on that day. yeah Mark said he doesn't have to go into any of his classes that day cuz i'll be skipping four-seventy-five as usual. my other classes, i haven't been there in a few days. yeah so Natasha's  yeah so he's all like, oh yeah now i don't have to go to any of my classes because, just because Natasha cancelled i can cancel 'em all. that's o- well that's the only class i go to, on Fridays. okay. so we have A equals C-Z and B equals D-X. see that's our problem, three equations four unknowns. cuz what we wanna do is get A equals B equals C equals and D equals, mhm in terms of what? cuz we know  what does A equal? C-Z okay. and B equals D-X. cuz you wanna be able to write something of the form, F-of-alpha equals, something times alpha plus something, over, something times alpha times something. mhm what is alpha? well i'm_ we already used Z so it's Z. but it's not, but because we got Z in the problem it's not Z any more it's a different Z. remember how she did F-of-Z equals A-Z plus B, well Z is just that, variable yeah mhm but we could also solve, for D couldn't we? mhm mhm mhm well if you put in A over C equals Z and then C equals A over Z the s- they're just gonna start you're gonna run in circles right? yeah so we have... but, do we also know that, well i guess that, that won't help... we- we don't know what A-D minus B-C equals. we just know it's gotta be what greater than zero? we would hope. yeah. don't you  A-D minus B-C otherwise it would be orientation-reversing. yeah but just we're also in the real numbers so you can't have a complex conjugate. right. oh i see. so what if we took A, B C did i find C? maybe i'm just doing this wrong i think i might have found C. Z minus X... why don't we wanna write it, C-Z, times alpha, plus D-X, equal- i mean all over, A over Z, times alpha, plus B over X? um... i just don't feel like you've told yourself anything like i guess no i haven't. okay i got a s- i don't know i got a C, i think oh but we decided that that that's not right right? well but we decided that A and C can equal whatever. oh that's important. well  that was in the first one but in the second one i have A plus B equal to,  that doesn't have to be true though. why would it not have to be true? i don't know what if- what if A plus B, equals two times Y and C plus D equals two? yeah. like one? let's... like what if you made, A equal Z and C equal one or something. but they can't equal whatever because in the bottom A over C has to equal Z. i know.  so you want A to be equal to Z, and C to be equal to one. okay, so what if we do that...? well no then that gives us uh, Z in the Y equation. unless B equals like Y minus Z or something well it could be done... it's gonna get complicated though... so if A equals Z, i think this sucks. and C equals one... then you've got, Z equals B over so you gonna watch the M-S-U game tonight? yep, i'm gonna watch the Ohio State game, the M-S-U game and the Michigan hockey games on TV also, it's a big night. who's M-S-U playing? uh, they play Duke. what're you gonna do tonight Herb? i don't know. mm, no party... i'm gonna go to the mall. that sounds like a good idea. i think i'm gonna sleep.  how about infervising, improvising? that would be scary. or else you'd have like that pizza sauce and you take off the pizza sauce lid and there's nice moldy stuff on the top did i tell you i did that? yes thanks. i just thought everybody should know.   that was, pretty good. yeah. but we're missing something out of every dish we could've made bacon and cheese sandwiches but we didn't have any cheese. and we could've made taco seasoning, taco sauce, tacos but we didn't have any taco seasoning. so it was like alright whatever we need to go to Meijer... alright, yeah let's look in the book can we, show that, can we show that there is a... would it work to show that there is a- like a hyperbolic isometry? or does that not work cuz we're in R-hat? i think it would still work. cuz if there is, a Moebius transformation that's automatically a hyperbolic isometry. how do you think Natasha learned to say Moebius like that? i don't know. you just like that too much. i can't say it i can't say it like sh- she can. i took phonetics and we learned how to say things like that but it's really easy to forget how to say it. i took phonetics so we started s- saying all sorts of non-English sounds and it was really hard. you'd be like /oe/, Moebius. i wonder if you'd be good at speaking other languages. well i know you like language and stuff but like, yeah that have non-English sounds? yeah like Chinese. oh my goodness. that would hurt. i'd be like oh no i still haven't figured out that one syllable. oh she was telling me about, John's real name when she came over. hm'  Mandarin Chinese. well and she was trying to tell me what his name was but she said she can't pronounce it.  hm' and oh, no i i've been trying the whole time i've been with him and stuff. i just haven't figured it out. and then his mom, told me, this other word, has the same syllable and, i- it's like a compliment oh you know, good food or something like that you know. and i would say it it's just, i can't say that syllable. i'm just like oh okay... hm he was born in Taiwan? yeah he came here when he was two, so. he picked out, his goofy name. when he was two? no when he was like a little older. oh he didn't need a real name. after all Mandarin names are all fake names.  yeah. so okay, lemme- lemme give a go at this...  okay there aren't any like this in the book. she never gives us anything that we can use. do we wanna work on part B?  i'm sick of part A well i'm still going at part A okay you truck along on part A and we, will continue and try to get some insight... which is? like, sometimes, we said, it's gotta be a fixed distance from here and a fixed distance from here and a fixed distance from here, and so it has to determine, every one in the plane. or maybe we could do it using the minimal motion that she talked about do you think we'd be able to do it using that? it's probably got a point at infinity because she talked about, you remember when we used to do things like this and we used to say we have zero here  all of R-hat or all of H-two? we're working in R-hat. oh i wanted to work in H-two. well since we were in R-hat in A i thought okay, we can still be in R-hat. if it fixes zero one and infinity it  where is R-hat? and how is it different from C-hat and how is different from H-two? well R-hat is the real numbers, plus infinity. C-hat is the complex numbers plus infinity so it includes the real numbers  um... we're just, looking at one point and it's just a point, it's like a, it's probably like, you'd have to like look at the real number line probably. oh on the real number line? right no. why not?    yeah if it's a if it's a line, i don't know. it's not the, Euclidean, it's not the, X-Y-plane is it? no  C-hat? yeah. cuz you get the real part of the number and you get the complex part of the number. so the point Z is a point on the X-Y-plane... you know what i'm saying? so, R-hat is the ones where, X, where but R-hat must be out_ the line, because the, it says it calls the points zero one and infinity, right? yeah you're right it doesn't yeah yeah i like that. yeah because the I part has to be zero so it just has to be just A. okay. so if it fixes zero one and infinity it fixes R-hat... any Moebius... transformation... so can't we say it has to be, like a f- what we need to say is if we pick a point X, on this line, then it's a certain distance from A, from zero, and a certain distance from one, and and a certain distance from infinity certain distance from the point at infinity. because  yeah but you can't necessarily measure a distance just cuz it's a point right? it's an infinite, distance... alright. yeah. and right right. so let's think. i mean if it's outside, of the interval between zero and one, then it doesn't matter which side of the line it goes to because you're a certain distance from zero and a certain distance from one. well you're mapping infinity to A over C anyways right...? so you're mapping it to a real number. you're mapping it to Z. how can you do that?   yeah so, are you doing the problem or the hint? well i'm onto the problem now. okay... d- i'm just thinking about part, even part A or any of this, how can you find a M- Moebius transformation that maps uh, infinity to a number, and still preserves distance. maybe it's not an isometry. oh yeah it is. the Moebius group is the isometry group of H-two. well we're not in H-two we're in R-hat. F-of-infinity equals infinity? yeah... alright so we have, i mean if X i- is not between zero and one, if we're fixing it now, for the hint, then it doesn't matter, where infinity is. so the only time it matters where infinity is is if it's between zero and one. no it still matters. why? in fact, the only place i think it matters is when it's on a half... cuz only then is it the exact same distance from zero and one... otherwise you could be, like one like three units from zero and two units from one, that tells you where X has to be and what side of the line it has to be on. mhm okay so let's say that uh so if X isn't at a half then it doesn't matter where it is. yeah i'm just mulling that all over in my head right now so then to find out where it is from infinity we just need to see if X minus infinity is greater than zero or less than zero... okay. how is it? it's pretty good. well what can you hear in there? so um is that somebody's heartbeat? it's her pen. that pen is so loud. i got X Y Z with th- my, little doohickey, this little doohickey, it'll give you X  bring the doohickey over here, so i can look at it. these are my two pages i kept 'em in front so oh goodness gracious... i mean you can always have, um multiples of something, you know how you have, two over two   huh? you used L'Hopital's rule? that's how because you like when you plug in infinity, you get infinity over infinity uhuh L'Hopital's rule   yeah like, i got it from these things and i just saw if it worked, and it did. they all simplified. if it works. alright so then do we wanna talk about, it? well. do we wanna write it down to look at it later? i need another piece of paper how did you get A B C D in f- in the first place? yeah yeah let's talk  oh so you took out the multiples. so because, s- when alpha is one, and C is just some number, you can't really determine, what D is, because, C and D have_ the sum of the two has to equal one and the sum of the tops need to equal Y. beca- because if A is two-Y and B is, three-Y you'll get something ridic- a just a multiple, so. so, what did you put in F-of-X for? oh F-of-alpha. so and the other equations i used was, A equals C C, and did you give me that, B equals D-X? yes. so i don't know where you got B equals D-X i just trusted your judgment. oh that was easy. where did you get it from? um hm hm hm hm hm... because, X equals B over D. yeah,  oh that's what where i got it from. see, i knew what i was doing really. oh yeah. i don't know  yeah, it was no problem. and then i got  that's great. oh no isn't that pretty? it's like,  no. well i'm still on i'm, i'm just putting down something so i can look at our numbers. so yeah so you're showing that alpha equals, zero, is supposed to give you X right? mhm. which she did. which i did a very good job of it. here you look at this. oh,  oh i see. i thought i'd make it legible since, you might be curious. did you, were you able to read the notes okay that i copied? i haven't really examined 'em.  oh that's fine. okay yeah. oh no that's fine. i can read it... how did you get... you said F-of-zero, equals Z minus X over Z minus X? no, times,  times. i wanted to get rid of the fractions so i multiplied by Z times X. oh i see okay.   did you? argh, you little brat. you lazy bum what's the matter with you? so, how did you get A equals Y minus X over Z minus X quantity Z again? oh. let's see. well, you know how you have A equals C-Z right? mhm mhm plug,  okay i'll start copying this and you write it down.  oh my goodness, you wrote like a hundred zillion things. you don't need to write all the steps. she was just doing a good job of calculation. and you multiplied by Z minus X over Z minus X again? yeah there's that one time i didn't need to do it i just did it for no reason.   like, B equals Y minus, A yeah right so and then you took B equals D-X, implies Y minus A, equals one minus C times X. okay. mhm and then you added? so you get C-Z plus X minus, C-X, equals the quantity equals Y, right... so, you get C times Z, minus X quantity, plus, X, equals Y, you subtract X from one side, and then divide by Z minus X. wow. and then once you have C you can figure out well, y- basically, you get A next, A is just, C times, Z which is Y minus X over  wow. i was pretty happy... you know where i learned to really get through this yucky stuff, is last semester, in four-thirty-three, had all those ca- calculations yeah yeah you know that sure didn't work on uh... what did i do tha- what did i say that i was gonna do that night?   oh yeah  it didn't work on her i got like a sixteen. it usually doesn't work for her.  okay. oh well you know i- i mainly got like, good grades so one sixteen will not kill me. so we determined that R-hat, for B, we're like working on a number line.  mhm  yeah it's a line. i mean we could be in hyperbolic space if we want can't we? not if we're on the real line because that's not a part of  i used to know somebody like that who would just get up and walk away when you're in the middle of like,  yeah, that's i've noticed that. yeah. this is only for a, short period of time. usually he like leaves for an extended period of time. i think he needs a break from us so he just gets up and walks off.   i had to get water. mm i just get water from the kitchen. and there's a cup right there too so you could actually bring the water  is that coffee? no uh it's not plugged in. what is it? oh well we could plug it in. what does it say...? oh. yeah there's coffee in there Mark. i was hoping it was gonna be hot chocolate. but Herb, it doesn't_ it's not plugged in so it's cold. yeah i know okay just checking. did it have all that stuff in it? yeah. it was like oh yay i get to carry a suitcase all the way across campus. how  no thanks no thanks i'm alright, i just drank a Coke. Mark? no thanks. alright. so what we decided was that, it's a line, the real line, and, i would be fine with saying that it has to be an isometry of the real line. and she can get over it mhm. i don't_ i still don't think that matters. i don't think the middle point even matters. but you have to know where it is. you have to show that it fixes R-hat. and you can't fix R-hat unless you can determine exactly where it it is.   yeah. oh so you're saying that it doesn't matter because, if these are fixed it's gonna have to come in between so that the distance works... well just if they were swapped like if this was one, yeah right eh but it's not you don't have to_ it doesn't matter what what happens with infinity if infinity gets mapped over here that still doesn't matter does it? well then it's not the same. what if it has like this and infinity is over here? but we're s- we're arguing that that map can't happen. yeah and that's because infinity is, on the right so, if X minus infinity, is less than zero... if X minus infinity is less than zero then infinity has to be on the right. no X minus infinity, is gonna be negative infinity. right? always, right. no because if you put infinity over here, then it's gonna be, bigger than zero... that's the idea. well, but infinity's over here to start with  yeah. F-of-X, minus F-of-infinity. okay i don't know what's going on anymore. yeah but something like that, and then if it's less than zero then infinity's over here, if it's bigger than zero then infinity's over here. Herb maybe you should do this problem for us. no that's quite alright. i'm like trying to figure out what the heck i don't understand it so now i  yeah, that's because she talks and then she goes like this, yeah the little hand-waving thing and she's like, tell me if i'm wa- i'm doing too much hand waving. none of us speak up it's kind of like well Mark does sometimes. she'll be like does anybody wanna see this he's like yeah can't you just show it to us? well i di- i always feel bad i wou- i would always be like just show it to us, but i th- i don't wanna be the only person who ever says that but, if she always shows it to us we spend more time in class going over our old stuff which is good, and we spend less time getting the new stuff which is good. yeah.  oh good, i haven't looked  that might have been kinda fun. no. oh. oh part five outta eight parts? but i don't think we're gonna get to the algebras. that's good. that's like yeah we don't have to do as much math. cuz we're spending forever on Moebius. that's just, not very good when you're math majors that you're cheering you don't have to do much math. yeah, i'm a linguistics major and i never cheer about not having to do very much linguistics. how about you Mark, aren't you an English major also? yes. and do you cheer, to do like homework in, linguist- uh no not linguistics English English do i cheer to do homework? yeah. i just he doesn't like strike me to cheer about,   what do you cheer about? basketball. yeah i cheer about sports. um, not this crap.    i think i hear some pleading.  i believe we could also. let's go to Stahl and then come back. alright... why did she give multiple parts for every single problem we have? she wanted to torture us. yeah.  i really like how she says this problem set contains a total of four problems. it's like no. four times two plus one, problems. why does she tell yeah why does she tell us it contains four problems? yeah oh i can't see em. oh the printer's chewed off just cut off number four and so that's why, maybe that's why she puts it at the  yeah she's like oh that's not bad this problem set only has four problems in it yeah whatever.   for all of 'em. two parts for all of 'em?   oh you've gotta be  well at least we only have to do, two of the five parts on, fourteen. what? no this won't necessarily be that hard. did you say two of the five parts on fourteen? yeah we only have to do one and two out of five oh alright. and on fifteen we only have to do two of, well one out of four but it's number two number fourteen one, and two, and number fifteen, number two, and number seventeen, one and two, and number twenty-one, finding a Moebius rigid motion hey let's do number twenty-one well why don't we- fourteen's gonna be easy let's start there. oh  if you say so Mark how many points is that i have a hard time believing it though. i haven't seen the problem yet. i'm confused. huh? yeah. of th- supposed to be points probably. okay. well that's just so they don't have to write out those coordinates probably. yeah so so that's what Z is. you're gonna start with an inversion centered at zero, radius three, and then you're gonna do an inversion at centered at A, radius two. ah that's what A is alright alright. so let's look in our notes and pull out the formula for inversion. of radius,   you see i brought the folder,  i'll take the notes. you seem really happy you just grabbed 'em. whoa yay me i got all the notes. i am note-woman... Friday March nineteenth so Christina, what do you cheer about, i mean you said besides linguistics. i cheer about linguistics mostly, cuz it's fun... oh that's R-two. i think, Herb do you have your notes for Wednesday the seventeenth, with you? oh actually i do. i don't have my notes here  not always. often... and look at the very end of that that notes. like the last part like or the last of the list? well she first starts talking about isometries of R-two. then she goes and then she gives a theorem. and then, i think she might talk about hyperbolic space in the last half of the class. you wanna look at these? sure.   yeah. one over Z-bar is one over Z-bar was it? yeah oh so we have one over Z-bar. okay how about how about page one thirty-seven? maybe not, maybe it's the second half of the, class. at the bottom of the page. example nine-point-ten. yeah. so it's, K-squared, over Z-bar... so now we write, I equals, zero, plus, one-I. well it's not just K-squared over Z-bar. yeah it is. the inv- no look at the_ alright look at, here's what you want right here. cuz it's that's what we're doing we're doing an inversion, of the point Z, with  we're doing this right here no we're doing this.  yeah. well we're doing I-zero-K. alright. so i'm doing this one and then later on we'll do  yeah yeah. yeah. so if A equals zero then you get, K-squared over Z-bar. where are you getting the K-squared though? K-squared is the radius of the inversion. oh okay  alright so we got K-squared da da ta da. i got, two. Z-bar. so you got nine over negative-I? uhuh okay. i got 'em all. we want I-zero you're right these were easy well j- we didn't do fifteen yet. no i'm doing fourteen part two now. i told you those would be easy. you're right you're right. you win a prize. s- so tired right now. i slept at two o'clock and woke up at, like eight o'clock. why did you like oh prayers i went to bed at like two and woke up at like, ten forty-five. so you got nine over one minus I and one over minus-three minus four. alright and now we are doing, if A equals three comma zero then the inversion... so we're gonna have... doing  okay   okay. two-squared over Z-bar, minus... three, plus, three oh you mean, don't leave it in fraction form basically? mhm. yes, that's a good idea. well it's still fraction form, but they  yeah you wanna just make sure you don't want any Is on the bottom. okay. i stole your paper. whoop. hm. so- did you say whoop? okay /s/ whoops. oh whoops. whoop /s/. yes Herb? i'm just like maybe i'm just a bit confused. oh we have to do it for that? silly me. never mind. alright. uh oh no no, no. hey i started to sing a song. we wanna get the I off the top? oh you're doing the ones in A too you're flipping 'em over. yeah i'm doing it all. oh. so you multiply 'em top and bottom by,   okay... and the next one you multiply by one, plus I over, one plus I. nine plus nine-I all over, one minus I-squared. nine plus nine-I, all over one... plus one. equals nine plus nine-I all over two... that what you got? yeah. and now you write it in A plus B I form? mm, well you can, you don't have to. as long as you get the Is on top that's all they care about. if you look on page one-thirty-nine, or, yeah one-thirty-nine... they always get the Is on top. yeah. so the first one's nine-I? yeah... alright so now we'll do number three. yeah... now you have twenty-seven plus thirty-six-I over twenty-five? yeah. okay... okay... so... I-eighty-two you take that. it goes into four that goes in like, so what j- did you get for the third one? negative-twenty-seven plus thirty-six-I, all over twenty-five... the third one right? thirty-six-I? yeah. over twenty-five? yep. okay... oh no. i messed up...   i'm okay. what'd you, get for one?  okay. what? messed up. again... negative-five, plus fifteen, get five-I. negative-five-I plus fifteen. hmm. i got four-I minus twelve. oh but i think you're right, negative-five times negative-three, is fifteen. so that would give me, four-I plus eighteen over ten? yeah. yeah. alright. that's good. alright now we're doing the last one, the second one. you with us here? yeah i'm catching up. i'm just trying to hold on. yeah over ten. over ten? mhm. cuz you're on number, A right? yeah... i got over five. i don't know when you multiply negative-I minus three, and you square it, then you get nine plus one, which is ten. three where did you get a three? because it's all over negative-I minus three that's the conjugate. or something. negative-I and then you have to subtract the three in the bottom. four over oh i have a two. oh yeah you don't want, don't want a two on the bottom  that's yeah.  yep. yes. and then like, the two is K. yeah. i see. i see the error of my ways. did you do that next one yet Christina? almost. i have, four-I, plus seven, all over five. i got negative-four-I. oh no i still have plus-four-I. i have negative-two-I, plus four, plus three, plus six-I... when you multiply a negative-two,  okay. i don't know. i think it is. oh no, fourteen times six? six times four is twenty-four, it's eighty-four. what did you get for the second one? four-I plus seven, all over five. yep. that's what i also got. are you done? uhuh. i reduced, at the beginning so that, i wouldn't have to do all those high multiplications you were doing. oh well i got, a hundred and thirty-two plus sixteen-I all over fifty-two. okay. now just divide it all by four. divide it all by four? four goes into thirteen three times, carry the one, thirty-three, plus four-I, all over, one, three, all over thirteen. yep. ta da. yep. (does this look better?) i'm so proud. thirty-three plus four over thirteen yep. okay. fifteen part two... mhm. oh so what we were, no. what is this? this isn't a complex number? Z could be. yeah but this whole thing so it's gonna be four over, two-Z minus one all over Z plus two quantity bar, minus two, no minus three, plus three. alright so, let me see this again. so you've got don't you think the answers to any of these might be in the back? no... the level of this mathematics i want chocolate...  what were you saying? i was mumbling something to myself,  i thought i was talking to you but i guess not.  i was talking up but my, i've got a sore throat, so. cuz my boss he like talks, to himself, all the time. and it's like i've learned to tune him out when he's doing that so i don't even hear what he says, so. but usually i don't talk to myself i'm talking to somebody when i'm talking. so can we find the bar of this whole thing? i don't know. okay so i think no... it's rotation over the X-axis no reflection, over so this is X-axis another K-squared over, K-squared, over the Z-bar, quantity barred are you talking to me? yeah. okay.  what did you say? is it K-squared over, the quantity K-squared no it's K-squared, over, the quantity, bar, minus A, let me see cuz i didn't_ this is what i was talking about no. it's over... what are you doing? what number are you doing? i'm doing fifteen, part one, isn't that the one we're s- no we're doing fifteen part two oh no wonder. that's a little confusing. there you go. i just put another dot, just put another I. so now you have two Is. uh i guess w- s- ts- i guess no wonder, there was a little miscommunication. so, we have to learn how to find, the conjugate   yeah she did. what rules? so this equals come back it probably is the bar, it's probably two-Z minus one bar, it is it is is that how it goes where are those rules they're not on page one-thirty-five? right here oh. those don't look very much like, bars, like rules. oh. maybe they aren't rules, why am i d- using that? no i think they are but they just should've set 'em off you know made 'em look nice. so you're right it's two-Z-bar, which is basically, it's two,  i think you can t- e- break 'em up like  so it is,  what's this? didn't, she give us a rule like that she gave us, through example. it is gonna end up to be that. two-Z-bar minus one, over, Z-bar plus two. so now our answer is, yeah, basically don't we have like  plus three. but we need to be able to multiply it all and make it look nice right? yeah so we gotta yeah alright the minus-three? the minus-three. yeah me too. so so, we have, minus-Z-bar, plus five, all over, Z-bar plus two? wait, i got i might've messed up. i got minus-Z-bar minus seven but oh yep minus seven. okay. all this ti- plus three? mhm. i agree. you could just flip the  yeah. well it's f- yeah four-Z-bar plus eight. all over minus-Z-bar, minus seven. plus three now let's get the plus-three in there. yeah. Z-bar, minus... twenty-one minus eight... thirteen, so minus thirteen? twenty-one minus eight is thirteen? yeah. okay. Z-bar minus thirteen all over negative-Z-bar minus seven minus seven. now, now what? now do you wanna multiply by negative-Z-bar plus seven?  yeah. i thought we were. so now we have to write it do we have to write it in Moebius? that is a Moebius transformation. you get mhm so y- like and C is, negative, one? that whole expression, I-A-two composed with that is this. yay alright, so that's fifteen part two. is this what you got...? i was kind of off in a daze. yeah. yes. so now, number seventeen right? okay. peachy.  yeah, you can look. hyperbolic reflections she said it means inversions, or reflections. over a,  yeah, two is this one. K-Z-bar? K-Z-bar. thank you...  yeah. alright so we want two-Z over five so F-of-Z, equals. two-Z over five. and... K-Z over... bu- but what's K in this one, what's K in this one? K isn't necessarily the radius here. yeah it will be. but for here but what about this. over this K is... it's like what sort it's like a i think it's the distance it is from the Y-axis. yes. okay. yeah but we're we want a f- reflection across a vertical line. that is the vertical line that's the Y-axis. so we'd also, have to compose it with a translation or something or what? do we want to really? well no she's saying a hyperbolic reflection can be a, inversion across a vertical line not just across the Y-axis it can be at any vertical line. yeah. but i don't think we're gonna need to translate in the first one. well no that's great if we don't. i'm just i'm just saying, what if, a reflection across the Y-axis doesn't work? what if you need a reflection across the line Y equals three?   alright. beautiful. okay. okay. so we want want   Z-bar Z-bar times Z? no Z-bar times Z-bar. oh. i don't know if Z-bar times Z-bar, but the Z-bar of Z-bar is Z. that's good though that's good. Z-bar-bar is Z. yeah. yeah. so but Z-bar times Z-bar   that's okay though   so we're just gonna start  we just start with, Z right? and now let's, do... so we wanna how do you get a denominator that's not Z? well, K t- we have K times Z, for reflection. one over five, K equals one over five. or K equals two over  but oh... right...? alright let's look at what they wrote about how 'bout that? yeah, you do that and i'll think... seems like the first would be, square root of two. then we have... do the inversion, zero square root of two. equals. two over, Z-bar. square root of five, would be five. yeah let's try this. what do you have? what? two over... just a second i gotta think. two-Z, all over five is that what we wanted? yeah. that's what i cheer about. that's wonderful.  alright let the first one, be an inversion over zero com- okay. we're gonna take, inversion, zero comma square root of two, composed with inversion, zero comma square root of five, of Z. okay. and you do that and see if you get what i got. hmm. i'm doing the five first... might work. that sounds good. mkay. i like it. i like it. cool. okay. alright now let's do number two. yep. now this one's gonna be harder... that's, very pretty. (xx) this one's gonna be a lot harder. okay. let me i'm gonna try it how they have it in the book here. ooh. one-forty-two one-forty-three. it's complicated but ooh. so so if, F-of-Z equals this, and F-inverse-of-Z equals this (xx) four over Z-bar, minus, minus-four, plus okay so there's a straight geodesic... how much time do we have, on the tape? one thirty-seven. there's an hour thirty-seven left on the tape? now that's how much, we've been here. oh so excited. she always looks so dazed when she looks after she looks at the clock. it's like  i don't think i can do it. she's under pressure now.   i think i'm starting to come down with something, so. huh? i'm starting to come down with something. oh and you too? i've had something for like a week and a half. don't get me sick guys. my throat hurt on this side for like a week and like now it's moving to this side. huh. my throat hurts on this side but it's a different kind of hurt, it's like pain. under here i'm afraid to go to U-H-S though. why? cuz of the stories. i've been there oh i've never been there with a sore throat. oh, see they always treat it wrong. hm. see i didn't have to do anything i just like, damaged a nerve,  yeah i don't know how i   it's fine. you just had to, wait till it regrew, oh two-Z so what is R in this case? R what R? whose R? in their,  but it's talking about reflections. oh goodness. moreover? yeah. moreover.  R is an arbitrary real number. okay. R is an arbitrary real number? yeah doesn't that- isn't that helpful to you? yeah.  i'm ready to crawl under the table and just take a nap. don't crawl under the table we would be embarrassed for you. hey look. hey  hmm. centered at the origin? that makes se- oh a reflection in a bowed geodesic is an inversion over a circle yeah   yeah they called it reflection in the bowed geodesic. well and a reflection in the straight geodesic is a r- reflection. yeah that's what i think. but the rest are inversions... plus R.   yeah. we need to do like two-Z, the vertical,    we have to multiply by something right? in the book they multiply it by something. they said one times negative-Z-bar plus R over zero times negative-Z-bar plus one. look at example nine-point-one-three. down, you see where it says yeah. i think that multiplies by something... see first we need to multiply... we need to do the kind that multiplies first, then do the kind that flips 'em upside-down. why do they divide by one? i don't know. i was not there either. they wrote division by one into the problem. yeah. so i wrote it too but it really didn't help me very much. i think my, attention span's kind of wearing, thin over this short period of time. are you guys really gonna are you gonna do four-seventy-five now?     when i'm done with cl- with this. i should email John and    hm? probably not. it's supposed- it's supposed to be Saturday six A-M to six P-M also yeah i thought so and that's why i didn't park there today. i did but i was like i was already fifteen minutes late. yeah. and i was like oh... right above D-P-S. oh yeah. that'll be really good. but it's the third floor i'm figuring who's  you parked at NUBS? no i didn't park there that's where all this stuff, lives. i thought we were gonna meet at NUBS but then you, never said we were so i d-  oh what if we do like one guess and check will that give us a good idea? on this? yeah. yeah let's guess and check   she didn't teach us the sys-  i don't know why you multiply but that's what i would think we have to do first. no but what- okay so what multiplies? i don't know. that's, your job. the inversion doesn't multiply does it? well one of 'em has to multiply. cuz if you look on where you were looking at those formulas that you like? uhuh where's A-Z-bar? right here. A-Z-bar. all over negative-negative-Z-bar minus A... so let's see we have K-squared, all over Z-bar minus A, plus A. oh yeah. okay.  okay... and we want K... let's try making K equal... maybe just like one. no? i wanna make it equal something else. cuz i'm trying to get the plus three out. K-squared minus A-squared. K-squared, is gonna be, what we don't know yet minus A-squared, so this is gonna subtract four... let's try square root of seven. okay. so now, this is gonna equal... A, Z-bar, plus, so negative-two wait we can't have A equal negative-two though because our inversions are only centered at the origin.  not on her thing. across a circle centered at the at the origin is a hyperbolic reflection.  i don't, like it to be zero. well what is a, what does a tran- what does a, um, reflection do? the straight-line reflection? yes,  right here. that's what i said. that's what you said? so it's negative-Z-bar, plus R where R is, an arbitrary real number let's say, three? okay but what did they do... i guess so they just... what if you have a ticket? what if i do? uhuh. it's twenty dollars. i, mail in a, check with the ticket and, pay it off. it's my girlfriend's car so i'm not gonna like make her pay it. yeah. i don't know. if it was my car i might just leave it on there but it's not so i can't. i feel bad it's like, i drive my parents' car so i'd never do that. never do what? leave a ticket. never pay a ticket. oh. why wouldn't you pay the ticket? you just leave it. because some people just don't pay the ticket. mhm yeah but then don't they like hunt you down and take you to court? only if you get a bunch. yep. or if t- i mean if you get a ticket later on and they'll pull you over and they'll be like oh, you have an outstanding you know but if it's like one outstanding parking ticket and you'll be like oh i didn't even know. oh i see. you know. it's like oh i forgot. reflections in the bowed geodesic have the form oh once i got two parking tickets in one day. it was like a couple years ago but i was so mad. so let's- let's just like take a guess. let's say we're gonna take you know i think we can't_ reflection over a vertical line. so let's do one of those. yeah we're gonna have to do one let's do that first. yes. let's do it first. okay? let's  they did it second, but. well let me see. if we look  let's do it second.  alright alright. okay  alright. no. i will make myself clear. let's do, the kind that we, let's do the kind over a vertical line first. and then followed by inversion. uhuh. reflection, across any vertical line we want  let's do reflection across, three. but do you know how that, how does whe- what it's across affect the equation? i think it's going to like how does the negative-one apply and, relate? i don't know  well you have to know what it's across. no you don't look get rid of- this is the equation negative-Z-bar minus two just take a negative-Z-bar plus some number. oh. reflection across... reflection across, let's do reflection across but a reflection across, a, vertical line, not located on the Z-axis, it's the same so if if it's, reflection across the Z-axis then we have one over Z-bar right? yeah you know what's cool about what they have is they have like negative-Z-bar. yeah. okay. so, if we wanna reflect across like, three, then it'll be like negative-Z-bar plus three or negative-Z-bar minus three. okay all i'm saying is that's not what they did. i don't think it is either. but  do it like that? alright so let's do three. let's do negative-Z-bar plus three? minus three so let's do minus three. cuz that they ended up with positive numbers so let's do that. okay. that's what we're doing. yeah. okay so, I-zero, square root of two. negative-Z minus three. so what does that equal? that equals two? right. over minus oh wait. over, what are we doing on the bottom again? Z-bar, so it'll be oh we take the bar of that. yeah.   okay. the inversion first,  okay. use_ how about we do like, okay so you wanna do square root of two? yeah. i'm trying to get two-Z to come out. that's what i'm working on. cuz we have to get two-Z, to come out and be on the bottom. that's why i think you can't, have, it have to be over, the origin. yeah she may have messed up when she said that cuz they didn't. yeah and how else would they get something with two Zs in it and we didn't? well they even, they even said maybe she meant the X lookit their inversion is centered at negative-four zero. yeah   do what we want. i think she meant the X-axis... like centered in on the X-axis.  yeah  so... we have... do you wanna do it the same way they did? invert first? let's invert yeah let's  yeah so let's do, inversion how about centered at  no i wanted negative-three zero. okay let's do negative-three zero. R, Z, minus alright square root of two over um yeah. okay well we're just playing around let's see what numbers we get and then you change the numbers that was the whole point.   i think i've, did we say square root of two?  so that gives you two, right? over... Z-bar, plus three, minus three. yeah. and now let's reflect over well uh, shouldn't we, let's see what that comes out to,  well yeah we wanna, we don't even we have a Z      mhm. a reflection composed with an inversion, should give you like, centered at, zero zero is R-Z minus K-squared over Z. but, we need the opposite so don't we have to do like, inversion and then the rotation i mean it didn't seem to work, but... i think we're, gonna be good off if we start with what we have but, if we start with inversion. like you have inversion composed with rotation or rotation rotation_ reflection composed with an inversion. sorry. but now see that gave us, a negative-three-Z-bar. and that's really not kind of what we wanted. no it's not what we wanted. but let's keep going. followed by the reflection Z-bar, minus Z-bar, minus, what point do you wanna put in there...? i don't know... so how are we gonna get a two-Z on the bottom? well this is looking, is this gonna be maybe two inversions? i thought about that you know it's gonna have to be because you got Z-bar and then you gotta get Z back. right? yeah we wanna end up with Zs not Z-bars. but they did. they ended up with Zs. yeah but, um if you reflect, it doesn't matter. oh yeah cuz they did oh yeah cuz you s- when you reflect you take the bar anyways.   if you reflect it doesn't it doesn't change the numbers in front of your Zs. see what i'm saying? why not?   so let's let our inversion be, over negative-two comma zero are you able to even get like, Z over, like a, some kind of number? this is what i get, something like this,  how does it? well it will it's gonna change what your, it's gonna change what your constant is up on top but but if it doesn't, cha- it doesn't matter what the constant is yeah alright how do you change what you get in front of the Z on the bottom...? let's invert twice... because we want to flip it over. so we wanna get what we have and then  i agree. okay. let's try it. so let's invert over negative-two zero first. and then let's invert, over the origin. that's what i think so what radius do you want? invert over what first? invert over,  let's do what they did. let's do the square-root-of-five. cuz like what if- what if you get what they do, and then you like, invert it over the origin or something. yeah i think we wanna do the origin next. don't we wanna use one of the numbers  questionable. but why don't we just i'm just going to use general Ks As and all this other jazz. okay.  and radius one.  so minus-two-Z-bar minus three? over Z-bar plus two? you are a lot faster than me... yeah. oh. yeah. so then... we really wanted a plus three.  mhm okay. so let's keep it that way over Z-bar plus two, and now, let's invert again okay. we shou- i think we should, keep radius one or something. keep radius one again? i don't know. well let's keep radius one. so this'll be... so you got a one on top yeah. so that's, negative-two-Z minus three, all over Z plus two. so Z plus two goes on top. and there's a plus two, after that? no there's not? that's all. so that gives you negative-two-Z-bar minus three? yeah... i don't like that. i can do it with three reflections i think. yeah. so that's Z plus two, over negative,  yeah we are close. it's two reflections. i mean if we did one more reflection then we would get it. because we would do a reflection over a vertical line. yeah. no you you wanna you gotta stick with two because you gotta get the Zs back. you gotta get Z-bars and you gotta get Zs. we're close maybe we just gotta, change something just a little. alright so instead of doing this second inversion so what the thing we need to change is the, center of the in- circle of inversion. right?  okay. i don't know i don't think_ i i stopped thinking that guess-and-check's gonna work. i thought i'd be- i thought we'd be able to see pretty clearly what the numbers were how they were being affected  so which ones have we left so far we've left one-B one-B and three-two. right? yeah. and? didn't we leave one more? no. we've got we did all of two we did all of two. we did one-A we just have, four to do... so we got number fifteen right? mhm mhm definitely. alright. yeah let's do number four. yeah i'm sick of this problem. okay. let me get some water. alright. my voice is getting hoarse. i'm not sick of you guys really. oh we will don't worry... okay let's see- these are i don't know i thought so but no we're still alright. just wait and see what happens. so what's our cut for this? hm?   you get two birds with one stone.   yeah.  i'll have to bring food. yeah. treat us  you sound like a- kind of like you're mooing like a cow. no i didn't say Moobius. no but it sounds like, moo.  i didn't notice, anything weird. i didn't really notice that much until she told me. how could you guys not notice? she's like not speaking English when she does that she's like Moebius. a Moebius transformation... okay. number twenty-one. yeah did she tell us about fixing points in here? um it was just the last class we went to yeah for that particular point you want F-of-Z equals      that's that's my impression. so you get, two over... two over Z so now let's put in, F-of-one-plus-I, right? well you get two over Z-bar, according to this thing. so that's  two over one minus I.   now you    equals, equals so inversion I zero equals two, two plus two-I equals one plus I it works. yeah. it works. da da, da da da da you guys are brilliant i woulda i woulda just crossed it out right away without even trying it. this would_ i don't_ am i an idiot? yeah but we still like you.   yeah it was your idea. so i can't believe i didn't_ see i i_ you know it made total sense because you have that circle there and its  yeah he's like inversion... across circle, of radius, square root of two centered at one. so now we do twenty-three. see? this was easy wasn't it? okay. i'm still kinda glad we didn't start with this one. like Christina wanted to. hey. what is a double-fixed point?   two distinct real roots. so it's fixing one point in the boundary five and seven so of H-squared they're on the X  n- no. yeah it's a parabolic. translations don't fix anything do they? no. it's on the boundary. negative-three's on the boundary. i thought i don't what why do they what is negative-three? oh    it is. it is on the boundary. okay oh twenty-three i'm doing twenty-two sorry sorry sorry. stop doing that. i am just i am totally    that means i wasn't sure or something. um no that means she said we thought it would be some kind of translation? who? she's like she's i'll leave that, as an exercise for you to do at home. in your spare time. yeah in all the spare time that we  did she used to ask that?   yeah, we did ha ha ha she's like i guess i'm gonna have to put it on the homework then. every parabolic isometry is conjugate to the map F-of-Z equals Z plus one. so how does a translation fix negative-three, out of curiosity? i- i- well why don't we...   yeah. this is,  do do do do C-Z-squared. plus D minus A-Z minus B equals zero. woo hoo man alive. they're doing (deep life) out there. it's a good thing you had Herb w- out there with you to help you open the door. yeah um, i'm not quite sure what happened. alright what's going on? anything? anything good? yeah well what happens if we have to solve this equation, C-Z-squared, plus, D minus A-Z,  no. C, Z-squared yeah? plus, D minus A D 	1
LES165JG121.json	let's see so (xx) okay before i forget, i better hand out, um i do have device evaluations, forms for you, several of you have been asking me um, when i'm going to get to this assignment that's on my schedule. um i... planning on setting it up this afternoon probably early... and it will be set up, in our offices, as long as you call and make sure there's someone to open the door there you can come in, any time between you know regular business hours between like nine and five, uh, i will be there, Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoons... um, and for this assignment we'll make it due, what did i put on the web? December fifteenth? uh no i didn't put December fifteenth on the web  yeah it was how long does it typically take? i think it takes about an hour for people to go through the, um, advertisements and, look at the device. um, i'll send an email around with what device it is, and you might be able to shortcut that by um, reading, advertisements on the web, or documentation on the web. and if you absolutely can't make it during business hours, we can talk about some time in the evening or something like that but that's always harder to set up, since, i like to go home, you know. though staying to six isn't any great, hardship for me. okay this is the first of two days we'll be talking about augmentative and alternative communication. and so first we're gonna kinda talk about what is communication... and one of the things that we obviously think of with communication is speech. so i have our system model of a user here (or) a person, and what different things can go wrong with speech... producing speech. um they may not be able to control their tongue or the their mouth in an appropriate way to form the words so people can understand. so they could have a problem with motor control... that's one place where things could break down, in producing speech. any other places, that things can break down in the production of speech? they might forget the names of different objects or okay in the memory or cognition. they could have aphasia. okay an aphasia would be, one diagnosis for forgetting, names though i tend to forget names and, nouns occasionally and don't necessarily have an aphasia but... let's see here's three. it is is it Wernicke's aphasia that's the, understanding (one of) say again? Wernicke's? Wernicke's aphasia, is damage to Wernicke's area of the brain it's actually, i think that one goes with the, the understanding cuz that's the connections from the hearing, area of the brain to the, the rest of the brain. so what are aphasias? well, an aphasia is a problem, either in, the perception when you're not perceiving things right. and an aphasia basically is a, difficulty in understanding or producing speech that cau- is caused by brain damage. um i have an uncle, who has an aphasia and has very much, confused, very much confused the doctors when he was a kid in, you know late nineteen forties, that, they'd take him to one doctor, and the doctor would, sound a tuning fork in his ear and he'd look around and he said you know, he can hear fine i don't know what your problem is why are you bringing him to me? they'd take him to another doctor, the doctor would talk to him, and, he wouldn't, understand or respond, and they'd say well, he's deaf you know, what are you bringing him to me for? because he can hear, he can play the piano, but he cannot understand speech. that part of his brain, that turns, sounds, um into, symbols i guess into intelligible, words is damaged. and it's actually kind of interesting i i, when i talk with neurologists every once in a while, i will, talk to them and, ex- describe my uncle cuz they are all very interested well, you mean he can write and he can play the piano, and he can read but he can't understand the spoken word well that means it's probably damaged right in this part, and it's a very small lesion and they get very fascinated, so, you know i amuse the doctors every once in a while by describing him. so in understanding the speech, you can have a receptive aphasia that is where the perception, damage in that perceptual, parts of the brain that are involved in hearing and translating what is heard, into something meaningful. you can also have, an expressive aphasia where, you can still produce the words fine. the coordination works well, but maybe you can't remember the words, or maybe um, the words that you remember as having a particular meaning are not the words that everyone else who speaks, your language remember as having that same meaning. um, there's a fascinating Star Trek Deep Space Nine episode, um called uh Babel i think where, everyone came down with expressive aphasia uh, due to some virus. but it was one of these conditions, where, it can be very frustrating, cuz you know what you want to say. you may even only have the expressive form of aphasia, so you can understand what everyone else is saying fine, but, you can't produce speech you can't get anyone else to understand, what you're saying, that, makes perfect sense to you. and either, there's something wrong with everyone else or there's something wrong with you. um... other things that can go wrong with understanding speech, um i put deafness up here even though we aren't going to talk about it today, um, we'll talk about deafness when we talk about the other sensory impairments... your expressive, aphasia, can be, forgetting vocabulary, it can be not being able to put things together into a sentence, that has, you know t- forgetting basically the rules of grammar, and the rules of sentence structure, that are appropriate for the language that you're speaking.  okay, can bring the dysarthria or the apraxia, um, getting the coordination getting any coordination can be very difficult, with cerebral palsy. and, much as, we're pretty skilled at it, speech is a very, coordinated function. you think how much earlier we learn to walk than we learn to speak. um, it doesn't take that much coordination to stand up and walk around. but to produce all these, complex sounds if you don't have diaphragm, control you can't get the airflow that (xx) (might need to.) okay mostly it would be an airflow problem. uh it takes a very high level spinal cord injury, to, basically you have to get injury into the brain stem, to get to the actual nerves that control, the mouth and tongue. but, you can take out, um all the breathing muscles with a much lower level spinal cord injury. and cancer can do a variety of things as well, that's one source in which you can often get, the vocal, damage to the vocal system. um you'll see people who've had, cancer of the larynx, and will have their larynx removed, so they don't have vocal cords. um, there're actually little devices yeah Jackie? oh what about if there were brain tumors would that ever affect, like parts,  but it oh alright i saw someone using that it was pretty neat. it sounds a little bit  to like add additional, like functionality or to add something, that's you know to what's already there. okay, so to, enhance, or to add to something. what about alternative?   okay different from the norm you're replacing something essentially. so let's see, to augment to make greater or to increase, an alternative is a choice between things i think i was raiding my Webster's Dictionary again. um... so it's important when we're looking at assistive technology for communication, that, we rely on both of these. we wanna have, we want to augment the person's, whatever ability they have. and it will be very rare to find, someone who has absolutely no ability to communicate. now the communication may be very limited. it may be, facial expressions. it may be shaking their head or eye blinks for yes and no. but, there's some, usually some communicative ability that a person will have. and you want to utilize that, in the situations you can. however you also want to provide alternatives, um if the person wants to become, as fully functional as possible. and, Rebecca gave us a very nice overview of lots of different devices, and, actually there are some that i'm familiar with like the one that's going to be demoed, that you didn't get. but that's because there's like stacks and stacks of, these devices. i think communication devices may be one of the most, varied devices. because it's one that, someo- some engineer will have a child with a disability who can't speak, and, not really have a connection to the assistive technology that's available, not know what's out there and come up with something, themselves to solve their child's problem. and then of course their friends hear about it who also didn't know about the assistive technology, and they start a little company, and then they suddenly hear about RESNA or one of these organizations and they go and, to, you know to try and sell their wonderful product that's going to solve everybody's problems, and find out that there's actually quite a few products out there already. and some of the companies survive and some of them don't. but uh, it's, there tend to be a lot of little devices that are_ do very similar things, but have been come up with by different people... um, augmentative and alternative communication is typically used to refer to, uh communication that uses something other than the person's own body for communication. however, to really be effective you often want to, use a multimodal communication. so you want to use communication, that combines different aspects. you know if all you wanna say is no, you really don't want to rely on your Pathfinder and, p- typing in the right buttons. if you want to express to someone, that whatever they just gave you to eat you really didn't like, there are far more efficient ways than typing out i did not like, what i just ate. um, probably a, a face, people you live with. you talk to people you live  family roommates people who see you every day and know you very well, Jackie? people in like, commercial-type settings at a store or a restaurant or something like that where, they don't know you, so  questionable coworkers and fellow students. okay acquaintances. coworkers fellow students. people that you see, often enough but, who don't know what your favorite kind of ice cream is. teachers okay teachers, who also don't know what your favorite kind of ice cream is.  yeah yeah do you mean that you write vertically instead of horizontally? or    you compute   okay, so here, i've gotta put my first number, here. and then i gotta hop up here, and carry something. and so while i wrote these, left to right, i'm writing my answer right to left. so, if you've ever tried to, get, you know do mental arithmetic in your head and then write the answer down, in Microsoft Word or something, either you end up, doing all_ the whole thing in your head and then writing the answer down, or you end up writing this, and spacing over, with the arrow keys to get to where you want to put the next number, and it's an awkward form of writing. it can be very difficult, if you're a child who is just starting, to understand addition, and suddenly you have to deal with, you know not only do i have to learn, the addition but i've got to make the computer that i'm using to do my, written work, work backwards. and for that matter work backwards down here but not up here... yes? i have a question about that last slide of types of communication. i would think it would kinda be an issue also with nonverbal communication i kinda feel like, i don't know like probably a third of the things that i communicate to people are just with gestures and if i could- didn't have that ability like motor control or otherwise, like a lot would get lost do you_ is there ever a case where you could try to compensate for that? um, you can try to compensate. mhm um, would someone with an aphasia be able to, i guess they (wouldn't) be able to communicate with like sign language. depends on the aphasia. um, if in my uncle's case yes he actually was educated in a school for the deaf, because they could teach him, American Sign Language, and you know knew how to deal with someone who you couldn't talk to, and have them respond. um, so if, if you have a massive aphasia, that may, those areas that interp- unders- that would translate American Sign Language could be, damaged as well. um he apparently had a fairly small, um, area that was damaged and actually at a, at a very young age. and that, is an incredibly important thing in the brain. you know how, young you were when a damage occurred. because a lot you know the brain really doesn't stop developing, until you're in your teens. which i don't know studying the brain is just a fascinating area and i know very little, of what is known about it, but i know enough to know that what is known about it, is very little, of what there is to know. so, gotta give people some very nice complex, things to, transcribe there. see, so when we talk about how fast, do we talk? how fast do we communicate...? um, speech, when we're talking conversation, they claim is about a hundred and fifty to a hundred seventy-five words per minute. um, if you're typing, they claim you can get up to a hundred words per minute if you, are really good at typing. now, i- i've only gotten up to like seventy when i'm taking a typing test, there are certainly things that i type faster than that. i can type my name and password, very quickly. i can type the name of the computer i typically log into, very quickly. you know so there are certain things that my fingers have learned just to whip through. and my mom claims that i type faster than, seventy words a minute but you know, it's hard to do that on a test on a typing test. um, if you actually have to, decide what you're going to type at the same time it really slows you down. um they say about fifty words per minute. if you're only a one finger typist, people claim ten to twelve words per minute. now, i think there are one finger typists who go faster than that. um, if you're going through a scanning system, you're actually doing pretty good, um if with letter by letter scanning you get up to three to five words per minute. and that kind of brings up the question, how fast do you have to communicate, before people will stop, engaging you in conversation, or will just get bored waiting for y- the next thing you're going to say, and wander away? why not? kay some sounds what would, what would the communication system be doing, to control that? Jackie? maybe with different languages?  maybe   uh you can understand some things your uncle says you could, have some computer that would understand those same things and translate them into what the written thing  yeah hi kay, say hi. you see a friend if they're, with a friend, you know, did you see that, episode of, what would it be um,  uhuh uhuh, yeah, i see, that can be hard to generate on a communication system. they actually have communication systems that will be set up with just you know a one button, that would generate randomized different, uhuh, okay, mm, you know. 	1
LES425JG077.json	today we're gonna be talking about, stage-structured and size-structured models. again, uh matrix models, following up on the, the, topics we've uh, discussed earlier. mostly we've been talking about, age-structured models or it's Leslie matrix models. now we're going to um, talk about some variations on that theme. um, at some point i take it painted turtles become non-reproductive right? when they reach the upper age of the, adult class. is that right or is that? i mean cuz that cuz the initial graph the number looked really low for, you know point-five-two-eight seems like a fairly low value. so it i- i mean is that_ am i reading that  oh no, i was just_ that meaning that makes sense. because i actually thought that they would uh have more eggs than six. it seems like a small group. right. that's six female eggs. okay okay female eggs okay the total yeah the total clutch is uh, bigger than that. yeah and in in um, cases where it's been looked at, uh, looked at closely, there does tend to be an increase in uh, clutch size with female age. but sometimes it's hard to detect in in all the noise. because i th- i was thinking in harvesting that it it'd_ well i guess what i was getting at was i was thinking i know like you know you could place maybe size you could actually allow harvesting beyond a certain size if that's somehow correlated with age class if you could say those were no longer reproductive, ahh yeah absolutely absolutely. in fact, i've, been getting some uh, e-mail messages from some of the, uh turtle experts around the state here. and uh, Southeast Asia is apparently a hot spot one of the hot spots for turtle evolution, and there's a large variety of species there. they're coming under increasing pressure from human consumption, and especially as the economies improve in Southeast Asia, uh and all over Asia, uh, turtles are harvested for meat and it's severely depleting the turtle populations. that additional source of mortality on those populations because they're taking the larger adults, puts a severe cramp on the, uh the population growth, over there. well and over here too. um, the poaching of turtles in, uh in in Michigan and actually just even incidental harvest is really hard on the, populations they just can't sustain much additional mortality on the adult stage... okay, good good question good question. let's uh lemme get back to, follow up this comparison here. the way to do this is to, uh have the adult elasticity value, times the percent change that you think is gonna be from this plan five percent and that's, works out to point-oh-three. so that's a three percent increase in survival, uh excuse me three percent increase in population growth rate from that plan. so, three percent of the, uh, nominal rate of point-nine-five brings it up to point-nine-seven-eight-five would be the value projected under plan A. under plan B you take the juvenile elasticity, times the twenty-five percent increase in, juvenile survival, gives you a point-oh-five, percent increase in lambda. so lambda would increase by five percent to this point-nine-nine-seven-five bringing it almost up to a stable population. if you were using those really small time steps, like back in the diagram on the previous slide, why wouldn't you  whoa jumping ahead excuse me. uh, there we go. ah, good point good point that's right. if your if your uh time unit was sufficiently small then there might, there might be uh, a loop here as well. that's a good point right.  where would that go on the matrix? that would go right here in this, this one, this first element. the probability that, the first stage remained in that first stage. good question good question. anybody else? whenever you talk about those turtle populations i always think about the uh, study that grad student from Central Michigan was doing on wood turtles in Manistee National Forest, while we were up there. oh. oh boy. yeah... the raccoon, the raccoon population is just so high... yeah. i remembered this (person.) somebody else asked about that too and i can't remember who it was. i don't know. w- have a- have a good weekend. 	1
DEF500SF016.json	okey-doke, uh well Kim Sook was gonna do another, very brief summary of what he's up to. uh to bring it all up on our screens... alright, um... first of all i'd like to thank all of you, for agreeing to be on the committee, reading the draft, and coming to the defense, being, with me at, my last moment of, graduate school     wait for the others um, my presentation will be extremely short. mainly because i presented most of the data in a proposal meeting, and also the four studies, reported in my dissertation are, very simple experiment so, i think that by now you may have clear idea about what this dissertation is about. could you maybe push that up uh the uh, the the light part does it work? which one where? so it'll be a little bit  the the top thing uh yep um well don't worry about it  if you just take the top mirror and grab it won't it tilt a little bit? yes yes yes. oh yeah. is this a test? thanks hm  uh, well normally it's just a quick, run-through but i don't if people wanna do it on a on a you know just... in this, fashion common on the fourth floor (whatever) i mean cuz there're various points of which, i think i might wanna want clarification and or comment on certain things okay well  uh, including the, first five words. um, an unspecified interactionist theory naive theory. one possible interpretation of that, which in fact was the interpretation i made when i first read the um, the abstract was that there's a class of things called interactionist naive theories, and you're not gonna tell us which one it is. but now, as_ after having read it that's not what you meant. is that the case? in other words, there could be tons of interactionist naive theories. and but it's sort of a mystery, and you're not gonna tell us, you're not gonna specify, which of those theories you're talking about. but that's not what you mea- you're meaning by this term, is that  alright  yeah i i i guess it's just a matter of of presentation i mean, i- it would seem to me that in situations, where you are in effect, inventing a term, it might, make more sense, to start out right at the very beginning, th- saying what it is you mean,  right okay um, the, Hou Fun Ma another, student here, now in Stanford, used dialectical reasoning. meaning the same thing, as i do. mhm to_ on the last point i would've, um said that allowing, science, um allowing conviction and debate isn't enough you need to encourage it if you want, things to happen allowing is a fairly, it's almost a negative word you allow something. (uh) mo- many people will not, do something if it's merely allowed. but, i was under the im- oh i was also a bit surprised about the wording. because it seems that, i mean even encouraging debate, um, would not necessarily get you, to scientific, enterprises i mean you have to develop some consensus on how you're going about, accepting things as evidence and so on, which... right right c- certainly only necessary conditions, far from  i i'm still curious why, um, you wanted to do the, thing you brought up just at the end about uh making, different cultures look, equally good since it didn't have anything to do with your thesis. i mean as far as i can tell. i i don't understand the connection, uh there and i wondered why a little cultural difference here between our field and your field well okay if that's the answer right actually i thought you did  right yeah i mean it's, i mean the first two chapters i thought were masterful in that respect, um... i mean it is a fact of life. you know in a in a situation where you compare cultures and people are very sensitive about, this type of issue well until the last paragraph of the thesis it never occurred to me that one was better than another, then suddenly he, pointed out to me that, the whole thesis had implied one was better than another, and um and i thought that was interesting. hm  well if if you want smooth relations among people, then a culture, um that, does that better may not do science well but, but that's a separate value judgment which you prefer and if you wanna do science well, you probably just can't have smooth relations among, people to the extent you can in uh, in an interactionist culture. but he does start with a very strong normative, claim you know and that is the set of descriptive, results of a very strong normative claim and then there's this thing called the fundamental attribution error, and Asians are not as susceptible to it, so there is a strong_ (that is  well, no he makes an evalu- he makes a very s- he makes a normative claim he's actually, further out than anybody on this although i'm pretty close to it, in mak- in making a normative claim about_ there is an error that's made and that, the, epistemology of of East Asians uh is such that they are less likely to have... yeah... okay so they're better? in that respect. i was concerned, with other's reaction and i, could feel... i mean i didn't, mean that, Western thinking is better, in all sense it's better for s- doing modern science... but some of my, you know well i i th- no i think it's fairly clear Western thinking is better if you're gonna do science but that doesn't mean, that it's better, in general. there_ it's it's not as good for other things. right i mean if  mm. hm' okay well i just  i just wanted to ask alright i i i must say that uh, uh... the Baltes link at the last paragraph did not save it for me. and that, i mean if all there is to be said, for the advantage uh, of dialectic reasoning or interactionist theories is, that you may i mean kind of approach the, indecisive state that Baltes kind_ that right right? and i mean it's a classic aging effect i mean that's what he's saying and i mean in  right i mean he could i- it reminds me i mean i mean, my prediction_ i may be completely wrong. but i mean uh, Roger Dixon for our you know recent aging and (xx) book has done a review of what are the gains in aging are there any gains? and i mean the only gain you can identify is is Baltes is a increase in wisdom of the the Baltes measure, and other than that, uh what has typically been labeled gains is really just, the slowing down of loss i mean there are some domains in which the age-related loss is less pronounced than others, and for some reason people have preferred to call this gain which is a politically correct move because, you can't be accused of ageism either as little as you should be not accused of culturism or whatever the other isms may be, and uh, a- and that's getting, i i mean well i i more thinking of um coping strategy, so for example in marriage, the divorce rate is, quite lower, hm  in some sense but they have this, this belief you know there is ups and downs, so you can not make yeah yeah  d- d- did you also feel like, political questions were being raised in the last page that weren't, otherwise, so much to the forefront? i thought the very_ the whole, first two chapters were about that. i mean just not necessarily put in those terms, um, i mean that was my interpretation of it that's why i said i thought it was really masterful, the way he did_ the way he dealt with that, but they certainly are issues that uh come up in virtually any conversation you're gonna have, about stuff like this. they i- they will come up, in almost every talk. i mean in one case i, i think i told you about it was i gave a talk one time, and there was uh, uh a Chinese operation researcher in the audience who became very indignant, about the whole proposition of the data, and attempted to come up with all kinds of explanations that the Chinese subjects they w- just happened to use were, dumb psychology, subjects. you wouldn't get the same thing if you'd used smarter students. um uh and in the first two chapters i thought he handled it beautifully, and, i agree it's just the last page i thought wasn't, um, up to the first two but that's okay i'm not objecting but you you you were bothered by that you (know) somehow (it) raised_ made things more political   well uh well i i don't actually remember the last thing i'd have to look at that but my interpretation of the first, two chapters was i think the way to go that you got two different ways of approaching certain kinds of things and, the real issue is under what conditions, are they likely to be more functional. and uh, i see absolutely nothing wrong with that in fact i think that is the best way to think about, stuff like that you know where specifying the conditions, under which they- they're functional or not so functional and then let the reader, do with it what he will, that i agree with well, w- we've seen that there are these, reactions and we should yeah   (and to) put in a slightly different context i don't know how much time you wanna spend on this but i_ i i've in the past had_ occasionally had to do, research which got me rubbing shoulders with physicians and, ph- physicians are to, psychologists as Asians are to Westerners that is, you'll say something like, uh, you know i think you know, the basic process is this and they (throw) ach it's much more complicated than that. so what's your interpretation of um when you're in, the culture, conflict of psychologists and anthropologists?   okay um... w- what do you think about this...? s- i- i'm not sure this is the right term but it's almost like, gets to be something like a moral issue. within, this culture, it's sometimes considered morally, unacceptable, to do, to be as you would term it interactionist. it bothers Americans for instance that, people are inconsistent uhuh yeah i mean um, um, if you um... if you don't consider, two opposite side at the same time, and stick to one side only, then you will be considered immature, in, my culture. so, maturity goes, along with, being interactionist. is more desirable, in my culture. so, uh i think that is that is cultural difference. in terms of socially des- what is socially desirable, being straightforward or being more complex and indeterminate...? you know so i r- i um, gave some review about, the cognitive dissonance effect mhm so, although i mean the cognitive dissonance effect is hard to replicate even this country, in this culture, but there is no, es- to my knowledge there is no success of replicating, dissonance effect in in Asia. meaning that we are less concerned with internal_ being internal, consistent. i'm not quite sure that that actually addresses the question i mean, let me see if i can come up with an example a better, description of... it often bothers at least in my experience a f- Americans when they see, one person, behaving in very different ways, in different situations. there's almost a moral charge, to be consistent, so like to use your vignettes, if you are a good person, you will do good things, regardless, of the circumstances, the demands. uh, am i am i out to lunch on this? i mean have you guys ever heard anything like this, i mean, or have i have i just come from a, strange subculture? no no i mean certainly what you just said is true, of people of the Americans i know   well the the local way is that well that's exactly what you just said i think well if he lied in this he lied in all yeah A- Asians would never come up would never, would never,    it's an America- but you said American. um yeah i mean maybe my perception is i mean, is not quite right but i mean my_ i've certainly been in s- in a lot of situations in which, uh, people observe, somebody and say gosh, he's really behaving differently here, than he did last week under other circumstances what that says is that the guy has no moral center if you will, uh, and so, but you don't see like, an issue of morality at all in this this is not the way these things are at all, seen within these kinds of cultures you're talking about? i'm not saying there is none of this but, but we are concerned with being, consistent but it's less, and, i c- i cited one study, which is not published yet, um, the study shows that, Americans are more concerned with internal l- let me try an let me try an example and see what you, what your prediction would be. i i mean suppose in the U-S i say you know at the seminar that i think that theory X is, let's say Fishba- the Fishbaden-Aizen model is a stupid idea, uhuh hm  yeah the the Clinton issue is a  we don't no the furthest we'll go is not to say anything yeah yeah... yeah... so then you  yeah yeah  but so but how so for Koreans are they in fact um- i mean Germans here Americans here, Koreans there, is that, that's his prediction  it depe- well i i don't want to say depending on but, depending on the status, whether y- whether the speaker is your senior, junior, when your speaker is student for example then (the) teacher can say something really nasty. but if the speaker's your advisor you cannot say that. so sometimes it's okay sometimes it's not. mhm. Galtung in the course of his essay, there's this wonderful essay, i don't know if i told you about it by Galtung, about uh Saxonic Nipponic uh uh Gallic and Teuton- and Teutonic uh, styles of intellectual argument. it's it's just it's wonderful    uh uh about uh thing but oh yes right no that that the uh that he starts his example, with the example of um of the, American professor right that that the stupidest thing that an undergraduate can say to a professor is oh that's very interesting this opens up a whole if you just trim it a little bit fix this that's right so i mean the Americans all just as complimentary you know, seniors and juniors... well, maybe more like the Americans with, with anybody at least in a public situation i mean that, you sort of go out of your way to be polite and to not offend, um, and, and i suppose another way you can get at the same phenomenon is the ques- is in the notion of being honest, and i think that things like this, have been discussed on occasions in, in the context of negotiations. so, in negotiations between say American and Asian companies. Americans have often been taken aback and have felt that they've been lied to, because certain things were said, in that particular context and they come back and, and people are behaving completely differently, from what they thought, mhm  actually Jeffrey, Burks and i'm, doing a study about, indirectness in in communication what we did, was to give subject, a vague, verbal evaluation, and we asked subject to, translate that verbal evaluation into scales. and we found that Americans student tend to take that verbal evaluation directly at face value, so they made more errors. because they couldn't see he   by um, uh, their their own cultured person... but Koreans were more accurate, in the sense that they could pinpoint the hidden meaning, so they couldn't take, the communication at face value... so they are they are more concerned with, understanding the hidden value of the communicator. well, that seems odd in that (this all) just what you would expect, that you'd have to do right i mean if yeah  right well either you, you regress uh, but what's odd about that is that, the Americans, would not behave in accord with their experience, so is it, i mean so, why shouldn't the Americans expect when if they're dealing with Americans, people'd say what they mean? oh so you think that when Americans say something good about you, Americans don't take it at face value, is that  well i i don't know i mean, my colleague my, fellow student, seems to take, oh you don't?  sometimes i do   then i take it. actually Jeffrey Burks has a piece, a lovely study he's just done where he has, the actual things that are said by, uh American, evaluators, to their employees, when they don't (we) know from their ratings, that they think the employee is pretty crummy. and, you now give that transcript, to Americans, and to Koreans and ask them to say what does this guy really think, of the employee? Koreans get it right, and Americans get it wrong. hm  there's something wrong in this. i guess   well you have to learn in this culture, where we see this most dramatically is that people who do a lot of hiring, uh learn that no letter is ever bad and they have to read it much more carefully, and people who only hire occasionally get it wrong and hire the wrong people. um we see this quite a lot and... yeah well there's just this enormous main effect in this society i mean more than any other industrial society of of, being nice. mhm well if we write a bad letter we might get sued so we never   oh i mean i'm i'm keenly aware of that because i write letters for German students and for American students, and i could never write an American letter, for one of my German students for a job in Germany. and that's the other thing i'm a complete idiot, you can't say (of me) you don't say he  there's a very substant-  temple, there's a very marked temple effect here, i mean there's been a huge shift in the la- in recent (fac-) every decade's worse and worse yes very good at at this point we only have genius graduate (students) right, and it goes up from there plus the ones who are even better   uh, Kim Sook, i have i have a very different question there's another theme in this which is not a cultural theme, i mean which you turned into a cultural theme but, i mean there's a more, straight psychology theme in there which is the role of surprise in, judgment and reasoning. you wanna say a bit more about that or, are there angles that, you would wanna add to the discussions that you had...? i i have not i have not been aware of a of a real (a novice) of a, of a systematic treatment of the psychology of surprise and its role in, in judgment and so on i don't think there is any there really isn't much there right i mean, this is, this is um, based on nobody's research. but um, i i read, much of Berlyne's epistemic curiosity book, so, he made implicit assumption that surprise is a necessary condition for epistemic curiosity, but nobody actually look at the direct relationship, between being surprised and, other consequent behaviors. so, um, well you are right i mean i just took that, assumption, in my   i think um, uh what i said, is not different from what you said. i, i look at the uh after-the-fact effect, that is, for example East Asians  mhm but surprised i mean y- you're still i mean saying it in a way, that surprise necessarily requires falsification of a, of a theory, rather than noticing that something is unusual i mean couldn't that be surprise just by exposure, to a low-probability, event, you have no theory why the probable or the improbable would happen i mean i just notice that this is different,  i mean i had a conversation with a, Korean developmental psychologist, a couple days ago who was visiting Carnegie Mellon, and i talked about this research, and i said, okay suppose one scientist, made a claim that a dog can fly... and he said well, i can, construct a theory, story why, dog can fly. and i said it's wrong i mean if if you can, construct a theory, or story, then you are wrong i mean, you should not do that. so, even if, there is no no there's no theory required, just if they can construct a story... so, then they, would not be surprised so it does not maybe require, just a theory, whether they can make a story or not. is that? and um... assuming he's said enough um let me make my comment which is that in in natural science what he says is absolutely true. that if you don't have, th- there's just tons of historical examples where, you sort of know something and until you have, u- until theory gets up to the stage where you can find it surprising, it's just there and you don't do anything with it or respond to it and then finally you have a quantitative theory, and then it doesn't fit and then, you go (hm') tha- that's um, partly why, you hear stories that at the end of the last century people said that, all of science has been done and there's nothing left to do and so forth, uh it's because there were tons of facts around, but they didn't even have the framework for them, and then slowly the framework came and they realized that, they didn't fit at all with the previous ideas, that they didn't incorporate them (enough.) so, i- it's a strong point in, but in everyday life i, i find it less strong as as you're saying so is the idea that, there were these facts and things out there but nobody had bothered to, even ask whether they reconciled with you don't know  okay but what about this i mean, how do folks, deal with this question of what the whole point is of having a theory? i mean, why not j- simply exist i mean why do you need a theory? for us that's easy. i mean the whole point is to understand nature. right    alright th- that might actually get to an even more fundamental issue which i'd be interested in hearing your your thoughts about, which is, in day-to-day life what actually is the point, of even considering questions like this i mean so, right w- well i don't think, everyday-life theory is articulated as, theory in physics i mean the simplistic people have, their, theories but they_ sometimes they don't, realize they do have theory. so, i don't think many people are bothered to have their own theory explicitly... okay well, let me ask a related question. could the real core here the core at issue here, have to do with expectations, i mean so, intuitively it seems to me that, you are surprised, when something, turns out to be inconsistent, with your expectations. uh, how does that idea, reconcile, with the work you're talking about here? um, that's, for example in study, one then two, both cultures expected that in study one the target person would help the victim. when the target person did not help, which should be surprising right? okay okay alright right is there any possibility that, one part of the difference might be, how firmly held the expectation is? say in the ambiguity sense? well, i mean that's why i'm interested in conviction. mhm i mean do you remember how ambiguity is construed, in decision, making i_ it's been a long time since you've,  mhm (xx)  yeah remember it actually is a technical term, i mean, to be distinguished from probability. so one loose way that is sometimes interpreted, is that it's almost like probabilities about probabilities, so that normal probabilities that you would talk about as discussed in this thesis, would be sometimes referred to as first order, probabilities, and then you can talk about, things like the distributions, over those probabilities, mhm right right yeah, i'm also, um thinking about the distinction between confidence and uncertainty, mhm mhm well that that that  right so, right so i- in terms of confidence, there might be no cultural difference mhm yeah yeah that might be worth pursuing  right suppose someone were to ask and i i'm, it occurs to me a reviewer might, do this say well gee the it's a lovely, treatment of all this that you have but why don't, why don't you do the, simplest thing which is to make people make a prediction, and then say guess what, you're wrong. and what would what happen then s- if you were to do that. well how would, Americans respond how would, Koreans respond. um, well if i'm_ this is right then um, Korean would still be less surprised... why? because they can, um, explain why, it didn't work out that way. suppose that in the Bayesian sense, uhuh. i'm i'm lost. okay. there, are in general two different ways, that you can, go about assessing what people expect to happen. mhm right uhuh well i hope that's that's the case. i expect that would be the case mhm o- on the f- face of it, it seems to me that um, if you have, Americans with, simple-minded models of the world, uh and Asians with complicated models of the world, and then you ask, people for predictions, Americans oughta be more confident. because, not as many, alternatives are being considered. uh, and yet, we know, that, it seems to be at least with respect to some things that Chinese are more, overconfident, than Americans. so how would you put those? i think that's why, Joe and i think that we needed to distinguish, confidence from, uncertainty... so in, uh, overconfidence, is a measure of confidence. (just) i think it's a statistical term (it's) a technical term not an everyday life term. right is overconfidence yeah well yeah there is a specific way you measure it i mean right so i think the um, conviction is everyday life term and i think that conviction is, is maybe more, reliable indicator of behavior than, overconfidence... so, i mean that's why, i put discussion about, Joe's work abo- about overconfidence and, um, my thinking about conviction. that's a_ uh it seems like Asians are less convinced, have, less conviction, yet they have e- at least equal level of confidence in terms of a probability. so unless i think a w- unless we solve that, problem, um, i mean they will just, continuing, confusion, confusion about, that word and this (word) okay but, suppose i'm a reviewer, and you make this proposal about this conviction thing, suppose i say well jeez, it's just a word, conviction, i mean, can you, in effect operationally define conviction? i mean, so i would like to see like if i'm a really serious Bayesian type of guy, i really want you to put your money where your mouth is, i mean how can i know that somebody's really, convinced? rather than just says that he's convinced? um and this seems to be especially problematic since you're cutting across languages right, Bob Abelson, um, wrote something about conviction so he developed some, criteria to measure conviction okay okay why would you not take the Bayesian tack? which is, put your money where your mouth is. so, um, i can do that and you would expect that there would be differences? i mean i'm not familiar with the Bayesian, approach so, i mean i feel, comfortable with, the conviction (rather than Bayesian) but... what's your what what would be your assumption i'm still, not so clear about the basic process what would be your assumption, when you um, put your subjects under load...? so that they um, have limited cognitive resources and they can't run through the various complexities. what what what would you expect? so you think that under heavy cognitive load, subject will behave just like Asians? so they cannot yeah i i i don't know, i mean on the one hand you could say on the one hand you could argue, that Americans become like Asians by s- you know saying ach i'm not gonna work through this thing i mean, you know, a- and you give the it depends answer, on the other hand you could say, that Asians become like Americans because they can't work through the complexity of these interactionist theories, and they'd go with one rather than the other. uh i'm i'm i'm not really sure what i would  yeah i think, to me um Asian way of thinking it needs, you know, resources, cognitive resources these are active processing of information so, if they are under heavy cognitive load, they will be like Americans. they, just choose one over the other. but for Americans i don't know what, outcome   they would not be no they would not be no not in that sense yeah i suppose you un- unless un- unless you un- unless you do, the listing tasks, where i'm sure because i mean there you present right right right uh this may be related to a conversation that, uh Kim Sook and i have had, um, periodically. i mean he he writes as if, he thinks, uh, Asians have... almost elaborated or articulated right   right. or is there no theory at all? and all i do is is basically right  right  right right Americans i- if it's, Americans oughta become, more like, well either of you guys could probably articulate better which way, what kind of result speaks     right  yeah and  yes i know but yeah that would be a yes yes i i think i've got the way of characterizing these two possibilities for Asians. are Asians like clinical psychologists who've got a million theories and you can't surprise 'em or are they like your mother, who knew it all along? well... in f- in fact the- there is few clinical psychologist in Korea but there are as many mothers, as here but many mothers right so... let me ask one um, question about the thesis, itself um, while i pretty much agree with your conclusions about, how these cultural differences affect cognition and affect the development of science, i think in the thesis itself there's a pretty big extrapolation, from your results to the conclusions you wanna draw about science. um so i guess, he- i'm just, curious if you thought a little bit about, a few future experiments to fill in that extrapolation and make it more, um, concrete to draw the kinds of conclusions you (made) about, you know, those effects. so between, (for example sup-) this thesis and science right? well your (bring)  well you're making theoretical arguments  i'd love to hear from you well i haven't thought about, what experiments would do it but it seems to me that there's a gap, that would be fun to develop some  Kim Sook, um, on various, occasions in the thesis, you say things like the following. you say yeah, i did. okay you_ and and you're reading it differently i i suppose oh no i'm reading exactly what he wrote, uh no i mean what if, um...? okay le- let me let me tell you what i'm     so they  right because they can explain, with their theory... do your data really, allow you to say that...? well i mean it's a it's a, it's a whole issue, in, emotional research for example, when, unless you measure like ph- psych- physiological, reaction, so when i say oh i'm surprised, then you don't, you cannot determine whether i really mean i'm not surprised or i just report i'm not surprised. so tha- that's a separate issue, i mean, i- it's like, wait le- let me give you an example si- it's not a really good analogy but it's sort of close, like i was really shocked, years ago when i was on a review committee and i started reading stuff in, well i had to review a proposal that had to do with, cultural differences in language, language perception, and uh this particular study had to do with peculiarity from an American's point of view, o- of Japanese (uh) confusing Rs and Ls, and it was a psychophysical experiment and they conc- well the experiments and they concluded that, it wasn't simply a matter of, not_ people not being able to say things in terms of and things like that they literally could not distinguish, the physical sounds. the difference between Rs and Ls. that's different, from reacting to them and saying well, uh, and it's, and it's sort of like here is it that people don't really see, these two facts as being inconsistent or they simply, treat, the inconsistency differently? and i'm not entirely convinced and i'm i'm hoping you can,  if the the s- i mean if the second one, is the case, they just treat contradiction differently, then why, do they do that? politically correct possibly how do you know they're just treating it (differently?) no that's what i'm, asking i mean i don't  b- you should able to distinguish with an experiment that's Joe's point but i'm not sure these experiments do you think these experiments are capable of doing that? if not then what kinds of experiments could you do, to distinguish them? hm, so they see contradiction but they just, react   right right it's a good question too yeah, i got, the exact same question at Illinois when i gave a job talk, and, the questioner, wanted me to develop experiment in this part so my answer was that okay  if they if they give you that job right, you do the experiment as many (xx) and you do and you go for P three hundreds so i gave two, possible exp- experiment one, you can create a public setting, and private setting, because their their assumption was that, Am- Amer- Koreans, wanted to be polite to be respectful to experimenter, so, uh they want_ they don't want to their expression, so you can create, private setting versus public setting. or, you can have a panel study, so you can look you you can measure their reaction, time one, and then, sometime later, because, initially you may have reacted differently, but the more you can think of in private setting, you may want to express, that reaction more frankly, so what would you think of a Hou Fun, approach to this? suppose, say in these kinds of scenarios you have, you have the Americans, to, in essence explain, why they consider, these situations to be contradictory. and then you see what the Korean subjects think of that reasoning and vice versa. say again? is that? alright, one of the things that Hou Fun did in his thesis, was to have subjects, to look at arguments right well it's, what's to do, i mean, that's the best answer i can give, so i mean you can, i mean we, have, various argument, write about the scenario and ask them which one they prefer, or which one sounds reasonable i mean i can yeah well, just something to think about yeah... i mean, your last point is, quite good i mean cuz, if they are really truly interactionist there is nothing to explain, seriously. these are all, questions that are easily translated into studies right when all else fails when all else fails, let your subjects talk to you... there're four hm? there're four experiments oh well but, but, one and two are really the same experiment oh okay i mean, i was surprised that um, you, do not see the connection.  (actually) to me,  so he, so he's obvious- he's obviously not Korean doesn't have a good interactionist theory um, um, my_ okay here is my, answer um, if you have a interaction theory, then, you don't see a contradiction as contradiction. so you would not be surprised by surprising and contradicting   okay everything depends right. i thou- if you've got an interactionist theory then everything depends but, if everything depends, then it's harder to see a contradiction right yeah i think so yeah clearly the third one is. flat contradiction doesn't make something more surprising than if it hadn't been contradictory... um, people don't seem to see that, the hypothesis that was confirmed and the hypothesis, that was not confirmed are suf- sufficiently different then you should be more surprised, than if we didn't know about that competing hypothesis which also seems (a failure to,) recognition, contradiction, and, how is the first then how is that an instance of, failure to recognize contradiction? because, for example in study one they expected, that the target person would help, and in fact, he did not help. so that should be taken as a contradiction okay so it's an implicit implicit contra-  right right so right right okay other questions...? um, okay, you wanna give us a couple minutes then thank you 	1
LEL542SU096.json	um the class today is um, recorded, for um a database, for the, Program in Linguistics is that mhm well that, that the Holocaust is seen as a reason for self-censorship or, something it's uh, yeah to be prevented so, y- you have to look at everything as, you know whether or not it's it's, good for the Jews or not. you know what kind of, position it will, place them in i think i mean this is supposed to take place in nineteen fifty-six something okay that they don't view it, which way? well i mean the people don't uh, you know like at t- at the time it seems like, the Holocaust was mostly, really only thought of among, in the, within the Jewish community and it really wasn't something that was, you know discussed outside of the Jewish community it was more, internalized and uh, it was more of a, of a w- something that, Jews felt, um that they had to, prevent from happening by, you know conforming to, you know what any kind of expectations they thought, that there, that there should be for them. but i think that since then i mean i think it's, um, you know left this real kind of, parochial, kinda mhm but, yo- you're right i think i think you're right that um, that it's changed somewhat although i i th- i do think that the reas- um, like Roth is coming to this, is reviving this um, this issue, because it's not completely, it's not completely um, an- an- something of the past. and i think that um, it's still, the Holocaust is still, is still used to, to censor um, people to to, give um, it is used for um, for um, providing oneself that the um, self- self-righteousness for, for um, giving, oneself moral superiority. exce- except it doesn't seem like, the instrumentalization is necessarily for some kind of like, outside, pity or sympathy it's more an internal form of, just kind of censorship or, mhm, it's in general that the, the judge is also concerned about the image that this writer is projecting right i think he's arguing for more of an artistic truth that says, um this is the effect it had, on my, family. and mhm mhm... um, he's, he does, argue for artistic, license he also, argues that um, that the Holocaust is not, is not, always relevant to to what's happening, in the American Jewish community that it doesn't always have to be, to be brought up and, and there's a, there's that um comic passage on, on page one-oh-six in which he's, arguing, with his mother over this, over this letter that Judge Wapter, sent him. um, would someone who has the book, please read the, the pa- the dialogue...? maybe someone in the back so that, the people in the back can hear. Susan would you want t- to (use?) where is it? where do you want me to start? um, can you start  mm, they're those these are two Nazi um, officials. (actually) and i,  Belsen uh Bergen-Belsen is a concentration camp and this is the camp where Anne Frank died.   he's saying that they're different, than the Jews (at Belsen.) and that um, i i think he's sa- i see i don't think he, um, the writer, Nathan, i don't think that he, thinks about the Holocaust at all, to me it doesn't seem like he does. and he thinks that, well maybe a little bit but that he, doesn't mean it comes into play with what he writes and, his views. so i think he's completely separating, these people from, the people over there.  i didn't really understand the paper you know the pa- the paper project that was due (xx) we're supposed to do. um, pick one or two of the terms and, and answer the questions. it's really open-ended so like how could it be, (xx) do you want us to use our, texts that we recently read? uh, you can refer to them. but we don't have to? um... you can- it's really an open question. it's it's something that, you know that i want you to reflect about it so if you, if if there are things that are relevant in in what we've discussed, alright.  yeah it's very open. okay alright, are they gonna be due tomorrow? no um i'll have them due again on Friday... alright. hi i was wondering if i could get my midterm. (xx) aren't you going to be here at the end of the second hour? tomorrow? no today. i'm turning in all the, i'm i'm handing in all the papers. so, can, can you wait? um, i've got a three forty-five that i have to make and then i'll be probably still be finishing up... i know (that um, you've read the papers) great thanks. did you uh, there are a couple newspaper articles about it a couple weeks ago about the uh female Holocaust survivor who just became a rabbi. did you hear about it? she's the first female Holocaust survivor (as a rabbi) (xx) where? mhm (yeah, yeah well,) yeah. that's not surprising. yeah. um, if you have your coursepacks here the last page of um, i think it's the last page of the coursepack, is a handout... um... that, juxtaposes an excerpt from the diary with, an excerpt from the, from the play and and part of the, the dialogue here will be, in the scene that i'm going to show you from the movie. um yes. so what are what are your, your reactions? sorry i can't, i can't help but snicker i shouldn't. i think it's more positive than, other, other stories about the Holocaust at least, that's the way (it appears) i don't know if that's exactly, if it's just (straight from) her, diary. um, well, the um, the last line that they are, that they're quoting in spite of everything i still believe that people are good at heart um, was in the diary but it was in the, it was in the middle somewhere part of the entries and, and her diary, is um, is, much, much less homogeneous in its, in its optimism in its in its positive... positive thinking i mean she, she goes, since it's a diary and it's written, um, at the moment she goes from from uh, days where she feels good to days where she, where she she despairs. but the the play and the, movie have chosen to emphasize, the positive um, positive sides of the diary. yeah? they also seem to emphasize like um, like a universalism, attitude i mean just comparing the, text from, from her diary where it's all about you know Jewish suffering and mhm   and this is a, this is a, a passage in which she expresses uh feelings of nationalism even chauvinism and um, and then the, the playwrights have uh, completely turned this upside down and Philip Roth talks about that too where he says how, you know y- if Anne Frank had come from some you know some Orthodox family you know Eastern European you know it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact as you know, pretty much, i mean sh- sh- could almost be like a typical American, girl at the time. right. um actually, i think i've, was i was planning to (communicate) this message of something similar and, let's see... right le- it's on page one-forty-four i'll just read it to you, um what page? page one-forty-four, one hundred forty-four. they're all almost all positive ones that she'd been (part of) so, you don't see like, the really big stuff that's displayed in the books and stuff. you don't, yeah you don't see the horror right? you don't you don't see, yeah Susan? yeah i i think that's why it makes her so popular too just, p- that's why she's the one everyone knows about because she's not writing about the horror of the concentration camps. she's not, telling about how it was she's telling you about hiding. and that, granted i'm not saying that was easy but that's completely different than, you know people who write about the actual camps. mhm mhm Santo yeah i think the Holocaust it is like removed but it's present in the fear of the characters, that she like talks about, sort of, people in the, attic. the thing is is that, there are so many authors that wrote about the camps that she present, she presents such a different perspective, that that has to appeal to all the i- like, it's probably the world like it would appeal to all the readers than those that would have been, reading like writing after writing after writing, the same thing. i mean it's_ everybody had their own individual experience but, they were all in the same location, i mean some, type of location whereas like there's not like that many writings of children who were in hiding. and also she's a child, or she's a child she's a teenager so like, her diary goes through like, her interest in Peter and like her family and it lets you into her life and it's not just the concentration camp or just the Holocaust i think it gives you a whole perspective. um, Mike? yeah just like an, an example of like the way it's constructed the play it's just like an inspirational story like, like people love why people like, i mean maybe cuz it makes them feel better about themselves or even their own kind of, pretty good situation compared to hers it jus- it's just like, an example of someone somehow, you know raising their spirit and and, dealing with something so horrible so positive, mhm (xx) she's not just, lifting her spirits she kind of, redeeming her in in in the book they uh, they try to send Nathan Zuckerman off to see the play you know to like, cleanse his, soul of all these, you know bad ideas and then, in the last scene there she's simply ministering to the, to Peter up in the up in the attic like the light streaming in on her from the, from the window. yeah um she's, um there's, a lot of uh a lot of um really good things have been said but the idea that her, her story is obliterating, the horror but it's also uh redeeming, our, our idea of um the human spirit. i- i want to um, read you, um a sentence from the preface, to the um American edition of the diary. and the preface was written by Eleanor Roosevelt. um the President's wife at the time. and she, wrote that Anne bo- Anne, Frank's book made her, i quote  okay, good. one second. running home Philip Roth kind of puts it in, religious tones too when he has the idea of uh, you know, Anne Frank dying then sort of being resurrected. yes yeah right. right she can only be a saint if she, if she died. if she, if she had, survived she would be, um, her her experience, of um hiding for two years would would be of no consequence even though it would be, would've been the same experience and and um, also um, worthy of, of knowing. but uh, you're right. and and uh, Roth read by, by resurrecting her is also, um refusing to to uh, to preserve this sentiment- sentimentalized image and, he turns this, this imaginary Anne into um, into a cynical, um, a cynical survivor... um, at the ending of, Roth's novel is uh, acting the um um a direct response to to the ending of the film, um, he's um he's mocking this this kitchy, uh Hollywoodish there's also kind of the part when he's in the study at night like listening you know like a lot of, you know Anne Frank had to do with you know these people listening you know, waiting to hear people come up the stairs and so he's listening and he hears these people who are, you know getting to bed or you know whatever like yeah  is the final due next Thursday? yeah. the final will, because you'll have a week to do it so, okay 	1
LEL485JU097.json	uh, okay uh, now that we've studied optics, um, we're, in a position to talk about, the two, theories which pretty much revolutionized physics in the twentieth century. uh, what we've been studying up to now, we've we've pretty much worked out by the year nineteen hundred, and it's fine, for uh figuring out things like you know what somebody's eyeglass prescription would be or how a generator works or so on. uh, but uh, the theory of relativity, and quantum theory, together, have_ were both developed in the last hundred years and they really revolutionized the way we look at reality. uh, to some extent also they've they've had a, well not just to some extent, to a large extent, they've had an influence on some of the_ they've made possible some of the modern inventions for example, uh our knowledge of how the atom the nucleus works would have been impossible without knowing, relativity and quantum theory. uh computers, transistors uh the invention of those, depend completely on quantum mechanics. without quantum mechanics we'd never, have um uh been able to build a computer. uh, in the time we have remaining we can't um um, go on to great detail, in these theories but i think it's worth, uh it it it's very worthwhile for you to at least have a taste of what they're like. uh to get some idea sort of a working knowledge, of what the basic ideas are. and, today we're going to talk about the theory of relativity and then again some more uh tomorrow. uh and then uh after that we'll be talking pretty much about quantum theory and the structure of the atom. um, relativity um... the reason, we think of it as being revolutionary, is the theory of relativity has changed the way we think, of space and time. you may have heard of space-time, relativity and so forth. e- essentially what the nature of the distance between two points is with the time intervals, what that is. uh also uh, the theory, pointed out something that had not been suspected before, and that is that mass and energy are, just different aspects of the same thing. um, that's the famous equation, E equals M-C-squared. today, we'll probably be talking mostly about the uh uh the space and time aspects of relativity and the basic ideas, we won't have time to say too much about the equivalence of mass and energy. you have a couple of homework problems for tomorrow, uh which are concerned with that and so i i think after you have a chance to read the book and and try them uh, probably uh what i have to say perhaps will make a little more sense. um uh but we probably won't get there uh the mass and energy part of it today. um, as you, i'm sure, know, the author of the theory of relativity was Albert Einstein. and actually Einstein um, was one of the leading, um developers of quantum theory as well. in fact, it might be just, as_ for a sense of historical perspective, let me just give you a a forty-five second sketch of Einstein's early life. he um got his PhD in Germany a little bit before the year nineteen hundred. but he couldn't get an academic job at a university. in those days instead of having slews of professors, each university had a professor, you know of physics or something. and he couldn't get, couldn't get a job. so he ended up um as a patent ics- inspector in Switzerland. essentially what he did, um was uh people would would send in patent applications and Einstein would look at the application and see if it made scientific sense. uh but, while he did this he continued his interest in, theoretical physics. and in the year nineteen-oh-five, when Einstein was twenty-six years old, he published five papers. and, of those five papers one was probably nothing special, but two of them, contained the entire special theory of relativity. a th- another one, um... suggested to, scientists a way to determine Avogadro's number, with precision which had never before been dreamed of. um, in those days Avogadro's number, the number of molecules in a mole, wasn't known to much better than a factor of two. but Einstein wrote a paper uh, which involved_ which you may have heard in in chemistry, Brownian motion, if you haven't fine, uh but essentially he suggested by studying this phenomenon, uh one could measure Avogadro's number, with great precision. and it turned out ten or fifteen years after he made this suggestion somebody else did it and won a Nobel Prize for physics just for doing that, for taking Einstein's suggestion. the remaining paper, was one in which Einstein invented the photon, the basic quantum (of) electromagnetic radiation, which was one of this was one of the key steps, uh in the development of quantum theory. so in the year nineteen-oh-five, Einstein did quite a bit. and interestingly enough, um the_ he won the Nobel Prize for physics. uh and he won the prize for his invention of the photon. he didn't win it for the theory of relativity, which presumably would've, um you know would've merited it. uh actually, neither of the two theories, the the idea of photons or the theory of relativity were accepted, by very many people until fifteen or twenty years had gone by. Einstein wrote these papers in nineteen oh five. and it was the nineteen twenties, before, um, people became convinced that yeah, he was right. uh... i said that um, the fact that we're through studying optics now puts us in a position, to uh discuss these theories, uh and that's certainly true of relativity because light plays a central role, in the theory of relativity. Einstein was concerned uh with the, behavior of light. he was interested in the various features of light. although more generally, what relativity is really about, is the question of what two different people, in motion with respect to another, relative to one another, when they look at something happening, or they measure something, the distance between two points or the time between two events, the question is what do these two guys get, if they're in relative motion. and uh, his starting place was_ uh well at at least a technical term which we'll use quite a bit, which we might as well define now, is that if you have two observers in relative motion, they're said each to occupy a frame of reference or a reference frame. we're all, at rest with respect to one another. so we can be thought of, as occupying, a frame of reference. uh, for the mathematically inclined we could put a coordinate origin over in that corner and so then we'd all have different X Y and Z coordinates, in our reference frame. but, by definition we're in the same reference frame because we're at rest with respect to one another. but now suppose i walk by you this way or maybe there's, a car and it coasts (by us.) i'm now in a different reference frame because i'm moving with respect to you. uh f- of course, i could carry my own coordinate system along with me, you know, if i'm coasting along like this i could say here my coordinate system's moving like that. i'm at rest in my reference frame, but of course when i look back i see you guys moving now right? you know so basically uh, uh we now have the two reference frames because, i'm in relative motion with respect to you and vice versa. okay. now, it turns out that Newtonian mechanics, classical mechanics, has built into it a feature which is very useful, and certainly simplifies things. and that is to say, if you're in a s- a so-called inertial frame of reference and we'll define that a little more in a moment. in any inertial frame of reference, Newton's laws of mechanics work perfectly well. an inertial frame of reference just means one that's not accelerating. so for example, uh, you could say if we're just sitting here i mean the earth's, going around the sun, so there's a small acceleration but if we just sort of think of you know the earth sort of sitting here, we're in an inertial frame now, and if i move past you, moving at constant speed in a straight line so i'm not accelerating i'll be in an inertial frame. uh a reference frame which is not inertial would be uh, for example a driver in a car which would be going around a corner. then what would happen is i'd see things looked like they'd be pushed against the outer door, uh because i'm in a non-inertial frame. you know basically there's no force pushing you now but then you wanna go straight. and so, and if i continued in an inertial frame, the objects would just sort of continue with me but when i turned this way, i'd be in the accelerated frame, trying to go straight. so it looks to me like they're uh they've suddenly started moving. but anyway if you're in uh, any inertial frame, the laws of Newtonian physics work just fine. and what that means is, that, you can assume, you're at rest in your own frame by definition, and you can assume you're at rest and there's no experiment in mechanics you can do, which will contradict that assumption. so, let's take a concrete example. you'll see what i mean. suppose i'm in oh you know a, a something coasting along like this at constant velocity, and i throw a ball. okay? now, uh what you see because i'm moving as i throw the ball in the air, and it comes down and i catch it. and of course from your point of view, the balls are passing you know like that. it obeys, Newton's second law, F equals M-A you know, downward force causes there to be an acceleration and has an initial, upward velocity this way. and so, applying Newton's law i should say well, (what i'm gonna) do is this. fine. but now from my point of view, in my reference frame, i'm at rest. you guys are moving that way. but i just throw the ball straight up. well once again you know, F equals M-A in my frame too, but i- in my frame, it has an initial velocity like that, but no, horizontal velocity, so it just it goes straight up and, straight down. but neither you, nor i, is especially entitled, to say, i'm the one who's at rest and you're moving. basically either one of us, can say, i'm at rest. and apply the laws of mechanics, and they'll work just fine. um, Einstein was very impressed, with this principle. actually people before Einstein, had noted it also and it was called the principle of relativity. essentially that the laws of mechanics, work equally well in any, inertial frame of reference. Einstein felt that, uh, this must be some fundamental underlying simplicity of nature that it's telling us something. and so what he wondered was well, should this be true not just of the laws of mechanics, but how about say the laws of electricity and magnetism? um, and... there seemed to be a problem, when he did that. uh because it appeared that the way the laws of electricity and magnetism were being interpreted, in nineteen-oh-five, it appeared that not all inertial frames were, on an equal footing, that there was one special, inertial frame, and only that one, could be, considered to be at rest. and to illustrate where the problem comes, let's just think about light. um, you remember that according to Maxwell's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum, you know you can calculate from (absolute) (xx) and when you do the calculation, you come out with three times ten-to-the-eighth meters per second. okay. but now the question is, the light can travel through a vacuum so the question is three times ten-to-the-eighth meters per second with respect to what...? see the the vacuum is nothing. you know, uh d- suppose you're floating out here in space and a light pulse goes past you. and you measure its speed and you say oh, three times ten-to-the-eighth meters per second. fine, that's what was right. but what if you have some friend, that is moving this way, at two-thirds C, two times ten-to-the-eighth meters per second, and he looks at the same light pulse. and he measures the speed of the light pulse with respect to him. would he get three times ten-to-the-eighth meters per second? well you'd say probably no because he's moving, and, you're at rest. but you see, if we wanted to apply this so-called principle of relativity, to the theory of light, we'd have to assume that neither one of you, could say that you're the one that's at rest and the other's moving, each person should be entitled to say he's the one that's at rest period. apply the laws of electr- tricity and magnetism, and everything should turn out alright. okay? uh, and so, what Einstein did, was, feeling that, this principle of relativity really was a powerful principle. he said despite common sense, what we will assume is, we will simply make two postulates. one of them is, that the principle of relativity applies to all laws of physics including those of electricity and magnetism. in other words, no matter which frame of reference you're in, you can assume you're at rest, do any experiment you like, make any measurement you like, and there'll be nothing to tell you that you're moving. the fact that absolute motion is essentially meaningless. you know and essentially we we every day we sort of assume that you know, here we are we're at rest here. but of course we're on the earth and the earth's moving around the sun the sun's moving in respect to uh distant planets and so forth. but basically what Einstein said was well if you're in an inertial frame of reference, anything you do, um nothing you do rather, can tell you that you're moving. now, uh what does that mean? well i said he made two postulates. well, the first postulate, of s- relativity is simply this so-called principle of 	1

Ailanthus trees, are particularly good at growing next to our house, if our house is built on a concrete foundation which most of us, have. because Ailanthus trees, really like the, calcium carbonate, that concrete is made out of. fact sometimes, you can, see where old homesteads, used to be, and there's nothing left except a field or maybe a few small trees, and growing mysteriously in a square that might not be otherwise explained, is a bunch of little, Ailanthus, trees of heaven. and if you go look carefully, spread the briars away, you can find, the foundations, of an old house. trees, and hedges, hedges are things that we sometimes have in our, landscape these are made of low bushes all grouped together, to look like a fence. trees and hedges, and sometimes vines, play the role, of casting, shade. we may, want the shade, we may not want the shade. we might want the shade at certain times of, year and not at other times of year. so thinking about, sun and shade, and where we want it or don't want it, when we want it, and don't want it, is an important thing for us, to be doing, as landscape gardeners. spring and fall equinox spring and, fall what? solstice equinox, spring and fall, equinox. and equinox means what? equal day and night equal night, equal night night is equal to the day. and that happens, in the spring and fall. and then, in the summer. and the winter.

LES205JG124.json	okay so we have to watch our grammar today, i don't think i can do that. um i, i wanted to thank you guys for coming out on the field trip i thought it was quite interesting i hope uh, everybody, um, appreciated, i know it was a bit of a, long time but it was a beautiful day so um, an- any comments about the field trip anyone have any thoughts afterwards or, was it helpful to get a a picture of the site (there?) it was very helpful. i think there were maybe, only one person unfortunately couldn't make it so tha- that was good. um, what i wanted to do today to start off is to just uh review a little bit about pump test analysis i feel, that i'd perhaps covered it a bit quickly, um last time and i just wanted to go through some steps, on how you'd approach context analysis and i thought we'd go through, the unconfined, analysis example that i sort of um, st- stuffed over a little bit last (time) so, um, the first thing i want to do is start to t- talk about we analyze data. and um, when we start with pump tests, we are measuring, water levels in wells right? so the first thing we want to do, th- you don't have this so everyone doesn't have to find it. i just did this this morning. um, these are just steps that you will take when you when you when you're looking at data analysis from pump tests. and it's it's it's embedded in your notes and it's just, expressed differently here so you don't need to, copy it down necessarily. but what i wanna, wanna ta- talk about or focus on is the what how you would interpret your data and, decide which method of analysis you wanna use. so we're gonna start there, so you're measuring water levels you have some idea of what kind of aquifer it is. the first step is to plot up, (from) calculate drawdown, and drawdown is the change in water levels. so you're measuring water level you record the initial value, and then you meas- and then you uh, record the change and you plot that up versus log time. and, why do we do that, i have the, short words there as to why but why are we going to plot up drawdown versus log time what information does that give us? it gives us an idea of when we've reached steady state. okay so, if we're conducting a test and we're plotting this up during the test, when we start to see this approach a straight line, we say okay it's the duration of our test is such that we'll be able to use steady state analysis. so that's one reason why we would plot it up this way. um, then the other way we can plot out the data is log of drawdown versus log of time. and the reason why we we draw that up is that's has the same shape as the well function right? so if we look at the shape of our data that will help us determine perhaps what kind of uh aquifer we have. and we saw_ this is in your notes. and we saw that, for a confined aquifer we get a very smooth curve that does not, that increases very rapidly, initially, and then, gradually at later time. but we don't, have it flattening out okay? and and then we saw that if you have a leakage, leakage issue you're gonna see it flattening out. cuz the drawdown will essentially stop increasing. so if you see this happening, during the test, you either have leakage, or, you might have, delayed yield because we saw that delayed yield also has this kind of shape. so if you're in, you're looking at your aquifer, and you s- see this flattening out, if you can you should run the test longer. because you'd like to know whether it's going to come up again, or it's going to continue to be flat. if it's a confined aquifer and it flattens out, chances are, that it's a leakage issue, okay? what other things could cause a flattening out besides leakage, anything else supposing we have a confined aquifer, and we see it thanks no idea. no do you know do you have any   you can have a lake or,  H-naught H-naught H-naught? i don't know if that's, what  yeah  maybe it's S-squared, if the units have to work out right. the units have  i think it's  yeah anybody find it in their notes anyway that's, i- you can see i don't memorize all the, equations right? but we would we could correct they call this correcting for dewatering, is what they call it, you would know the saturated thickness of the formation, so you could go ahead and make this correction. and then you could, s- apply your method of analysis so, that's one correct- type of correction. the other thing is, you might have an observation while during the test which is out of the radiuses of influence of the well, so it's far away and you can see a trend or a change in the water level over time. and this might this might be if you're conducting the pump test over a week's time period it's u- it's unusual to happen over a short period of time unless you have a torrential rain or something. okay but, but what they call is that is a regional trend, and you can correct for the regional trend by subtracting it out from all your measurements. so you assume that the observation you make at some distance from the well, is reflecting something else that's going on in the formation uniformly, and you apply a correction okay? so that's, another type of correction. there are other, other types of corrections that relate to um barometric pressure. if you have a storm passing by and you're m- and you're making measurements in c- in a confined aquifer, believe it or not the barometric pressure can affect the water level measurements okay? because because the height to which the water rises is in equilibrium with the pressure of the air. and if the pressure of the air changes, substantially it can influence the measurement, in the well. and so there are ways to correct for barometric pressure changes. uh another type of correction is for so-called partial penetration. if you have a well, that's not fully screened so here's your confined aquifer, and your well only penetrates the upper portion of the aquifer, and you're close enough in with your observation well let's say... the Dupuit approximation which, says there's horizontal flow doesn't necessarily apply anymore right? and in fact you'll see that there'll be some, vertical gradient. and you can make a correction for that as well. and there are analytic solutions that help you decide, what that correction is. but at any time or for any of these corrections what it means is adjusting the value you that you observed, to account for these effects. and if you, and you we- you're going to get introduced to these in lab just briefly, but if you really are, conducting a pump test and you need to, to look at these things you wanna get a manual of, one of the two manuals that we talked about. and they provide guidance on these corrections but the important thing is to know, that you may need to correct your data. okay? and you wanna correct the data before you plot it up again. okay so everybody understand that concept? so we've got barometric pressure corrections we've got regional flow corrections we've got partial penetration corrections we've got, unconfined, aquifer corrections... alright once we make our corrections to the data then we can, analyze the data for real, and we would do that by by plotting, again on a log linear plot and doing lar- using the large time data, using either Theim or Jacob Cooper or both, and we've seen how we can do that, and all that is is fitting a straight line linear regression very simple. and the alternative, is to use all of the data, and use a Theis type analysis. (um,) and we saw that the shape, of the, the drawdown versus time curve, looks the same as the shape of the well function versus one over U right? it has the same shape. and so that we can superpose the two on top of each other, and just by reading off the coordinates estimate, the transmissivity and the storage coefficient. so it's a graphical solution method, that works because the shapes of these two are the same. and in lab this week you're gonna be working with software that does this for you and, i've deleted all the part of the assignment where you had to do it on your own. okay so you only have to use the software, but i do want you to understand the process okay because, you never know sometime you might have to do it on your own. okay, but you'll only be using the software... questions about those concepts everyone clear on that? what is what is a large diameter well anyways? what is  okay okay yeah i, i- it's something, related to this, d- on the one, big pump test that i, did all the other engineers, were really concerned about the amount of solids that would actually be pumped out of the aquifer aquifer. they were, and they they were really clear in that we had to check the, suspended solids content in the water, with time they were concerned that we would actually be removing, solids from there. and i don't know why is that ever, is that a real concern or were they just sort of, barking up the wrong tree     mhm mhm  wells?  uhuh,   well a group of us thought that they were, nuts. oh well  they were just concerned in in actually in removing a a sizeable fraction of material. we often get mobilization of fines when we inject fluid   uhuh  sure that's right. does that look good? beta than before. what did you say? beta than bef- oh dear, how did you determine those points     okay    you can use three-point-one-four,  yeah that's what i got as, very good Dennis. yeah it doesn't flatten out. well it sort of flattens out, Sarah says it doesn't flatten out i don't know. it kinda flattens out a little bit, but it doe- certainly doesn't go back up again right? alright so, if you're looking at this curve and you're trying to fit it then what what you're gonna try to fit then, would be the, the portion... before it starts coming back up because it certainly hasn't come back up again you know? and it's truly an art, to how you fit this thing,  i'm sorry was the time long enough? no they should have run it longer. but this is the only data you've got, so you've got to try to use it, okay? so, so i guess i would sort of match it like that. and i'd try to fit the data that didn't fit before, to the earlier time clock. and i'd then i'd pull these data, uh these this match point off the, the curve, and i'd do the same kind of calculation. and if i, and if i perform that same par- that that same calculation now for these late time data, if if i do it, with a lot of uh, skill,  i'm sorry what is? beta beta is a measurement of, the uh ratio of the vertical anisotropy right. it's a measurement of the, the difference between the vertical conductivity and the horizontal conduc- conductivity right. so when you pick up a value beta you, you're guessing? you're guessing a different value for the anisotropy right. and there but there isn't an independent way of a- of measuring that unfortunately. now of course if you have a bunch of different wells, you can try, to use the same beta for all the wells and see if it works out. so y- that might help to give you confidence if all the data seem to fit the curve. and if some of the data don't then, it gives you less confidence in your estimate. everyone get the idea here though? i wanted to just give you a, a feel for this uh, matching idea. any questions...? yeah John? i- how well does that equivalent, when you can calculate that in equivalent hydraulic conductivity, that you're kind of averaging, over that area that of your, your the radius of effectiveness of that well, so to say right    mhm mhm and that's cuz you just probably don't have enough, data (there's.) there's there's two issues one is you don't have enough sampling points and what this is an integration, right sure if your  mhm yay  i think there are three yup, for each, eleven (D-I,)  elev- uh well uh, F-W eleven, (acid E) and I, (xx) so, that's all i'm gonna cover on aquifer evaluation tests but i i are there any questions? is everyone i, you can't learn all the all the details but i want y- i think you should have a good enough appreciation now, for where the equations come from, and how we use them, to estimate parameters because, because that's essentially what we do and once we've estimated the parameters, we believe that we can make predictions with the estimated parameters, that's the reason for estimating them right? we'd like to be able to make some predictions now, in your case you're going to take that slug test data, and you're gonna ma- get some estimates and you might be able to da- use those in your (modflow) model, as a a ballpark guess for the transmissivity. now i, um but you're gonna try to calibrate your real head data right? that's that's your objective so, you have to have an initial guess for your transmissivity or conductivity. but once you put that initial guess and you don't get the right heads then you gotta figure out well, how certain am i in this estimate? how much variation do i think there could be? you know, what other things could affect the heads i mean it's all gonna be your judgment. but you can start up out with these few observations of conductivity to give you a ballpark idea of what, what it, what it could be at the site and how it might vary. but ultimately you're not going to just take one number from that, from that test and use it in your model because chances are it's not going to give you a predictiv- prediction that's consistent with observation. everybody understand that? it's just gonna be, one other bit of information that you're gonna have about the site. and the more information you have the more constrained your model can be so, if you have some information about hydraulic conductivity you certainly don't want to put a value in that's three orders of magnitude different. it would be hard to justify, right? but on the other hand, just because you have a single value doesn't mean that value, is gonna be, spatially constant, okay? any questions? i i keep asking that, John asked them. oh i know i love those things. (i'm just)  it moves the same as the water. right, now, is that reasonable? no do you agree with him? i think it's reasonable. you think it's reasonable Sarah? okay it depends on the properties of the how about for um, dioxane what, (xx) dioxane what do you think is it reasonable? i, i think it should be. okay why? so that makes our project easier. well that's true, okay, but that's, alright i wanted a a physical reason. i mean,   okay, so for a s- a f- uh but you know you're right Sarah there is a reason why if it we could use the water motion to describe it okay, and it's because it is very miscible, and um they believe that it doesn't sorb very strongly at all to the aquifer we're haven't talked about sorption. but ba- i don't know how many of you have had four-sixty, um, are taking it now? Lisa shook her head, are you learning about sorption in there? kind of kind of? i don't think it's very  three-oh-three mass transfer where? mass transfer  three-oh-three. three-oh-three really? yeah that  okay   cuz it's going from high concentration  yeah i am. okay, so it's movement from high concentration to low just like, water moved from high head to low head so that's why the minus sign is there, okay. and, the proportionality coefficient is called, mass diffusivity so diffusion coefficient. okay, and it has units of length squared per time. does anybody know what the, diffusivity of typical like salt would be in water? anybody have an idea of the, magnitude of that it's, what kind of order it is? you can look it up in a handbook a chemical handbook but, is this like a really big number? in general does this thing like if you, if you watch this migrate because of diffusion, you have like a unit gradient in the concentration, does this thing go millimeters in a, in a, second or does it go, meters in a second or you know i mean what kinda (xx) millimeters (maybe) centimeters. yeah okay so even, even smaller than that okay, even smaller than that. it's on the order of ten-to-the-minus-five, centimeters squared per second something on that order okay? that's, that's the kind of order that you're looking at mass diffusivity. and, and i should point out here that this is a mass flux what we're talking about now it's, when we looked at Darcy's Law it was a volumetric flux right? it was the volume, per unit area per time right? that was a Darcy Flux. so this is now a mass per unit area per time. so the Darcy Flux is a volumetric flux, and and Fick's Law gives us a mass flux. and this, right here is just, to convert mass fraction, to, to concentration it'll diffuse back out  parabolic Brendan says it was a parabola, remember that? there was no slip at the boundary right it sort of looked like this.  oh wa- yeah, sure, um well i have my list that you gave me at the beginning of class i'm not done with it   right      do you add that, to the flux due to Fickian   two i believe two weeks you're gonna do a lab experiment, with a tr- tracer, and you're gonna you're gonna do this experiment. w- what i'm gonna do now, let's supposing i release, i pump water through this system, and at time T-zero, i the water i pump in has a certain, concentration, C-zero. and initially there is, nothing no tracer in the column, at time zero suddenly, i'm i'm inputting, uh concentrated solution, alright? if there was no dispersion and no diffusion in the world, this thing would move down with the average velocity, right? it would just move like a plug flow and if you've taken four-sixty or f- three-sixty i don't know what the numbers are anymore. you'd you'd get, plug flow reactors does that ring a bell? okay, you would expect sort of plug flow if you did not have any dispersion. but we have dispersion we have dispersion because of this tortuous path the solute has to take it can't go straight through a particle it has to go around the particle. so what actually happens is it starts out kinda flat and as it moves down it continues to spread. and the more it moves the more it spreads. okay, and if i_ usually we don't or we aren't able to measure along the column what the what the concentration really looks like. because it's, you have to put ports in the column with little probes and it causes leaks and it's a real pain okay? so instead what we do, is we measure what comes out the end of the column. and that's what you'll do. so if you watch what comes out the end nothing comes out the end at first right? and then after a little while you start to see, something come out. but it's not, as concentrated as what you put in, so it's dispersed. and this is what it looks like when it comes out. so it starts out low, and it increases finally to the value that you inject it and then it'll stay there. okay but there'll be a transition, over which, it will not be at the high concentration. and this transition is caused by dispersion. if there were no dispersion in the world it would come out right here. and it would go from zero, to the co- concentration that we input immediately, okay? but dispersion spreads it out, and it turns out that this amount of spread here, can be related to that dispersion coefficient. so you can estimate a dispersion aco- coefficient in the lab, from the spread that you observe. yeah John? how do you know that you're calculating the dispersion versus the diffusion? well that's a good question. i mean and,   i, can't, figure it out. okay i would, if i were measuring this it would seem to me that you're measuring, Fick's Law of diffusion   anyone have an idea how we might distinguish? is it that you have a, a set concentration in the liquid going through, at first, so it's not actually, dispersed, dispersing? it's not actually dispersing. well it is dispersing as it moves through so,  wouldn't you have a higher concentration at the center of your column, due to diffusion?   you mean, are you picturing the velocity profile like that? yeah but you know, it's not like that in a soil column. it's like that in a pore, but if you were actually to try to measure the velocity profile in a soil column, it wouldn't look parabolic. and in fact, a lot of times people think it looks fairly flat, you know. so unless you really go close to the wall, the velocity's fairly uniform. if you've packed it well. so, there isn't a lot of velocity stratification, but, well, i was thinking that we know what the magnitude of diffusion is right? we can measure that in a different experiment can't we? yeah we could we could look it up in a handbook, at a given temperature, right there are correlations that help us estimate diffusion. so i guess my argument would be, that we can separate the effects out because we we can estimate how much diffusion, would be responsible for the spreading, okay, and then, now, the only thing we don't account for when we do that is, (we imagine it's) diffusing in clean water you know, and we have these soil particles in the way right? so how would they affect diffusion if you got the soil particles in there, will they increase it or decrease it what do you think? decreases (it'll) decrease it right i mean if i'm a, molecule and i gotta diffuse but i bump my head on the soil particle i gotta go move around it it's gonna slow me down, right? so diffusion is tends to be hindered a little bit, in soil, and, so i would argue John that that um, if i measure a large, spreading, and i look at the order of magnitude of diffusion, and how much that could contribute to it, it's usually negligible. so even though it's happening, it may be negligible in comparison to the dispersion effect and i can estimate the order of magnitude by knowing the order of magnitude of the diffusion coefficient. so indeed i can separate. and we'll talk more about that next time because, as usual we're kinda jumping ahead. okay, so um, my understanding is Wednesday th- at, was it five? there's gonna be a review of the exam and it will be in, this room? i'll send out email, what  okay, and uh, Dennis has homeworks to return to people, but thanks. homework seven, right here. 	1

en_1.mp4.json	Je in feite naar een echte Engelse conversatie met mij en mijn vriendin. We gaan praten over education today us us your top education questions in engels en we're going to have a chitch over deze vragen in Mercio in het Engels en ik hoop dat je dat aan de andere kant van deze conversatie met een hoger level of calorie meer convidence over speaking in het Engels en je wilt genieten lang de weg. En zoals ik altijd heb gekregen heb, heb ik een Adrie PDA4-sheet, wat is over dan space een moment met al up-to-date is important vocabulaire, definitions, simple senatoren, alles wat je hier gaat in de klas en je in de Free PDA4-sheet, zodat je op de link kunt klikken in de beschrijving te downloaden naar de Free PDA4-sheet vandaag. Oké, dan ben je klaar om het te beginnen met de eerste vraag. Waar studenten zijn geweest? Ik ben klaar om de educatie te maken. Oké, laten we het doen. Deze educatie vragen waar ze bij mijn student Harmon van Middle and Mij in Australië. Are you ready for the first? I'm ready for the first question is 1 age the school start in de VS, dat is waar we vandaan zijn. En wat doet de Education helemaal kwijt? Dus luister met een eerste vraag, wat de school start in de VS? Ja, dus veel kinderen gaan naar een school rond vier jaar geleden, dus dit zou pre-school zijn en veel casus dit is niet door de stank te betalen? Ja, dit is iets waar ouders moeten betalen voor uit de bank. En ik zou zeggen dat dit kan ik hier accepteren, misschien een beetje meer educatie per persoon. Dus ze zijn echt een kleine kinderen. En dan officiele school is kinderarts, die start rond vijf of zes jaar geleden. En dit is waar echte school begon, om te studeren en proberen onze letters in alfabet te leren. Ja, lezen en hier zijn nummers en al dat soort dingen. Ja, en dan elementaire school zou eerst fitgrave? Ja, first for fitgrave, which is probably what's zeven to elf or twaalf? Ja, Ja, santé. Ik ben al benieuwd naar mijn zoon. Ja, en dan move ik naar Middelschool, dat is iedereen zijn favoriete tijd van twaalf tot veertien. Het is een soort voorbeeld van sarcasme. Het is een soort sarcasme. Het is een hele coole, niet bekend om de meest leuke tijd te zijn en het is funny, want veel kinderen als moving hebben. Ze kunnen naar verschillende school, verschillende klassen gaan. En dan ga je naar de sacrifice time in je leven. Hier is een andere nieuwe mensen voor je. Dat is een interessante tijd. Meestal, zoals de sterkste type zijn, moet je eraf. Voor die tricky en dan na de middelbare school is high school en bij dat plan jaar wat als voor tien jaar zal je real man like voor tien door achttien jaar zal het zo you're not right the beginning the cast of puberteit in statio ladder en maybe a little more make sure you may night create is still crazy koeien. De nachtgrades is top. Want als je in nachtgrades, en je als veertien of vijftien, en dan zie je zeventien of achttien euro, lot of the especially for a guy like me puberteit can hit all the sentence and then you be a man versus mij guy was a boy al een jongen als je het leuk vond ja dus dit is de typische progressie van school en er zijn een paar verschillende opties in de VS je gaat naar public school, dat is gratis, het is voor je taxus, dus als je taxus hebt Nicole not free. Free not free. Ja, free not free. It's pay for bij the states. We go to public school, you go to a public harder school dus dit is een kind of een nuance waar je niet hoeft te pay extra te gaan naar een harder school maar het is wat hoe. Het is rond privacy. Het is kleiner, meestal de programma's hebben een hoger kwaliteit en om in het charter school vaak te doen moet je een lotter doen en dit is niet zo dat je wanneer een miljoen dollar, dit is waar je net op hebt en ze spoelen een kind uit het hoofd, totaal random en als je het hebt en als je het hebt en als je het niet hebt, Dus het is niet gebaseerd op je inkomen, het is niet gebaseerd op waar je leeft, want de meeste problemen zijn gebaseerd op waar je moet je naar de school in je buurt gaan. Door een geschiedenis? Ja, vooral in een gebied dat echt je school is waarschijnlijk niet een heel hoge kwaliteit. Er is ook wel een controversieel over techniek, want het is een soort sector. Ja, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, het is een stad, party and all that so we've got public school charter school private school I below statistics here I like that and the best fancy private school negen procent van studenten go to a private school en ouders have to pay extra voor private school ik kan een religieus private school, ik kan een secundaire private school, zijn kind, video. Het is een probleem in de één procent, want ik ga naar de natuur. Het is nu wat er in de space is. Het is een heel eindurial private school maar er is ook andere types of private school, zoals een natuurlijke school, waar half de dag ze spend time outside in the wind of de leraar probeert incorporate binnen een outside nature in te beslissen. Veel keren deze scholen noemen zichzelf alternatieven het idee so that's means we're we're try to do something different here ja ja en er is a very difficult of quality just because you're paying for it het niet betekent dat het vastloopt beter wordt dan de vrij public school. Dus als je naar de VS komt en je denkt: ik wil dat beste Education. I think I can not forget to pay for private school, make sure you check it out first and make sure that it's actually the quality that you want. There are always color chips is dus de school die naar San Francisco gaat. Veel mensen hebben een tachtig procent scorechip om naar de school te gaan, dat maakt het heel erg comfortabel. De staat heeft kleurenchips. De school geeft wat kleurenchips. Er zijn wat graphics in de school om kleurenchips te verbeteren, dus ze proberen het meer extra Ja, maar de meeste scholen, vooral private scholen en alles wat educatie gerelateerd is. Je kunt vinden dat veel organisaties die proberen te helpen. Kinderen kijken naar wat ze echt willen. En de overheid helpt dat dus wel? Ja, Amerika. Ik denk wel dat ik bij de ouders kom staan. Hebben in de mogelijkheid om te signed up follow through with the applications sign up for this colourship het is een mini t zien bij is een optie. Er is een vierde optie dat is wat Dennis heeft ervaren toen hij een kind was. Kijk naar mij dus interessant genoeg wat procent van Amerika's denk ik 'Home school'. Dit betekent dat Channely, Dokke, je mam, of waar ik in huis leerde. Je mam, of je dad is een leraar. Jullie zijn je mam. En er is like local organisations that you can join weekly like a co-up they houden home schooling co-up wat procent of american kinderen zijn homoseksuelen, zoals tweeduizend eenentwintig. Ik zou zeggen dat het heel leuk was. Dus ja, ik denk dat ik op je telefoon kijk. En ik zal het voor jou laten zien. Oké, ik wil het zeggen als twee procent. Oké. De voorstelling. Oké. En dat ding is hoger. Ja, de antwoord is zeven procent. Wat is vrij hoog? Het is bijna hetzelfde. Als het gaat om private Ja, dat is crazy. Ja, zo'n zeven procent. En het interessante is dat het een beetje is. Ja, dat is het grote ding. Dus voor covid was ik denk vier of vijf procent en nu is het zeven procent en het groeien tien procent elk jaar zo Dit is hard. Het gaat over de status. Het gaat over de status. Het gaat over het algemeen om alle veranderingen in de en private public school is giving can of like a bad reputatie as well and me there's very quality is but a lot of people where they live there school is not heel goed. En het is niet alleen de leraar, het is ook de heerser met een cannot know. Ik bedoel, ik heb een alternatieve school, dus ik Ik ben geen groot fan van het traditional model en ik hou niet van alle be records en niet om te zeggen dat er nu veel goede, harde mensen in de ik denk dat het systeem is. Ja, het lijkt wel een beetje cliché, maar het is gebroken. Ja, dus dit zijn de generale opties in de VS en ik ging is dat if you use an alternative optie private school charter school home school in het is niet gezien als zeer weird. Het is een musical, het is niet een beetje orgy, maar je hebt niet zoals een oude kast, je hebt niet zo weer mijn kan je je home school, het is niet zo gek, het is gewoon oké, iemand doet iets anders. Ik denk dat het in de dat is een heel Amerikaanse cultuur. Ja, je probeert mensen te accepteren die andere dingen doen. En omdat we in Zuid-Korea leven, vonden we dat verschil is zo groot. We hebben nooit een iemand die op school schoot, daar hebben we net als één familie. Wauw, dit is verbazingwekkend. Iedereen is samen Education systeem en dvd van die norm is echt ongebruikelijk en ja of in lockdown dan in Amerika als je think different like that people they may like some times going like with birthday or like ze had een really graduated apple del never tel je het uur fase? Ja, ze hebben een probleem met dat is zoals een beslissing die je mij maakt, vooral in een persoonlijke situatie. Tien met Home School, en tot hoe oud Yes, tot dertien. Ik denk, ja, het zit zo middels kool. En dat is voor die kool. Ja, en ik voelde dat ik honderd schooltijd vandaag is. Het is een manier beter dan ik was als een kind. Hoe meer resources? Ik denk dat als ik ervaring heb, ik niet één van mijn kinderen. Maar today I can kind of visible see how you can you know built up certain social exposure and certain groups Ja. Er zijn een aantal verschillende soorten online. Ja. En je moeder deed het beste. Mijn moeder deed een goede job. Ik denk dat het gewoon voor mij persoonlijk. Ik denk dat het fit is waar ik het waarschijnlijk nodig heb met een kind. Wat ik vaak heb. Niet het meer Ik heb een deadline nodig. Ik heb een ander nodig dan mijn man. En ik spetter like een grotere social cirkel. En een beetje meer structuur en educatie. Ik denk hoe het goed is voor mij. Niet in mijn mom was een structuur, maar dit is gewoon een andere kant. Ja, homoseksuelen in de 90s, kamperen nu, dertig jaar later, dat is geweldig. Let's go 1 question nummer twee de meeste amerikaanse studenten go to universities after their graduation is het consider the important Wat vraagt je over als onze generatie voelt eerst en dan krijg ik wat stappen. Ja, hoe veel mensen actie zijn? Ik denk dat de dat? Oké, dat is tijd. Ik heb het niet meegemaakt. Laten we je wat in je hart zitten? Nee, ik denk dat mensen we zouden zeggen college? Ik denk dat veel van de wereld een universiteit is. Ik weet niet of de persoon is, maar ik zou zeggen, Wat je gas? Wat je gas is een getal? Ja, zeventien komma vijf procent. Wauw, really! Oké. Wat is het? -Oké. Negentig procent, tweeënzestig procent, één procent. I think this is showing your your bias because the people who know which way the bias 1 said that Dus voor ons hebben we een vier jaar degree en dat is wat je kunt noemen. Als je een college voor vier jaar, kun je twee jaar degree hebben. Het is een Associate degree. Of voor je doelgroep en we hebben voor je degrees en ik denk dus vind ik een studie is de show like if you have a voor je degree meeste van de mensen in je sociale cirkel hebben ook dezelfde, we zijn dicht bij hetzelfde gevoel van educatie. Iedereen weet dat je me kan doen. Dat waarom je denkt het zo hoog als je het daar over bent oké zo in was ik hem hier negentien honderd negentig te negentien er tot tweeduizend eenentwintig Oké. In negentien honderd negentig, de mensen die high school hadden, waren zeventig procent. Dus zeventig procent van studenten hadden een high school, en twintig procent of people graduated from college oké 20 20 why negenhonderd procent van de mensen graduated from high school zoveel hogere procent en dertien procent van de mensen graduated ja Dus het is hoog, het is een top-up. En alle kerken die ik zag, waren allemaal op zoek. Dus finishing highschool en college zijn zeker on the rise. Niet zeventig procent, maar waarschijnlijk is zeventig procent van de mensen Wino. Ik denk dat het niet zo interessant is en dat is een deel van de psychologie en ik denk dat als je geen iemand kent, het zal waarschijnlijk een prioriteit zijn voor jou en het zal harder via de gok, want hij zal mensen die weten hoe dat proces werkt en al dat, maar als je binnen de college bent, zoals ons, het zal gemakkelijker zijn voor onze kinderen om dat proces te doen, want we Ik ben blij dat ik instructie kon worden van de jaloezie. Je weet niet of mijn persoonlijke ervaring is, maar bedankt voor mensen om de jaloezie te zijn voor de miljoenen mensen te maar dit is ook een deel van de vraag, is het belangrijk? Wel nog een this probleem goes to your social cirkel ik was in mijn social cirkel het was super belangrijk en de ik denk dat is waarschijnlijk familie bij familie het allemaal verwacht dat als je je ouders op het college graduates, dat is allemaal het aspect van Crucial Good College. However, ik heb gehoord van zijn, als onze naam. Ik denk dat ze eerst was om naar het college te gaan. En het was leuk, het was geweldig, maar het was niet verwacht. En als een samenleving, het is zeker zeker ingewikkeld. Er is de TV en YouTube. En elke leraar wil zeggen dat je de call-in-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the--the-the--the- meer mensen. Het gaat in het universum, het gaat een grote benefit in je leven en al dit soort dingen. Ik denk dat dit absoluut absoluut in de samenleving, dat is waarschijnlijk nog een reden waarom ik denk dat veel mensen gaan, maar ik ga ook over hoe expensive is. Ja, dat is de andere ding. Is dat heel erg opleidingsniveau? Ik zou zeggen dat er een nieuwe tussen 30000 tweehonderd thousand for your degree te pendelen if you go to a community college or if you go to a states school or you go to op school, ik kan er niet meer naar en dat is een grote persoon voor een young persoon beginnen af in hun carrière te hebben, te hebben, te dat is wel een soort cheap of vriend. DNA cheap en daarna free. Daar cheap je dan de ibiskachels? Ja. Het is een heel complicated systeem, maar het kan een beetje negeren in deze wereld, want ik heb geen tijd over een collega in de wereld, maar We wilden naar een kleine private school en dat is bekend om te zijn als het ware expensive. Ja, maar voor mij had ik veel schildertips om dat is cool dus ik hou van de kleuren chips, de school had ook de hoofdkleuren chips en het was vrij veel ruimer als ik ga naar de school. Ik had een vrouw of geld al die tijd voor, andere woorden, het was gewoon te exponentieel, maar het is interessant omdat we onze ervaring dachten we dat ik voor u kan spreken, we vonden het behoorlijk per dag, zelfs als we onze winkels hebben, we vonden het behoorlijk per dag post-to-date. Te betalen. Als je start af je leven, je hele leven in bed, dat is zo hard. Mijn ouders proberen zo hard, ze hadden veel geld, ik had veel escotips en ik had nog steeds een collage die ik had te betalen, dus zelfs I think I was probably starting out in the best mogelijke position. It's still felt like a birthday, so I think for us, at least for our children. I have no idea what the education team will look like in the other vijftien years but I think that we may have a different perspective on college because we've been there we know what it's like we know if it helpt dus of niet in ons leven en hoe ik denk about this and if it works like other other alternates ja in onze verandering in de wereld. Don't make people better. I don't know. I think it's a cliché man people are age that collega's not worked. Ja. En dat is gewoon een manier om te overtuigen voor wat je gaat redden en het is niet echt voorbereid en al die dingen. Ik denk dat als je het leuk vond, tweeduizend vijf, tweeduizend tien, tweeduizend vijftien, tweeduizend vijftien in dat range. Je probably feel like a step your degree dus niet mean you will get a good paint job it's not Ik geef het niet, dat dat zal gebeuren. Ik denk dat wanneer we twee collega's willen komen, transitional phase waar everything was getting it was getting alarm or expensive en de dead casting benefit analysis was maybe making lessons met al veel van onze families wordt still say in the same message die je just have to go even if you're not sure what you want to do which was in mijn case what they think they help me ja wat het mijn job is het niet gemist wanneer ik een college ja dit Ik weet niet precies wat de toekomst, maar ik weet niet wat de toekomst de wereld is echt, echt fast en dat wil ik niet vertellen dat mijn kinderen de hele collega's moet vertellen en dat als dit wel make all the difference ability like what exactly you want to do was giving mij program was look at the cast benefit en alles is een hammetje kaas en zoals echt in there. Helaas voel ik niet echt mijn ouders de tijd. Maar er was echt een de laatste generatie, die zei: 'Ik ga het university degree.' En dat geeft me een goede job en het werkt. Dus hun expectation was wat er gebeurde, maar dat is hoe het nu is. Iedereen weet wie er in de volgende tien, de vijftien jaar voor Arkins, maar ik wil ze niet presteren. En ik wil veel discipline hebben als ze niet te gaan naar college. Zolang ze in dependent van een kind om iets anders te doen. Ik ga de transitie naar de laatste vraag en skip één vraag. Ik ben echt want ik denk dat je er iets over hebt. Nou, ik ben een gas. Want het heeft te doen met wat er gebeurt als je een college is het moeilijk te vinden als je niet hebt universiteit degree. Ik deel een onderzoek over dit, maar wat je gaat zeggen, als je geen universum doet, dan is het harder om het te krijgen. Ja, ja, als je het niet hebt, dan heb je het niet gedaan. Ik moet je voorstellen dat het moeilijk is. Ik denk dat het niet moet zijn, maar ik denk dat ik weet niet of hij van eigenlijk red like een studie dat is maar ik denk dat hij hoorde een podcast dat dat is like someting that employers will look at and like the bill card check up for the for you the green light failies can have a summer that that means a lot Dus ik denk dat het doet, dat betekent iets. Onfortunately, I don't think you can probably echt gek well educated with now it's not a days and I think that might be preferable when you think about your casts so ik ben like this life social experiences over all other social experience is er like getting really trunk in de misbehaving in Ja, dat is echt iets te doen. Het is een Amerikaanse call. Het is gewoon daar. Kaddronken. Slapen met veel mensen. En dan misschien je stamboom in de klas. Ja, dat maakt niet echt iets. En dan heb je wat geld voor dat. Dat was een psychologie ervaring, maar dat is er een leraar. O, hij was daar. Wat gebeurt er voor andere mensen? Ja, maar ik wil nog steeds zeggen dat het een originele probleem is. Ja, ik zou zeggen dat dat waarschijnlijk voor specifieke coureurs. Dus wat ik zag is als iemand natuurlijk als je een dokter zou kunnen zijn, als je een engineer zou zijn. Mooi, ja. Als je in de medical field doet heel specifiek techniek type jobs dat require education that education is probably necessary maar voor andere coureurs wat ik red on mine zei is ik al is de green as a siri yes and no de jas was als je in de specifieke kampeervelden wilt zijn, ja, als je naar binnen gaat, ga naar de en you be finally think it's actually even at twee years degree. That's amazing. That's the most preferable, because some kind of 2 years program I feel like you can learn misschien niet alles, maar veel dingen sinds twee jaar, maar het moet niet voor je zijn. Maar als je een job wilt dat je een doelgroep, of ze hebben een doelgroep in hun applicatie, misschien als software engineer, of iets zoals ik dus, als je in een soort persoon bent, die heeft een veel alternatieve ervaring gehad. Dit geeft een specifieke persoonlijke type, denk ik. Ja, dat is iets voor dat resonement. Ja, you have a good resumé you intern you have maybe taking some extra curriculaire classes at the local collatier misschien zelfs online courses about specific feeling. Dat is een hectisch. Een alternatief. Ja, de EU kan bij your assertiefness which is really wat people looking for a final people who will see a problem and fix the problem de skills can really be thought maar dat persoonlijke karakter quality kan niet meer zijn. Dus als je dat laat zien, dan kun je het zo dit is een about a job, dit is about getting in the collage. Er was een home school, hoe had een home school hun hele leven? And they want it to get into a few university and think it was harvard but it was like a really high level university en wat they didn't stay they were out of course every chair die they were with everyone here experienced all the best maar ze ook een lijst de second page of hun applicatie was honderd box dat ik red last year holy calls I twee box a week Ze rijden overal aan en in orde in al dit en het laat zien hun assertiviteit, ik ga een goede student zijn, ik ga het en ik denk voor veel jobs, if you can be outstanding mij god, then you could also have a degree ideal, a little example to is iemand die werkt voor mij lora hi lora if you watching she help surrounds some of the sales content, ik sales e-mails, she's a copy redder. Als I interviewd haar, I don't know if she has a colleague. Nog even know haar official education but haar application proces haar experience energie had om het initiatief te doen om wat online copywriting klassen te doen en had gewerkt in on en af for some other businesses doing there righting as well so she had this kind of initiative and that's really what I was looking for with someone us organize toch de initiatief creative en was interessant in de job. De heer Take You take in some klassen of her own tradition and Willy Donnes in that's why I en ze zijn geweldig. Eigenlijk veel van mijn studenten die in mijn cursus genieten. Ze zeiden dat hun baan niet meer waren om Engels te nemen. Maar zij rijden onder resumé compleet drie maanden inglish course with speaking bush with vanessa het is niet een vier uur degree, het is niet in IL certificaat, iets officieel zoals dat, maar shows dat je het initiatief hebt? Ik denk dat het heel eenvoudig is en het is zo dat je je wilt gaan extra mile en om je best Dus ik denk dat dat een goed voorbeeld is. Extra curriculaire educatie kan in je carrière wat vragen over internship's? Ik ben nieuwsgierig in je land, is het een comment om een internship te doen. Ik denk dat in Duitsland misschien you do a year internship after high school. That is like part of this system. I'm not sure if you from Germany you have now. That sound like a better system for me. The e-commerce de hele wereld ervaring in de wereld. Ja. Doe in iets, maar ik vind dat voor mij echt heel hoog voelt. You can get out of the education system. I thought very overwon't going from high school to 4 years of college and then I had part time jobs working in restaurants in this type of things but nothing like a career and mijn derde jaar college. Ik dacht: ik wil gewoon naar de wereld gaan en probeer het een job te krijgen. Ik doe Ja, wat doe ik? En het komt niet in de VS om een grapje te nemen. Dit is een comment, denk ik in Europa en Australië. De After High School, studenten will take a gap year and go out and do something. Could you be anyone? Could you be anyone? Could you be anyone? Could you be anyone? Could you be anyone? Could you be anyone? Could you Ja, ik denk dat als je in dit station reist, doe iets. Als we in Friends Day één year, deden we iets anders. Zien de ieder be taking a cap year or do anything can of interesting ja ik weet ik like dat always in the us het kan het strange dat je graduay high school en je hebt de big ceremonie en can graduation to get to move on to more school ja ik preme wat je care into the als je in de VS werd en hij werd van een high school en je zei: Ik ga een paar keer nemen en dan al besloten wat ik wil doen. Elke single persoon wil zeggen, als je niet naar het college bent, je gaat het nooit doen. Het is je kans om het nu te doen, want ik ga het nu over je, heb je de motivatie om te doen, je vergeet over educatieve en vergeet over maf, dit soort dingen, maar in realiteit, als je niet moet gaan naar de collega's en je weet het jaar en je moet niet naar de collega's willen maken, dat was een betere vraag. Ik weet niet of ik de rabbijnen voelde, want Ik zag dat mensen dat doen in dat Europeans, dat doen we in dat Gapyr en ik vond het echt leuk om te doen. Ik zou het leuk vinden. Let's maar dit is nou in american cultuur maybe you might start becoming part of it as we can learn more about europe or like 10 years bij idea in the things maar reina is niet een deel van een Amerikaanse cultuur. Het doet je school, mogelijk meer school en meer stap school. Neem terug je school met je job. Dus dat is het. All right. Bedankt voor het praten over Education. Welkom. Ik appreciate. Dank je wel voor je graag vragen? Laat het weten in de comments als je een internship of een rapper wilt komen in je land. Ik wil veel meer leren over dat en vergeet niet om de gratis PEA4-sheet te downloaden, wat al een geweldig boek heb je al gezien dat je op het scherm hier staat dat we gebruiken, je kunt naar voor cabillary definition simple sense is in het bottom of that free work sheets you can enter benessed challenge questions zodat je nooit vergeet wat je leert je klikt op de link in de beschrijving en download die gratis PDAF voor Xi vandaag. Wat denk je zo veel te fijn voor jullie vandaag om te praten over de educatieve te praten? Fijn. Ik hoop dat je een beetje smart bent. Ja! En dank je veel voor het leren in Engels met mij. Ik zie je weer een volgende vrijdag voor een nieuwe les hier op mijn YouTube-kanaal. Bye. Maar wacht, doe je meer dan deze video leuk? Waar je zult zien en andere echte Engelse conversatie tussen Dhanno about parentine, our 1 2 drie kinderen en ik kan je me voorstellen in Engels meer en dan zie je daar.	0

en_4.mp4.json	Good morning in deature. Ik ben hier. Je vertelde me dat je me wilde praten. Morning Nelson? Ja, ik vertelde je hier te komen, omdat je zei dat je mijn hulp wilt hebben. Ja, ik wil gewoon mijn Engels proeven en ik wil jou wat tips geven om het De studenten vragen meestal met die vraag. Ze zeggen altijd: Ik kan een Engels wel spreken. Of hoe kan ik mijn Engels gebruiken om een band Engels te spreken? Of laat een naam van de speaker Dat is waarom ik deze video moest maken met de meest belangrijke tips. Te helpen om je Engels te helpen. Dus, ik wil aandacht nemen en nadenken als mogelijk. Maar het is meer belangrijk om te werken. Natuurlijk waardeer ik je hulp. Stel me hoe kan ik mijn Engels maken? Meer dan tips Ik zal je iets vertellen wat je kunt doen om je Engels te verbeteren. De meest belangrijke praktijk is elke dag. Designe hoeveel tijd per week je de studie en als ik doe het Ik ken dat sommige mensen zeggen: 'Praktisch', elke dag is niet iets goed. Want je krijgt stress of boosheid, maar dat is niet waar. Als je in Spreuken, je Engels wilt praten. Je moet het maken van het maken van het maken van het maken van dat is waar, maar comfortabel. Je moet realistisch zijn over je tijd. Niet jezelf niet werkt als je kan. De sleutel is om te weten hoe je je Him, dertig minuten, één uur, elke dag zal een naam zijn. Ik geef je een voorbeeld Ik had de student het laatste jaar. Één van hen had een grote Engels. Laten we het Maar de andere wil graag Engels spreken, omdat hij naar de VS moest reizen, dit jaar De eerste één practice, Engels, drie keer een week. En dat was oké, alert, alert, En de andere, praktisch Engels, elke dag, van Maanday to Friday, drie uur per dag. En in een weekend heeft hij een andere activiteit om Engels te brengen. Je leert Engelse zoon. Maar hij had de SERA-Side tijd om zijn Engels te maken. Hij besloot het minder te werken en te studeren. Omdat hij een objectieve had. Wat ik bedoel, is dat je een Engels pastor kunt leren, maar ze zullen afhankelijk zijn van jou. Zelfs zo, niet geloven die mensen die je in het Engels kunt leren, in slechts een paar maanden. Dat is niet waar. Zelfs als je start-ie zes uur per dag, leer je een nieuwe taal is een proces. Het zal ook afhankelijk zijn op het niveau dat je Als je al de basis van de taal hebt, dan zal het sneller zijn. Maar als je Basic-English hebt of je is het moeilijk om te leren. Dan zal ik u meer dan juiste munten nemen. Een andere vraag, praktisch de of vaardigheden, lezen, schrijven, spreken, spreken en luisteren. Ze zullen je altijd helpen om je te verbeteren in verschillende manieren. Ja, ik ken deze tips en Maar ik heb gehoord dat sommige studenten zeggen dat ze alleen een groot Engels willen schrijven of lezen. En dat is geen essentie. Je moet dit al deze vaardigheden maken. Als je echt wilt leren en language Je kunt gewoon leren om Engels te leren. Je moet lezen, schrijven, schrijven en luisteren. Absoluut, je kunt meer in één schaal pakken. Ze willen meer maar alle van hen belangrijk zijn. Emotion, je bent adonye interviewer en Je zegt tegen de winter 'B' of 'Je kunt de band Engels spreken. En hij vroeg je af om je trainen en onwetendheid in een stuk papier. Wat zal je doen? Een ander ding. Als je een nieuw woord vindt, is, denk over hoe je het in essentie kunt gebruiken. En probeer het te gebruiken in een conversatie. Asuna is mogelijk. Je hoeft het niet te gebruiken. Neem gewoon geen nood van de woorden en leef het het geen echte centrum is of conversatie. Bijvoorbeeld, als je alleen het woord 'bad' hebt, dan gebruik je het in je echte leven ervaring. Ik ben bang, maar ik ben Ik zal nooit bed, ik beloof me. Ik zal Engels leren, ik ben bed. Maar altijd maakt het deel van je leven. Vergeet niet om dat te zien in een andere kant, examen of boek. Nog een. Als je geïnteresseerd bent in het leren van het spelletje verbonden bent, zoals Engels spreken in Show. Één die je leuk vindt en de subtitles op een of een paar minuten of die bemined worden. Palkia is intens, op het verschil tussen de princeration, en de juiste vorm. Ik moest dat doen als ik in het leren En geloof me, het helpt een lot en het is echt waar. Wat ook? Nee, je Als je geen morning persoon niet begint in de morning. Je zult mensen horen dat de morning de morning de beste tijd van de dag om Engels te leren. Want je hebt een eigen mind en tools kind van dingen. En dat is niet waar. Niet alle mensen hebben dezelfde routine. En 'Way of learning' staan mensen haten 'Waying up' early. Like 'Mijn vrouw' Ze kan niet beginnen in de ochtend, omdat de shitwheelsjes gelukkig zijn op dat moment. Maar dat is gewoon moeilijk in het evenwicht. In feite leren ze meer dingen op nacht dan tijdens de dag. Dat is waarom ik je vertelde, weet je, maar dat is iets belangrijks. Wat ook? Maak gebruik van communicatie en die tijd om te zien wat je hebt leren. Ik heb gehoord dat sommige mensen zeggen dat ze geen tijd hebben om Engels te leren. Dat is geen enkel gevoel. Je moet niet op een boek zitten om Engels te brengen. Technologie veranderen beter. Nu kun je naar een podcast luisteren. Terwijl je op de bus gaat werken, of waarom je op de bus gaat werken? Of wanneer je een sjouwer neemt, kun je jezelf respecteren. Vraag en antwoord vragen. Er is altijd een manier om je Engels te doen. Als je het echt wilt doen, zal stoppen, maken excuses. En een wat meer belangrijke dingen. Geef jezelf een lange termijn goal. Of bijvoorbeeld, neem een test of reizen naar hun land. Je vindt dat je harder werkt als je iets moet starten. Sterk. Zoals het voorbeeld dat ik je geef over de man, We moeten Engels leren om het volgende jaar te leren. Als je een lange, lange golf hebt, en belangrijk is: dit zal je moeilijker werken. En ik zou je meer tips geven om je Engels te geven, maar het zal in een volgende video zijn. Yes, please theacher, ik moet meer weten over hoe ik mijn Engels What are you guys?

en_5.mp4.json	Hai, Christa. -Hai, Kiki Janten. -Meest wie je oké? Christa, kom je onder de bewaar jezelf? -Hai, een educatieve programme at Lycarac College en werken aan een transitie van een internal hoger om een de Jackson-tal gebied community. Waarom? Waarom de move? Mijn wipe-job is 'Looping Dansaf' en ik kom lang met het is heel nobel en als mijn robot bij jullie het teamtijd en hoe ga je hier over de professional over wat onze bedrijf hier is. Wat heb ik over de ambitie van de verandering en bewegen van een fysieke locatie that I thought about making a crew move as 1. And I was starting with mij main interest and passions. And I love doen hoe door activiteiten en ik hou van werken met mensen en ik dacht dat ik mijn ervaring kan gebruiken als een leraar helpen mensen en mijn interessante je ouders samen. Dat zou een goede plek zijn om een nieuwe carrière te maken. En als ik online bezoek, heb ik een RAI-website gevonden. En de positions een belangrijk gebied, dus ik dacht dat ik een probleem zou zijn. Oké. Nou, je zei dat je een interessant hebt door activities, dus dit zou een groot bedrijf zijn voor je om te werken, dat betekent: wat is Gino van ons bedrijf? Ik weet niet of ik een lange tijd ben sinds negentien honderd dertig en wat echt mijn aandacht het meest was het idee dat het begon met mensen die een passie hadden voor de ouders en met anderen in hun ervaring. I like the idea too, your company is consistable, right, right? That's how 1 other te werk voor bij Fortuna Magazine. En ik begon met een company. Dat heeft dat labiele succesgroep een goede prijs te zijn. Waarom wilde ik dit specifieke positie hier, waar ik met onze customer service apart ben. Omdat ik wil te starten in positie me to learn everything about the company from the very basic level of interaction with the customer's all the way up to the sales proces, de marketingproces en de productie van goederen en services. Onze Assalya customer service, ik vond de lijn heel goed met de skillset die ik heb en ook met wat skills die ik heb gebruikt, dat ik het kan je niet altijd een more body skills de you train surfen from your previous line of work to artificial and education is het allemaal om een customer of student veel comfortabeler te helpen en te helpen met hun growth. Ik voel dat met een company zoals REA. Het is dezelfde relatie. Een customer comfortabel met het product en helpen ze hun grof als ze gewend zijn en wat er gebeurt. Ik denk dat onze company zou ik u specifiek een monsterk pool of kinderen dat ze interviewen voor deze positie. Ik denk dat ik een skillset heb in Balls mijn background Education. Teachers zijn de meest meest stress professionals in het werkplaats. En RAI-cijfers en een mensen helpen om mensen uit te sturen. En leraren hebben ook veel down-time in de somers. Mijn denken is dat veel sneller in de roads en de band in de company and be what's in market the services and products that are a office specifiekly to the leasure professionals Ik heb daar altijd het question. Gavin, you are making a creator change. I think it's special you have to finish in een master's studie in education if a position becomes available in your car veel down in de jackson hole area how do you approach being over this job versus being off the position and you feel in en ik vraag me naar in de knel en in de toekomst. Dat is een goede vraag. Ik ga niet verder operationele apparatuur met internet professional. Ik feel like this customer service opportunity, the change to work in a feel that I enjoy as much as teaching is een plek die ik in Monca kan groeien. Dus wat ik gedaan heb is werken met mensen. En mensen komen een beetje beter dan ze waren wanneer ik ze met hen. En dat is heel snel in I miss you so I don't miss a certain successful career for something already done. I feel like this is a natural conflict, so mij interessant. Chris, wat zou je identificeren als je grootste professionele strength? Ik denk dat patiënten waarschijnlijk mijn grootste strength zijn. Die transformeert een cross, de coureurs, beingable to listen to a student or customer's difficulty and help them overcoming difficulty with patients and compassion is mij greatest strength. Kan je elke week beslissen dat je een ander mentale uitdaging moet zijn. Ik denk dat er een risico is. Wanneer koms to compassion and think people can miss and treffer compassion as been easy or willing to rollo als het belangrijk is om te begrijpen dat compassie iets is dat is erg, het is interactief en ik voel als ik een status queer bandry's met customer client students te ondersteunen dat. Ik begrijp dat ik een beetje en ik ben kind. Maar ik ga ook de hele de people line-up with to a high standard. To date. What you said is your graded professionality mensen persoonlijk becoming a teacher learning master's degree do's about wonderful experience for me but the great het regime wat moet worden met jonge mensen en helpen men een beetje beter en communicating met de wereld ronde. Chris, geniet van me over een challenge of een conflict die je fascineert in de is en hoe je met hen deelt. Zeker. Met hen, de educatieve professional, hun challenges, elke dag. Je deelt met honderd verschillen, verschillende persoonlijkheids en interesses. En dat was een enthousiasme. Dus bijvoorbeeld om medestudenten met content te vinden en te bereiken is een onderdeel van het cognitieve onderzoek. Ik denk dat bepaalde professional relationship's is een andere manier om wat comfort te ondersteunen of mensen te komen from. Privacy te onderwijzen, Ik ben benieuwd hoe het toegankelijk is. Fotografing events zoals When's en Barmethoa's en heel erg belangrijke events en mensen live. En veryone. So we just like to learn our contracts with patients and listening to the client customer's kneeses. Heel belangrijk. Nou, je bent geïnterviewd voor positie, want de hype is niet een echt heel level positie en er is de mogelijkheid om those in our company de were overloopt for this position may have to impressory and recorded the new higher for this position Hoe heb je dit potentiële uitdaging voor de werkplaats? Het belangrijkste is om te luisteren naar de mensen om mee te luisteren naar de en een nieuwe kamer. En ze weten meer over de werken in de omgeving dan ik zal komen. Ik denk omdat ik een familie de minnaar heb en niet conversational wat meer mensen die in time willen hebben kans te kunnen charlie's ritueel respect en ik denk dat we wat dezelfde ding de company de group en ons te groeien met ons bedrijf. Word je zeer jezelf in vijf jaar specifiek bezig bent met ons bedrijf? Hopelijk de markt die me te interacteren met mensen met een teaching professional. En in onze branding gebruiken we de markt als een target client base. Dat is geweldig. Je geïnterviewd met elk andere bedrijf en als zo wat je interessant vindt over die specifieke bedrijf. Sinds een nieuw gebied, heb ik een hybride hybride met een wit bedrijf een bedrijf Ik heb dat fast-programma's geboekt en ik heb het in mijn interview gedaan. Ze hebben een similar missie en een similar golf naar RAI. Het is gewoon dat product line is meer specifiek betaalbaar dan Ariya's, of ooit onze offerings. We hier Ariya je weet het is vegan customer service there are aspecten of your job there are going to be a little more active than I can expect you be en en een teaching position waar je simuleren on your feed more one-in-one face-to-face with individuals. Do you prefer specifieke type work-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in--in-in--in-in-in--in--in--in- het werk in de omgeving. Ik zou verwachten dat we in een kubicle interactief met klanten zijn en dat is een soort van een call. Dat is een onderdeel van het jaar. Maar wat ik zou verwachten is om daadwerkelijk geëngageerd met de klanten die naar de store komen en helpen ze de producten die hun best zijn nodig hebben, mits je in de producten die ze kunnen uitvoeren. Dus wat heb ik verwacht om op te bewegen? En het is een goed systeem dat ik me geëngageerd met een customer of is to improve what we offer to our customer's read. Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have discovered on a decision with made for you and staff verber is I work and how they deal with us. Sure, we fill the education, there are new initiatiefnemers all the time. Sommige dingen die initiatieven geeft, moet je deze manier leren, deze vele keer per week. Iets wat er gebeurt is, ik denk dat het een worden om terug te gaan naar wat je weet over je professionele skillset en we willen research and supports why you wat je doet. En ik denk dat als je met de flexibiliteit opnieuw bent, het is belangrijk om te doen wat de BAS zegt. En het is belangrijk om ook even te geven wat de klant of student. Oké, we gaan even uitzoeken wat Cognitive Behavior questions and basically the questions are designed. They're not not talking about your sticks er een soort out of the box questions and so just do your best to enjoy them and trick with us so ja je een engel? Wat zou jij zijn en waarom? Het is een toffe vraag. Ik denk de sporen van mijn dog. Als ik een dog had, zou ik een dog willen zijn, zou ik een dog willen zijn. Ze hebben hun verantwoordelijkheid nodig om hun verantwoordelijkheid te houden en ze hebben zoveel benefits voor de mensen. Iets wat ik wil doen in mijn leven als een human twee. Oké. De volgende vraag is: hoe als ik niet fit en het wilde me zeggen. Ik wist wat ik de briljante vraag hebben we wat hulp nodig. We moeten weten wat type van de machine is, want we praten over een stretch SUV, dat is veel groter dan dan de missie en we praten naar de voordeur. Ik weet ook niet wat er in dat missie is, ik ben al andere mensen dan daar, of is het ernstig? Want zij had in het Engels heb ik wat rekenmachines over de kant van het tennisspel, hoeveel gebied of hoeveel val je met XITE de binnenzijde van het museum en dan meng je de maagd op zoek. Ik kan dat antwoord geven, ik kan gewoon mijn hoofd doen. Nee? Laat me eerst de laatste vraag over onze dagelijkse vragen voor ons. Ik wens jullie een paar keer over dit een helling grow een mark it for rbi I'm just curious as a new entry or someone starting out on a lower level how open is operations, the ideas of an employee. We do try to have a monthly meetings, where we een vrij idee van een vrouw is een random, dus deze zijn dingen die niet zo schadelijk zijn, het regulier zijn, en er heel sammy in een nieuwe er heel informal. We do like to use our employees opinions about our products, specially and about marketing. Één ding dat we niet doen, is de lagere level gepositioneerd, die tegelijk met collecties of de intake en distribution of customer service call. We don't necessarily talk to dark group of employees. Dan, maar ik ben heel interessant om je mening te horen. Ik ben zo blij dat je voor de positie bent en dat het beter is om te bereiken. Ik van onze ontwikkeling is om verder te gaan. Oké. En dan vraag ik: Wat voor je perspectief is het beste deel over het werken voor RAI? Ik denk dat het emissier with our company is very welkoming and even in mij position in someone ever management doos de I work for their above me, we zijn heel goed hun employees. En ik denk dat het vanwege de problemen van onze employees was. We waren heen employee het is heel gemakkelijk om dingen te doen, want mensen willen hun werk doen. Ik heb voor mijzelf in posities waar ik andere mensen die more turanical in nature. En dat is heel moeilijk om je meer te doen. En ga over het einde waar je in de situaties. Dus ik geloof dat als het nummer één bijna verder werkt in een art-particulaire bedrijf is de MS-wereld zelf. Oké, dank je wel voor je tijd. En match. Zeker.	0

en_2.mp4.json	Hi, ik ben Benessa van speak-english withpenessa punt com. En vandaag ben ik hier met mijn vriendin. En are you ready? Te zijn in een echte Engelse conversatie. Vandaag hebben we het over het onderwerp van Haren team used to be parents and we got into them only is dat dan? Nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee, Dus we gaan ons gewoon abonneren op de Vlieg en geven je wat mogelijkheden om in een Engels conversation. En zoals altijd heb ik een gratis PDA-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier-vier you can download it and get all up today's important vocabulaire frases position en ik in a happened in this class in je kunt het downloaden in een gratis PDF-waarde vel. Er is een link in de beschrijving, zodat je het vandaag kunt downloaden en nooit vergeten. Oké, ik ben al begonnen met de eerste Ik ben klaar. Oké, hier gaat het. Wat kan het zijn? De vragen zijn van Alex van Brussel, Claudia van Brussel en verre van Taiwan. De alle vragen over haar heen en de eerste is: wat? Als het zo is, hebben drie kinderen zo ver? Misschien kunnen we op een achtergrond van onze kinderen eten en al die kinderen doen. We hebben drie en drie. Dus we hebben video die zes is nu klaar is, die is drie en we hebben een nieuwe baby met Hilda die is twee maanden oud wanneer je in Genes. Ja, wat heb ik in drie kids zo vaak? Mijn feel wat we ervaren zo ver is niet waarschijnlijk representatief van wat er zal gebeuren. Ja? Ja, want Mathilde, je weet ze is gewoon een beetje baby en ze is eigenlijk een heel, heel, voor ons, ze nemen haar naam en ze nemen ze niet op en ze nemen ze niet op pad en ze nemen ze niet op pad en ze slepen ze allemaal nacht. Dus dat is ongelofelijk. Ik hoorde dat voor een baby, dus zo ver, het is behoorlijk easy on a with me selden but the other 2 days you know that as they get all their attack they can enberone wake it all harder En ik denk dat het groter is voor problemen is. En ik ben zeker wel heel veranderd als ik een ouder en ik ga naar verschillende stages. Maar echt, ik denk dat het de meest difficult is. Ik denk dat de meest difficult was van nul kinderen. Tot één keer, want het is zo'n heel leven veranderd. We gaan naar de Burri en Trivy en Night, dan ga ik met onze vriend. We gaan een nachtleven. Dan ga ik op lange hoog en dingen doen doen wat misschien spannend. Gaan we naar binnen? Ja, en wanneer we een baby altijd in je leven verandert dramatisch. En die tekening is gewoon in de baby zoals in de straat. Je bent altijd bang. Oké. Dus ik like that with the biggest change in how it most difficult change. I know all other people going from 1 kid to 2 kids is the most difficult ik hoop, want ik heb altijd een eerlijke jungle in twee verschillende mensen. Maar voor ons, alles is voor mij, ik ga in van nul naar één, met de meest difficult één-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee-twee zijn eigen mening over de beste naam. Ik ga van twee tot drie software niet verbinden. Ja, nee, nee. Misschien is het dus omdat ze is pretty chill en ik denk dat deze zomer has been really special because you've been home I've had een andere parents at home at all times to help with all the children so in staat of being parents alone alleen met drie kinderen. Nou, we hebben twee kinderen, een hele tijd, maar wanneer je dat is verandering, want school is terug, dan gaat het weer terug naar de school waar hij werkt, veel ook in de school, vooral in de hogeschool, dus ook in de andere band trackers, dus misschien zullen we je updaten. Dat is het fijne aspect. Ja, ik denk dat het een veel verkeer is voor mij. Ik ben thuis, maar nu ben ik thuis voor de zomer, het is eigenlijk harder voor mij, denk ik overal, want hier is altijd een houding of een haring voor iemand op de tijd. Er is geen probleem met de baby, dus het is gewoon een soort van cycli door de kinderen. Waar ik nu naar toe ga? Ja, we zeggen, als het niet de ander is. Iemand is altijd een probleem met alle tijden. Hopelijk is het niet alle drie en dezelfde keer. Ik denk dat het alleen voor een keer zo ver was, want iedereen was cry. Ja, en we waren allemaal daar, we waren allemaal cry. Nou, daar vond je dus kan kijken of je jezelf kan liefhebben, want het is heel leuk. Wat ga ik doen? Ik weet het niet. Nou, hier gaan we. Ik weet het niet. Ik weet het niet. Ik weet het niet. Ik weet het niet. Picture want er is een it's een facebook hey dit also inside geen pagina's of new york maybe if you have a few of not highly recommend it cases the great way to get little snippets of mind gorgeous culture je weet, dus de guy gaat rond New York, nemen foto's of strangers en hij vroeg ze wat over hun leven en ze vroeg of ze iets heel interessants is. Ik denk er is 1 couple heat a picture of en they had a young child with them and I sent something like or they sent something about the process of the side of the Netherlands, they could have children. No, I know, like we like a life now, we have kids and I think the highest band, hij zei: Wel, hebben kinderen is zoals een vol human ervaring. De mensen hebben hun kinderen en hun eigen kinderen, voor integriteit en zo zie je dat wanneer hun kind is extremely in de bath er hebben lekker crazy time they just look at the other in dat is het enige wat je kunt doen, ja, ik geef frustraties, ik geef Engels, soms tijds, maar in het einde kan het gewoon een stap terug gaan. Oké, dit is Kitty, ik hoop dat het iets We zijn in de volle human ervaring. Het is niet echt dat pad, het is in general. Het is heel mooi en heel merkwaardig. Ja, ik denk dat het iets is om op haar heen is dat on papier. Er is veel negatiefs. Het verandert je leven, het verandert veel. Het verandert veel meer cijfers. Het verandert veel meer cijfers. Het verandert veel meer cijfers. Het verandert veel mechanismes op papier in balfd maar ik denk dat iedereen die is binnen een paard of als je bent in de media en je hoopt dat ik haar af in a year sisters child or a grime other and take care of other children it's intentionable de reward. Ja, dat is een grote hoeveelheid. Dit is allemaal verminderd, we hebben het over ons en we hebben het over het evangelie van deze conversatie. In de pow weeks on the mij youtube channel zo dat miss dat video picture subscribe to the speaking glass with me net een youtube channel zodat you can get mensen hebben een paar weken over de lessen. Oké, laten we naar onze volgende vraag.

Ik heb een vraag, dat is fantastisch. Elk experiment in Korea waren niet meer terug met hun vragen. Ja, wat heb je over wat is competitie voor is waar twee mensen kan winnen. Alleen één persoon kan winnen. Ja, en zo. Viking. En een concreet ding voor de 1 prize. Musical. I think that prize in a family is en zo ja er is alleen twee awesome en soms is het alleen één awesome, dus dat competitie is vaak en ze denken niet dat ik the 1 to get mom's attention de meeste not really consciously thinking but that's just bij nature how it is de limited resource is onze attention zo simpel in sets broeders en zusters competitie en between sabble ins doing do you not know about Ja, vooral in de zin van onze aandacht. Ik denk dat we proberen te geven attention en special 1 on 1 attention hoewel ik nodig sta met freddy of second 1 e definitely crisis voor attention of wat meer hij doet, meer dingen om je te maken. Wat are you doing? Niet wat meer like hey look at me look at me die dat ik dat zo hier hij zal lang more direct het is probably because hij is the second child ja ja ik bedoel je de second child je de middel child you're like you know it's the quiet window Ja? Ja, het is makkelijk om te doen. Ik denk dat het een crime attention is. Dus ik doe een beetje dingen om te proberen met en dus, om te doen of je veel likes attention hebt voor meer kinderen. Is dit nou mijn eigen antwoord nu? -Yes. Maar toch niet het idee? Ja, misschien een beetje een beetje, want ik was het was de I was de Easy Child en mijn broeder was een beetje bang voor de de squeaky wheel is the expression me hier dus de squeaky wheel gets the oil is dat te zeggen die ja. Dus ja, hij was een beetje meer van een uitdaging. Kid, de naam was. Hij was van Mike Herenton. Perspective. Ja, ik ben net zo blij dat deze veel aandacht op hem, want hij was ieder meer difficult. Ze probeerden hem meer difficult. En zo is het niet omdat je het niet kent. Het is gewoon dat je misschien dat ik iedereen niet weet. Het was gewoon leuk. Hij is goed. Hij is goed. Hij is goed. Hij is goed. Hij is goed. Hij is Ik had misschien wat problemen op de weg, want misschien hebben we. Ik denk dat iedereen als veel van hun Ja, maar ik denk dat Freddy veel meer direct is dan hij is prima. Maar ik denk dat dat goed is. Ik wil het weten, hij is prima. Hij is erg enthousiast. Hij is meer jouw zuster. Ik wil dit en ik wil het nu en ik ga nu in de stad een tolk. Ik denk dat ik als we besloten of we er nog niet willen hebben, was dat we een hoop aandacht kunnen geven om aandacht te redden. Want het kan een stereotype dat de middel van kinderen gaat gewassen worden, of als En ik hou van Freddy, I don't want him to be claustrofir, but kind of bij Default, wie speelt hier met alleen iemand die je niet kent. En dan heb ik een baby, dus ik moet tijd hebben met haar en dus wat er gebeurt in de Middeleeuwen, ik heb het bij Default, ze krijgen een beetje minder een hemdje. Hun hele leven dus ik wilde zorgen dat dat was iets dat ik in de ochtend kan zijn, ja, ik weet niet of ik hem mijn attention, maar ik denk dat hij al staat voor hemzelf. Hij heeft een sterk persoon, nee, nee, nee, nee, nee. Maar welke competitie met elkaar? Dat is how I would definitely take it like siding with each other maybe you like I mean I have know this that very who said I can do this the best ja en theo be like no I can do it better zodat je kan een heleboel arguments ik we try not to compare them with each other in front of them like some times when we're talking with just each other when the kids are sleepy might say like ik denk dat het heel belangrijk is om dit te doen, maar ik denk dat het heel belangrijk is om te laten zeggen video dat is dus freddy je youtube twee of freddy video dus ik doe dat look at hem ipad kind of comparison Het is beter om te kopen, ik denk meer gendervorming. Don't head. In staat: Theo does not head usion head too. I don't head. Als een rol versus als ik een comparison. Ook ik zou het heel erg aanraden als je meerdere kinderen hebt, of als je een grandpa hebt, dan heb je meerdere grenzen er is een boek 'Sitling' maar ja, er is een boek Sitling. Older version it's hp peacefal parent hp seppelin zijn druk met me te denken daar People carey happy, subly impressive it right here, and then space. This will give us an amazing over hoe ze helpen hun bless competition between sabrains and just have your kids get a 1 dus I think when I see you with your sabrains as a dots I guys get a long really well. But it's so nice that it's Christmas. When ever we're getting together. Ja, I some people drag going like family gallery's because they just fight with their sip lines maar they just have a very relationship and I feel like you guys game to join charlie. Mijn broeder komt weer bij. Ja, maar ik denk dat het brood is. Ja, ik denk kun je naar wat het zou kunnen zijn van mijn vriendin naar de website. Ik denk dat je what I would wait mij kind. We melt down with age too. There was never fakenes in me and mij brother's life with a pretty intention. Ja, wat doe je nog steeds? We vinden een hoop school. Een hoop school? Ja. Een hoop school? Een hoop school. Is dat hoe heet je die kinderen? Ja. Ik denk dat dat wel enorm is. Ja, ik denk dat het wel enorm is. Ik denk dat het wel enorm is. Ik denk dat het wel enorm is. Ja, ik bedoel, ze zijn vrij blij om je soms te doen, maar niet na te wachten. Ik denk video is eigenlijk redelijk goed uit. Ik merk dat de andere brother in altijd zo serieus over de competitie. Ja? En dan zal het nog wel even goed herkennen. Wat een dag als ik groter als je een petritis hebt, dus ze hebben al een beetje een precognition. Ja, met de andere dag, toen Theo was een huis, hij was een vriend en we talk in the fertilizer like o wat zou het be like if you were the oldest simple and fertilizer I got this look on his face like zou groter zijn dan iedereen. Ik kan alles wat beter doen dan iedereen. Ja, ik denk het. Het is net zoals hij zei bij Default. Second kind. In derde heb ik een complex, maar ze zijn niet het grootste, maar laten we normaal zijn. Mensen hebben een deel in wat er is voor elke, dus het is niet dan? Ja, maar het is gewoon een deel van hun persoonlijke. Ik denk een groot beeld met onze kinderen. Het lijkt misschien een wereld van het fortunetten dat ze go crazy competitieve maar denk zo'n kids can be a lot more ja daar nou ik zeg dat is mooi Ik wil dat er een bepaald moment zijn, maar er zijn veel stages die we hebben gehad. Ja, al dit seizoen is seks. Misschien we gaan morgen redden ja of er just not touchy about it in dezelfde way like freddy wil zeggen like I'm like the best figuur in de wereld en ik doe in het de beste niet nummer 1 en theo weer kennen like oké oké oké Mikey know is hier niet echt je test tegen mij concert er in als je wiel later ja Ja, laten we eens kijken, dat is goed. En dan heb je een goede foundation voor onze friendship. Ik weet niet of we onze kinderen willen friends zijn wanneer ik ouder ben. Nu toe. Oké, let's go to a next question. This 1 pivits on the load back from Ja, just talk about multiple kinderen. Deze vraag is een beetje dieper. The challenge of Racing of haar en tienen kinderen at a time when technology end up takeing over e-parens rol are tech devices damendaal en arme kinderen En wat gaan we doen? Ja, ja, ja. Wat gaan we doen en wat gaan we doen als ouder? Dus ik denk de essentie van this question is een great question how the how are screens and tagger think bij tag them in screens affecting kinderen in general en dan hoe we een proteïne in onze familie, welke een grote vraag? Ja, ik denk dat dat iets is. Ik denk dat dit Alex is vraag. Dank je Alex, dit is een geweldige vraag. Ja, ik denk screens hebben de potentiële to absolute grouane mensen, families, ja. Children? I don't know. I don't know. Ja. Maar de kinderen zijn er gewoon aan, ze weten niet wat ze in je getting into you. Dus een dochter heeft controle over het begin van mij. Het is niet probably the best idea and think people appreciate the additive quality's of the stink people design these 2 Hok you in the same you use them for hours and hours ja en zo ja for us ik bedoel archids Ze doen dingen van TV, maar het is gewoon voor een beetje tijd. Ja, het is gewoon een grote tijd. Nee, het is gewoon een Ja, serieus. Nee, is dat? Ja, ik denk dat twee decisions die we als een familie hebben gemaakt over het hek zo ver zou ik een ander young social all your their all this is only seks amuses and people who said harder because it ex als een vriend. Het was een vriend. Ja, maar wat ik bedoel is dat mensen hun kennis hebben. En maakt het apparaat makkelijker tijd. Wat is dat? TV is echt heel leuk wanneer je nodig hebt. Dat is het heel trucje voor je statement. Dus de twee dingen die we als een family with tech is 1 night we don't have we don't have any tablet but to not give a children a phone of tablet. Het is iets persoonlijks. En in plaats van wanneer we iets wachten, we wachten op de tv. Dus het is een van de community experience, zelfs als I'm not watching it of I'm making it watching it. It's not this type of thing, in states there watching together and it's like a little bit more of a public experience and I'm sure they will change over time as they get ouder but that was kind of 1 of our zoals in ons relationship we live for a long time with our lives here in our house and when we move to this house we had to get a design hoe je het kunt gebruiken en vooral met kinderen dat trucje, dus we zeiden: Nee, persoonlijk device, juist de tv en de tweede was hebben een set time en also ik ken het time of day when they watch something zo dit is waar twoffer als er kids small en sheriff you have een twaalf uur al die zeggen: je bent zo gemakkelijk. Het werkt veel beter als je begint met je hand. Het is veel makkelijker om te zeggen. Dit is wat we doen dan Hé, je wacht al deze tv-wielers, take it away. Ja, dat is niet waar. Je kunt het niet kopen. Je kunt het niet kopen. Ja, het niet kan werken, maar het is niet fijn voor een vrouw. Ja, dus wat we hebben gedaan voor onze kinderen, is er een specifieke tijd van dag. Eigenlijk is het voor lunch of na hun lunch als rond deze tijd en ze voordat misschien een paar maanden geleden heb ik nog nooit gedaan, maar ik heb nog nooit gehoord over wat je in something was te jong, maar twee uur is al die dan ooit bio we use 1 program en this was something that we found with oké swipe ik de kwaliteit of wat er watching is de import en ambitie dat is een very subject wat je kunt noemen qua kwaliteit, maar we hadden een paar laten zien dat we ons ook hebben en de yoga choice één show zoals dertien minuten. Hicoch use which when you wanna watch and when you show is finished it's done that's it so you watch some pieper 30 minutes and now that freddy is al zo dat op een ouder en hij is 1 should should should should should should say in the summer it idee, maar later in de schooljaar. Tijdens de schooljaren ze niet wachten op de weekenden, maar ik vind dit specifieke time-up-dag en specifiek lengte. Het is niet gewoon vijf minuten YouTube-video's en dan en dan is het harder, kan ik dat snel stoppen en ik kan het altijd harder stoppen om te stoppen wanneer je wat in something speciaal is om te kort er is geen definitieve einde, maar voor Arkinsa wordt dus wel, er zijn termen natuurlijk wanneer we of in hun cranky of de fasie maar overal dit zegt wordt zo wel en de truc is het is harder als haar iets want we don't use the tv als een baby sitter voor vier uur is het een er niet wat je nu even twee uur is het een ik denk verliest de de sciences als het nou tweeduizend twintig drie zes de 1 uur of tv per dag voor children over de Age of twee is fijn. Er is geen negatieve consequenties, officieel als ze kijken. Ik weet niet of we een film hebben. Het is geen idee. Bij iets een probably for children en dat de guide minds and I for me a day kan me me geloven of wat geld. Want ik kan niet wachten op tv, er is geen screenshots. En dan ben ik al daar en I feel like I can trust that 1 hour limited time over de age of 2 so under the age of 2 no scenes are kunt vergeten. Maar dit is een kleine idea. Dit is ook kind of family if you're leading a kind of parents I think a special mom's suffering from this you met veel guilty about ja maak je een decision about what their can watch me or whatever may be something think most parents wat er kids watch yes but I think people feel guilty about it Nee, waarschijnlijk doe het, maar dan heb ik veel geld. Dus ik denk dat het best kan verwachten me of wat geld. Anyway passen we do. What about the future? Ik heb een paar dit is? Ja, de Yellow vriendin in de Romeins. Wat doen we? Ja, wat doen we als ze ouder zijn? En het plan is misschien anders van de realiteit. Wel dat ja maar ja we don't have a solide plan ja because ja ik heb zin these phones they're like they can like save phones voor kinderen en ze kunnen like chats. Maar ik kan zelfs chats zijn, maar ik kan zelfs chats zijn. Ja, maar Ja, het is alsof ik veel gebarentaal controle heb. Dus dat zou zijn als één optie, maar ik zou waarschijnlijk een iPhone geven tot hun iPhone. There is. I think I don't know any reason why they were need 1. I did that track in this komt wanneer hun heersers zijn. Ze gaan een depressie geven. En dan, ja, ze komen homo en zeggen: Ik weet niet of ik vond ik je blablabla, why I continuous for ever. That's tricky. Wat ik dan het circus deed. Ik ben mijn werk, ik ben mijn werk, ik ben mijn werk, ik ben mijn werk, mijn werk, mijn werk, mijn mijn jaar. Ik denk dat je er echt van bent. Wel later, Andy. En we zijn op in de 90s. Dat is heel anders, zoals mijn familie hebben een telefoon. Told. Ik heb er geen angst over video-games. Er is altijd een wide-games. Wide-games. Ja er is al erg in tien jaar zou ik in de beach keek nummer wat dat is de week koos hij zei dus als een man die had no teams at the moment but I feel like as a person who have a responsibility to deliver our children safely into a doll uit dat is ook de goal van haar in team. Safeely endless not being a drain on society. I think that's forgot a productieve member. Ja, zo part of technology is not just alone e-logy naar de screen but there are things about being additive technologie or schatting met een schrander online. Het zijn extreem langdurig en ja, er will be I'm sure a lot of attention about why can I use this app swag and I use the social media why you video games vandaag, mijn vrienden doen dit, ik ben er zeker veel aandacht aan met onze kinderen? Dat is in ieder geval, maar ik denk dat is de tricky decision to figure what's the line bij michael is te mixen dat arkins are safe. Nice visitally safe, but like mentally and emotionally safe. And there is more and more evidence showing that more screen time you have de meer apps te gebruiken die je chat met strangers, dit is zo interessant en het is overal so I really want to be aware constantly of wat haar kinderen expo's to en calified train them to realize that Yes, it's hard. Yes, you're not gonna like me about this. Yes, it's gonna be different. Probably from Europe here is duur te naar al is dus om de green booking naar een foto in playing video games altijd maar dat is nog steeds voor het beste. Dus het is moeilijk, ik weet het zeker niet. Ik heb zo ver te hebben van wat ouders en kinderen met 'like mind'? Ja, zoals mijn ouders, ja. Ja, zoals mijn ouders en kinderen, want ik weet niet of het kan ik continu en ik denk ik iets harder bed like as of now a lot of parents of like younger kind of like weer een monteur de use the stuff all the time we als wat is dan voor mij of mijn familie of ik hou van mijn mijn broeders op play fucking man en dan tel je uur des ochtends dat gaan we weer Zo, ja, dat is zo. Als je vrienden bent, denk ik. Ik denk dat ze een hoop hebben. Dus ze hebben vrienden, hoor. Ik vind het symbolere dingen en dan voelen ze ook zo verliefd op. Ja, hopelijk hebben andere ouders een fortune om te zeggen Ja. En persoonlijk, ik kan ook wat bounderby zijn. Alhoewel, ik denk dat er een barrière is zoals Je kunt water testen met iets maken, maken het heel duidelijk druk en zien hoe ze het handelen. Ja, maar ik denk dat het internet en general zo onbeduidend is. De manier waarop je een manier kunt klikken voor een eye-koffie. Ja, dat is gewoon waar je al over denkt. En zo Ik denk dat dat een echt moeilijk gebied is. Ja, je kunt gewoon gewoon gewoon gaan. Ja, nee, Ja, zo. Laten we het idee houden van onze kinderen, gedachten. Een lichaam is safe en het internet is Ik weet het niet, maar ik denk dat ik hoop dat het vooral onze generatie er is meer informatie en meer studies en ik denk dat er een beweging is van Unlimited Technology voor kinderen en door ze people and general ja voor people and general te zeggen ja ik wil je wil ik heb facebook al die jij niet alleen wanna watch youtube al die accepteren after this video's en john watch mij vind ik pas al de politie maar dit kan de idea that it speak worp ik heb me more of de addictive kwaliteit dus ik hoop dat in de future er zal meer mensen willen be careful about the kids consumption of technology in screens and what not? It's not all bad but it's definitely have to be very keer vol. Maar dat is altijd iets hoger op de corner. Ja, gelukkig. Oké, laten we naar onze volgende vraag. We hebben een bonusvraag, laten we kijken of we tijd moeten krijgen. Maar de vorige vraag is: hoe zou je dan meestal managen hoe het werkt en de schildknaap, hoe je besluit wat je wilt zien of wat? En het kleine extra deel van deze vraag is de student die ik graag wil weten wat communicatie is om een zoals Knie was de dishes. Al doet de dishes voor jou, deze tips van expressions. Little teaser, when I talk about the vocabulaire from today's lessen in de een paar weken. Ik geef je een aantal vragen om te praten over choirs. Hoe te delegate choirs? Ik hou altijd de distance voor je toernooi en weet je wat je hoort. Those tips and expressions coming to youtube video be you ja how do we design you will take care of what mijn eerste wall I have to preffice preffice that I think we are ready midden hier in de in de short characterie hoewel ik de meest glamely people Ja, het wordt niet. Misschien een beetje meer dan dat. Is dat het ware? Ja. Als voorbeeld, we hebben clean up time met de kids at night waar we just pick-up stuff and try to put the way. Ik denk dat het enorm is. Ja, zo'n try the on the road better at the end of the day. All I was gonna say is it, it was never Ja, soms dagen we je het niet doen. Ja, het is misschien waarschijnlijk New York, Grabbins. Maar Ja, dat is een van de choices zoals TEDNAP, maar andere choices zijn continuous als Mondriaan en ditches. Ja, de grote. O, 0. Or the kids to see and school needs to be hate or whatever it is like this type of things that just keep your life running how do we de site Google Als je een fragment hebt, zei ik eigenlijk: Ik ga elke single chore doen. Ik had een groot soort growing baby. Ik deed de distance in de laundry, da's de grootste? Ja, da's de grootste? Ja, da's de grootste. En ik denk dat Ik probeer alles op de vloer te brengen, want je kan iets op de vloer kitten. Ik bel je zo groot als ik for a while I think you're just doing like clean the table something ja mind things long work I just to do the linework in Amerika, dat is een groot ding, ik heb een mooiere line. Ja, nu hebben we iemand om dat te doen, want het is een grote tijd. Ik zei: Nou, ik ga naar mijn eigen line en je het like. Ik raad je gewoon gewoon wat tijd voor ons. Ja, vooral omdat we een heel groot jaar hebben Zo. Dat is vooral voor dit moment een leven voor we hebben small kids. Het is beter om dat te delegeren. Ik vind het een groot ding dat voor ons was voor de telgading voor delegating ja was is wil ik jullie de like a business wat ik denk, het huis is een soort van business. We hadden een meeting, ik herinner me dat we een meeting hebben. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een meeting. We hadden een een date, dus dat is een rare vondst. We willen een dag wachten tot een restaurant, een paar drinken. Een paar drinken, we hebben een leuke vondst en we every chore middel things like fix in de kar of dat is een wereld van wow in de wijk make-its aan de kar maar check-in-the-bank account booking naar haar health insurance you know what this little things that come up casual dokters appartements for the kids or zelfs er whatever this type of things that kind of ad-up we will everything go on down and based on other things so in mij prangend in mij not that's also a big responsibility how much am I working how much is then working in not just hours but that mij mental load of you working on a big project or what not does that soort things hoe deed je wat? Dus we doen het gewoon. Voor in de kids de bad. Voor in de kids de bad, dat is een bigger hoor. We dus pre d or wie based on hoe dit wat ze dus kind of strikt delegation maar er was al een rol a strik Ik denk, we pronomist. Het is een important part of Healthy Relationship, of I can say this. Is that when 1 of us with not capable of doing 1 of the shores for example like de dishes if you were if the kids were having such a hard time going to bed and you were really overwhelmed bij that I would do this is Dus er is allemaal Astrik of we helpen elkaar uit. We're not in the same. Nope is not mij choice. I will never do it. Maar we willen in te helpen iets ander oud maar in general like you were down then does this you do it search for en ja kan ik dus figure now why works well because we both work with both take care of the kids if 1 of us did not work totally different situation and because that person job is dat is the house it is the children in new take a serie Het is moeilijker dan een regulier baan als je het allemaal bij jezelf doet. Ik denk dat iedereen dat is crazy. Everyone echt Ja, ga in het werk. Het is op je job. Ja. Stel, voor mij, voor mij, neem ik een keer van de kinderen, is Hai yourself. Speciaally yourself is het meest moeilijk en dan gaan we naar werk. Het is als een break. Ik kan focussen, ik kan een masker maken van het begin tot het einde van het album interruptie. Ik dacht, het gevoel is veel anders. Het is niet zo dat de pater zou moeten zijn. Wauw! Dus Ja, ik denk dat het niet zo leuk is hoe we handelen. En we change over time, want we have 2 kids and then working from home with me. Dan work from home with me. Dat is onze bonus vraag. Dan wordt deze business bezig met ons een aantal jaar, dus dat was een heel anders situatie. We hadden symbolere type jobs, somewhat, we waren bij beide huizen, dus ja, we moesten een beetje organizing and deligate ons choice op een andere manier. So basically whatever works for you maar highly recommend having a medium righting down all the things that moet done and then the terminal. What does what? What do you know? It's a big point of content, I think kampels? Ja, ik denk dat het veel meer kan draaien voor veel mensen. Vooral als één persoon doet om te werken en maakt de geld voor de dingen als een larizeerde be like the other person takes care of al die dingen op de hels ja ik denk dat het kan een beetje sense is het ook belangrijk om te beseffen wat er gebeurt wanneer die persoon komt. Ja, dat is waar. Want de persoon daar kan ik content ja ik denk dat is waar het een point to talk about it and like write on the stuff what you do on the weekends because je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet doen, je wilt het niet het maken van de persoon. Ik weet niet hoe we in ons huis kunnen maken. Ik maak 'm dunner. Ik maak 'm dunner, want als ik met de kinderen ben, maak 'm dunner is ik kan focussen op deze tas. En soms zijn we beginnen met de kinderen, maar in general. Ik denk dat you just decide what's best for your family but it's best to decide together you can work to that before someone explodeed general is een idee alright, dank je voor die prachtige vragen. We hebben een bonus vraag, we hebben het niet de bonus. We hebben het niet in de bonus, maar ik heb het question? Oké. De bonus question is: Dah Dah Dah Hoe is Dah Dah Dah Dah teachers in Glush for a long time. Wauw, ik weet niet of ze dat doen. Yes! Ja, dat was een van mijn studenten in mijn koorts. The violist voor een psycholoog. Ze hebben een deel van ons leven voor een lange tijd. Ze hebben al die informatie geprobeerd, dus gewoon een beetje terug. Ze hebben hart en werk met me. Ik spreek een gush met funda, maken video's. Ik ben de seen. Ik ben de seen. Ik ben de seen. Ik ben de seen. Priding verhaal. Natuurlijk is de all that and then tell us what happens in september last year? What did you do? So now I learned at mij son's school Ik was een assistent-teacher last year. In this year I'm going to be a go science-teacher. It's a little bit a alternative school, so it's not like mijn reguliere classroom setting het een beetje meer integrating outdoors, dus de kinderen zijn eigenlijk outside for half the day en zo dat is als een beetje cool of missing van de school dus dat is wat ik ben doen en de I like it a lot. I like bingenable to go out and do mij own thing. It's not so much working with you but like working with a partner all day long and living with them and and heavy kids and like everybody's in the house I think ik denk het was het is handiger voor ons om het hart van de community want het is specialistisch. Ik wil je in tactically, you were mij passed? Ja, ik denk dat de site in WOLLA's name. Best for your relationship. Maar ik denk er even voor family you working else uit de home you work in a video school specialy why Dat vind ik geweldig. Dat vind ik geweldig. Je bent een able to release I feel good that video is with you. In the day. You're not his teacher at school, but you're at the school. No, no, no, no. Maar kan je niet meer verbinden als je voorkeur hebt. Als iemand ieder heeft van huis of van een nieuw land heeft gewerkt en dan wordt mobile hier dus this kind of isolation des prevalent when you work from home het is echt leuk om verbonden met de community op sommige manieren te zijn en werken is een hele makkelijke manier om te doen. En ik denk ook perfect been perfectly on a spares en patterns dat people discond develop as like work partners or niet goed. Dat was niet leuk voor ons. Het was een was het niet helder als het goed was? Ja, en zo was het leuk dat we iets moeten veranderen. Ja, zeker. Ik denk dat we het beste kunnen bouwen om design te doen. Iets te veranderen. En je wilt niet iets anders troosten of niet? Ja, ik denk dat dat belangrijk is om in je organisatie te realiseren. Dus dan werkt een school nou en vraag was: 'Hardy feel' en 'let's go wild.' Ja, ik voelde het geweldig. Ja, ik voelde het geweldig. Dit werkt I think this works really well. I can't get to go on the point of mij own path and some way they're almost feel like I'm kan het tinkering around the edge of this business which is great business en het is like ja het is amazing en you guys erasem finesses amazing amazing amazing ja het is killing af en doe ik mijn ding voor het belangrijkste deel van de dag. Ik denk dat het een tunnel is voor mij persoonlijk. Ja, ik denk dat het een tunnel voor een familie is. En voor een familie? Ja, want ik denk dat wanneer in je huis is niet feeling well, ik wil zeggen dat je veel in well bent, maar als je je best tijd was ik niet zo grappig. Ja, dat really effects toch al family unit. Dus ik ben blij dat je veel beter bent. Ja, en we hadden een site hadden hun buren meestal, dus dat was is het meest te hebben. Een ander verhaal? Het is echt een ander verhaal. Zelfs al van jullie zijn vrienden. Of we geen video every day? Nee, ik bedoel. Ja, wat denk je dat je zoveel meer wilt beantwoorden? Dat is wat het meeste, maar het is heel erg persoonlijk.

The holiday in Paris, obviously, get shout out Oh, we had personal as far per. Dealers grill as per. Right? And ask. And, you know, if you have any Danish related questions or whatever, right to us danish chubducks at gmail dot com. And today, it was we have a message from Tiffany. She asked, yeah, who's your dad's personal can do Why is it when you have a sentence like that it sometimes becomes Without r, why does the verb drop the r and end in e like species, bisa, fattila, fattila, so or soa. Spokeing the hell out of me, and I'm awful at grammar. I actually gave her a quick response and said, well, actually, you never say, yes, swimmer without any. Sorry, without without an r. Always have an r. But do you know do you know anything more about this, Pineda? Could you So to added Tiffany. Tiffany? Tiffany. Yeah. Tiffany, can can see yeah. I can therma, or a yeah, vial film. Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm. Exactly. So basically, when you have these modal verbs and there's basically 4 of them that are very common can Scal will mow. There's a couple of other ones, but they're the most useful ones. Anytime you use 1 of those, the second verb will not have an r on it. But anytime you write like just a pronoun like I, he, she, you will always have an r, if it's in present tense. Yeah. It's fuma, With an r. You only not, of course, if it's in past tense. So That's basically it. I think I don't think it's any more complex than that. So I hope that helped you, Tiffany.

Or doing it every other week or something. So just know how to talk about your interest by just simply making a sentence in English and they're just translating that. Sappella, the juices. The the the emojibes, Yeah. Yeah. Yet. Must miss it. I didn't I didn't write No. The I didn't write the miss it. That Miss it? Month. 1 time a month. A crack every month. Every month.

Plamed. Plamed? Like Oh, So what do you think you would need to work on just your own feedstock to yourself? Oh, In English Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now now I can get comfortable. Yes. In English, I think What I'm struggling with again, right, is vocab. I know a lot of words, but now even though you say, don't worry about past tense, present tense. But when I speak to people, I don't wanna sound ignorant. So what I'm working on is past tense and because now tense, what is it called? Present tense. Present. Present tense? Sorry. Not now tense. Put that out. No. No. No. Keep it that in. President tense is the easiest. Yes. It's past and future that I just could get confused, but now prefixes. Right? That's what I'm in. That's what I'm trying to do right now and be prefixes, and what's the other 1? Aspects. Aspects. Yeah. That's exactly me. We actually covered that right now in the camp. We just go our camp right now. Yeah. By the way, plug. If you want to speak just as good as Victoria, I'll make a nice progress as she did. Join our b Flinke with the first link in the description. You're going through it right now. Give me give me your feedback right away or recommend it or don't recommend it to to the people who are watching. You know, I'm a recommend it. You know, I'm gonna recommend it. It's just I think for me, because I'm already behind, I feel like it's moving so fast. My advice to anybody that's in there is to keep up with the work and really pays yourself Right. Because you can't talk I mean, I have you. But I'm thinking if I was a student behind. Yeah. Oh, really? Well, my gosh. Like, I'm missing out. So make sure you keep up with the task each week and really do them. Don't just say, oh, let me just write a real quick sentences because I did that right and I'm struggling now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, but to speak, I feel like my of it has been a lot is I've improved a lot Mhmm. Because at my modeling shoots, most of the people don't speak English. Yeah. So literally 3 times a week. I'm speaking with people outside of fedor because I'm used to your accent. I'm used to your family's accent, your Bob Buschka de Dushka. But when I speak to these new people that maybe talk a little quieter or, like, have a different accent kind of a Ukrainian. I have to be like, what? I have to really listen and sometimes I make, like, little sentences to ask, am I looking okay? How's my nose? Before I enter the set, so I can just know. Neither cleared. Be prepared because a week and a half ago, I was so prepared for the shoot. Right? I was speaking with him a Russian, I was feeling myself. But this last shoot that I went on stayed up all night, didn't get enough sleep, didn't do a beautiful and camp. I wouldn't have. That's right. I didn't I I I'm behind on, like, 2 weeks, and I could really speak. And I'm, like, oh my gosh, it's terrible. So I realized when I do it every day when I keep it with the not even with the task. When I watch I'm on season 2 of cooking now on non biflon camp, a biflon class as well, where you have TV shows and all that stuff. I love TV. For door locks, video games, I can watch 5 episodes. And I keep playing video games o night. That's all night. But because I know I like TV, what I do is look at the subtitles on your website, and then I watch the coconut episode 3 times. And that's what helps me and I write down the words, he said something so funny. He said, Doroc. Mhmm. He said Doroches danish. Like, the kitchen is on fire and I Yeah. It was so funny. Now I know how to say do rock, you know? Yeah. So, on b fluent class, when I watch cooking her 3 times, I first, when I watched the first episode, I don't know what they're saying most of the time. Yeah. So I write down the words that I don't know. And on before in class, you have the translation, so it makes it easier for you. Yeah. And that's why I love your platform. But yeah, guys, even though you get with the platform, you also have to do the task. You have to remember Yeah. To do the task and sometimes I forget when on vacation, I didn't do a lot of Russian, and then I came back, like, why did I do that to myself? Because now I'm starting all over. You know? For next time, I would say that for for our time when we go this next time. Yeah. What do you think I would say? Probably, what I would do next time is I'll do the topic. And maybe even to the questions because it's it's always great to prepare for the exact topic so you can know the vocabulary know the words, know the phrases, not to read them, but at least you know them and then you put it into practice right then and there. Do you guys hear him saying this? Because for door loves to tell me, hey, let's make a video in Russian. I'll tell you the topic when we record. And that's because it has to be French and No. Right now. Like that because you guys can't see much progress with all the words that I learned just like I explained in the last video. But I hate that. Thank you for coming Victoria. We're gonna do this again in a few in a few weeks hopefully. And join our evening camp with this button right here. Let's learn together. I'll be there with you guys, give you feedback to your work, and you can even get on the phone with me and have a conversation with me there as well. Chicken a lot. Yes. And don't forget that there's beginner and intermediate Yeah. To just help you out in what level that you're in. I'm in intermediate right now. Yes. So It's difficult. See you all later.
